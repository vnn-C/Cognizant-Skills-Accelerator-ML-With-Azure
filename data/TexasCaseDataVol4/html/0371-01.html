Incompetent Testimony. — Boaz sued appellants for malicious prosecution, the prosecution being a charge of embezzlement. Shortly before the charge was made the store house of appellants had been set on fire in the nighttime. Boaz was in charge of the business carried on in the house that was set on fire. On the trial, it was error to admit in evidence on behalf of Boaz his own declarations, that “hecould not blame Hurlbut &amp; Semple for prosecuting him; that they had to do it in order to vindicate themselves, as the people of Brown-wood believed that they instigated him to burn the house.” The same witness who detailed this, also testified, “that he heard John Summers and Charles Turner say that the people of Brownwood thought Hurlbut &amp; Semple instigated Boaz to burn their house.” The testimony was irrelevant, and calculated to injure the defendants.</p>
