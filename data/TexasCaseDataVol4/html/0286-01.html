Refusal of.—Appellees sued for a, balance due them for running a hotel, and for refusal of appellantto renew the lease. Provision in the lease as to renewal was, that appellees were to have the refusal of a lease on said hotel for a term of three years, at price and upon conditions then <em>to </em>be agreed upon. Appellees did not apply for a renewal, and shortly before the expiration of the year it was leased to another party. Appellees failed to show a cause of action for the recovery of damages for breach of the contract. The stipulation for the further lease for three years depended upon the agreement of the parties, both as to price and conditions. It was not an agreement to renew the existing contract, but an expression of preference for her over others, and she made no effort to obtain a new lease.</p>

If appellees had had an agreement for renewal or extension, or the making of a lease, and had been wrongfully ejected from the premises, then there might be facts and circumstances attending the ejectment which, brought to the knowledge of the defendant company and ratified by it, would have entitled the appellees to the recovery of exemplary damages.</p>

There were no objections to the report filed by either party, and the case was tried by a jury on September 14, 1891, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs for the balance due on salary, the several items of expenditure which plaintiffs alleged they had made, the sum of $1000 actual damages, and $1000 exemplary damages; but the plaintiffs entered in the court below a remittitur of the amount found by the jury as exemplary damages on the day the motion for a new trial was overruled.</p>

While the testimony of Mrs. Hanaford, that a renewal of the lease for three years would have been worth at least $1200 to her, was probably not admissible as a conclusion of the witness, it was not objected to, and she was not cross-examined as to the facts upon which she based her conclusion, and it might therefore support the verdict as to the amount if a breach of contract had been shown. The stipulation in the contract in favor of the plaintiffs for the refusal of a lease of the property for three years depended entirely upon the agreement of the parties, both as to the price and the condition of the lease, and was not an agreement for a renewal of the contract for the management of the hotel, as it seems to have been treated by both counsel for plaintiffs and the court below. Plaintiffs had no agreement for a lease, and the evidence shows that there was no effort to obtain one. ■ Mrs. Hanaford testified, that she was relying on her contract; but her contract was ■one for services as manager of the hotel, with an expression of preference for her over other persons, if at the end of the year she and the hotel company could agree on the price and conditions of a lease, and in such event an agreement to lease for three years.</p>
