    <p id="b328-8" data-blocks='[["BL_328.12",328,[276,1496,1299,434]]]'>There was error also in sustaining the exceptions of appellee to appellant’s plea of limitation against the claim of $250 for loss of the oat crop of 1888.

This alleged promise, however, is not satisfactorily alleged in the petition. In the absence of such a promise on the part of ■appellant’s agent, if the machine was not what it was represented and warranted to be, the damage recoverable, if not barred by limitation, would be for breach of warranty, which would ordinarily be the difference in value between the machine in question and the kind it was represented to be.</p>
