Power of County Judge to Order and Approve a Sale of Land in April, 1870.—A sale ordered by the probate judge in February, 1870, and made April 5,1870, and confirmed thereafter, was void, because prior thereto the County Courts as courts of probate had been abolished by the Constitution of 1869, and probate jurisdiction vested in the District Courts.</p>

Effect of the Constitution of 1869 Upon the County Court.— The Constitution of 1869 abolished the County Court, and its judiciary article distributed all of the judicial power of the State among the courts named therein, and left no room for the further existence of such courts as the County Courts had been; and after these provisions went into practical operation, no probate jurisdiction existed in any but the District Court.</p>

Constitutional Provision Construed.—The last clause of section 7,. article 5, of Constitution of 1869, after defining the jurisdiction of the District Court, concludes, “under such rules and regulations as maybe prescribed by law," which is claimed to have the effect of suspending the article until such time as legislation should be had adopting rules and regulations for the guidance of the District Court in the exercise of probate jurisdiction. The majority of the court is of opinion that the provision of the Constitution defining the jurisdiction of the District Court should be treated simply as a readoption of similar provisions which had run through the previous Constitutions, with the addition of larger powers, which might be exercised in accordance with laws already in force governing other tribunals to which such powers had formerly belonged.</p>

Effect of the Military Government Existing in Texas.—The fact that the person who made the orders of sale and confirmation in question, held his position with the sanction of the military government existing in Texas, did not prevent the Constitution from taking effect so as to abolish the County Court, until after those orders were passed. The principles of law which uphold the acts of de facto officers have no application, and we know of no respectable authority for holding that there may be a de facto judge of a court which has no legal existence. The reconstruction laws ceased to operate in Texas on March 30,1870, and with them fell such powers as they had conferred upon the district commander.</p>

Section 6 of this article provides, that the State shall be divided <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>into convenient judicial districts, and that the Governor, by and with consent of the Senate, shall appoint one judge for each district, who shall hold his office for eight years, and shall hold a court three times a year, in each county of his district, at such time and place as may be prescribed by law; and section 7 is in these words: “ The District Court shall have original jurisdiction of all criminal cases; of all causes in behalf of the State to recover penalties, forfeitures, and escheats; and of all suits and cases in which the State may be interested; of all cases of divorce; of’all suits to recover damages for slander or defamation of character; of all suits for the trial of title to land; of all suits for the enforcement of liens; and of all suits, complaints, and pleas whatever, without regard to any distinction between law and equity, when the matter in controversy shall be valued at or amount to $100, exclusive of interest; and the said courts, and the judges thereof, shall have power to issue the writ of habeas corpus, and all other writs necessary to enforce their own jurisdiction, and to give them a general superintendence and control over inferior tribunals.

Construing the first, sixth, and seventh sections of article 5 together, it is clear to my mind that it was not the intention of the convention to confer probate jurisdiction upon the District Court created by the Constitution of 1866; but a new tribunal of justice, possessing all the powers of both the District and County Courts then existing, was provided for, and when organized was to supersede both the District and County Courts created by the Constitution of 1866.</p>

As a matter of history, we know that the District and the County Courts continued in the exercise of their jurisdictions long after the adoption of the Constitution in December, 1869; and if the law be as held by a majority of this court, then all that was done by the judiciary of this State between the time of the election held in November and December of 1869, and the day on which the act of the Legislature organizing the District Courts, which I believe was on the 10th of August, 1870, must be held to be null and void; and the titles to property honestly bought and paid for, under judgment and decrees of the County Courts, and now aggregating in value perhaps millions, are worthless.</p>

I can see nothing in this view of the subject in conflict with the decision in the case of Peak v. Swindle. I have no doubt of the correctness in that decision. When the Constitution was adopted by the people of the State, that instrument immediately took effect, and was operative in all of its parts as far as practicable; and it was suspended in none of its provisions to await the action of Congress in admitting the State into the Union. But it is too plain to admit of argument, that the judicial article of the Constitution was not self-operative.
