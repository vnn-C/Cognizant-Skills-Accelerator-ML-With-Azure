They appointed a committee of three to make a contract with said company for the purpose of carrying into effect the subscription; and authorizing and empowering said committee “ to make a suitable contract with the said railway company, and to provide therein for the time and manner of collecting this subscription, and all other details that may be found necessary as to the location of depots, <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>and whatever else there may be to the interest of our town in making the same; and a majority of said committee is hereby authorized to act, their action to be as binding as if specified in this agreement; provided, that, there shall not be collected of said subscription more than 15 per centum per month, after the construction shall have been actually-begun.”</p>

The contract recites a contract made between the committee and Britton &amp; Lyon, by which Britton <em>&amp; </em>Lyon were to carry out that part of the contract between the railroad and the committee which was to be performed by the citizens, and the railway company accepted Britton &amp; Lyon to do the work agreed on.

    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[160,492,1302,627]]]'>When the case of Darnell v. Lyon, which involved the construction of the contract herein, was pending before the Court of Civil Appeals of the Second Supreme Judicial District, that court certified to our Supreme Court for decision the same questions, in substance, that are here in issue. In passing upon the first question, they answered in the following language: “We are clearly of the opinion that the first question should be answered in the affirmative, although the words, ‘ we, the undersigned, hereby promise and agree,’ if unqualified, would import a joint undertaking; yet the subsequent provision in the writing, that ‘ each subscriber, should 1 be liable only for the amount opposite his name,’ leaves no doubt that the intention was that the obligation was to be several.” This is conclusive of this question, and coincides with our construction of the contract.</p>
    <p id="b613-7" data-blocks='[["BL_613.6",613,[161,1138,1300,439]]]'>The Supreme Court seems to have met with some difficulty in reaching a conclusion as to a proper solution of the second proposition. It did, however, reach the conclusion, that the committee exceeded its authority in making the contracts with Britton <em>&amp; </em>Lyon and with the railway company. The action of the committee being without authority, the said contracts are of no binding force and effect as against appellant, unless he has ratified the action of said committee, as alleged by the appellee. The question of a ratification not having been passed upon, necessitates a remanding of this cause for an adjudication of that issue.</p>

The railway company, under the contract, was to equip, maintain, and operate the road, and to build engine houses and machine shops in the city of Sherman, and to make that point the end of a division. This constitutes an entire contract; and if it is shown that the railway company has failed to perform any material condition in the contract, a recovery can only be had to the extent of the performance on its part, if it is shown that such part performance is beneficial to those within the contemplation of the contract; such recovery not to exceed the ratio that such part performance bears to the whole contract. Hilliard v. Crabtree, 11 Texas, 264; Weiss v. Devlin, 67 Texas, 507; Batsell v. Railway, decided at this term, ante, p. 580.</p>
