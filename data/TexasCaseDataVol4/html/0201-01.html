Petition—Evidence Under General Denial.—D. sued B. on a note for $175, with 8 per cent interest, and 10 per cent on amount as attorney fees, and to foreclose vendor’s lien on certain lots, vendor’s lien expressly reserved in the note. The petition did not expressly allege the execution and delivery of the note, but alleged an indebtedness by reason of the note, setting it out in full. B. answered by general denial, and on the trial objected to the introduction of the note: (1) Because it was not alleged that the note was executed by him. (2) Note was not the best evidence to show lien. (3) It showed that the deed was the best evidence of such lien. <em>Held:</em>
