The fifth finding of fact is not the fair and legitimate deduction from the evidence. The evidence clearly and unequivocally established, that after appellants filed their affidavit and claim bond, and ■obtained possession of the goods in controversy, they instituted suit in Lamar County for the value of the balance of the goods not retaken under claimants’ oath and bond. The suit in Lamar County was based upon the account for the entire bill of goods, amounting in the aggregate to $2669.50, but there was a credit upon the account of $1204.74, stated to be “ the value of certain goods taken back,” and the items ap<a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>pearing in the account of the goods which had been taken in the claim proceedings were clearly identified by exhibit and the affidavit proving the account. The goods in controversy in this suit were not sought to be recovered for in the Lamar County suit; no recovery was sought or had beyond the value of the goods which appellants were unable to find and retake in the claim proceeding. The judgment rendered in Lamar County for the value of that portion of the goods purchased of appellants by Munzesheimer <em>&amp; </em>Klein which had not been retaken, it is admitted, was fully satisfied by proceeds from sale of goods attached in that suit. The parties to the Lamar County suit were Otto I-Ieinze <em>&amp; </em>Co., plaintiffs, and Munzesheimer <em>&amp; </em>Klein, defendants; and the issue involved and determined by the judgment was the value of the goods not recovered by appellants in the claim proceeding, in the form of a suit upon account for such balance.

They had under the law the option of rescinding the contract of sale and proceeding by appropriate remedy to recover their property, or of affirming the sale and pursuing Munzesheimer &amp; Klein upon the contract debt. If they elected to rescind the contract of sale and pursue the property to recovery, the effective and appropriate legal remedy open to them was the statutory proceeding of the trial of the right of property under claimant’s oath and bond, the goods having been seized by appellees under attachment.

This proposition we think is <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>wholly untenable. There was no other contract between appellants and Munzesheimer &amp; Klein in relation to these goods except a contract of sale. By the filing of the affidavit and bond, appellants asserted title in themselves, and thereby repudiated the sale which would have conveyed title to Munzesheimer &amp; Klein, had it been legal and binding upon appellants. The statute under which appellants proceeded does not require that the nature of the claim or title to the property should be stated, and it is not perceived that any good reason exists why appellants should have given more specific notice of their repudiation of the sale than was necessarily contained in the statutory proceedings adopted.</p>

The appellees were not parties to that suit; they had no interest in the subject matter involved therein; they did not rely and act on the conduct of appellants in that suit, or the recitals contained in the judgment therein.

Wilkins, 60 Texas, 414, it is said: “The general rule, that judgments are not binding on strangers, is so far mutual, that strangers can not take advantage of the same to affect the parties to them. * * * Where strangers have acted upon the faith of recitals in a judgment or decree to their injury, then ordinarily they can assert it as an estoppel against the parties.” Had the property involved in this suit, upon which appellees had an attachment lien, also been involved in the Lamar County suit, or had they acted upon the recitals in the Lamar County judgment in causing their levy to be made and lien fixed on the property, a different question would be presented for decision. The Lamar County suit could in no possible way affect injuriously the rights or interests of appellees; their attachment was levied before the institution of that suit; the property levied upon was in no sense affected by it, and it was certainly a matter of no concern to them if appellants followed up the common debtor and recovered compensation for the balance of their goods which they could not discover and take in the claim suit. <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>We fail to perceive any sound reason why appellees should be benefited by the Lamar County suit, to appellants’ injury. The right to rescind the contract of sale existed at the time the statutory claim was made; the-election to rescind was made and the right to maintain this suit was fixed by the filing of the claimants’ oath and bond. Can it be said that this-right was extinguished by appellants’ effort, under a different form of action, to recover the value of the balance of the goods which the debtors had wrongfully disposed of, and which could not be found and recovered f When appellants elected to rescind the contract of sale, and in consummation of that election instituted the claim proceeding to recover the goods, the contract of sale was as if it had never existed, and no act of appellants alone could restore its existence. The same acts originally necessary to create the contract relation would be necessary to restore the-contract of sale rescinded. Moller v.

We have been cited to no authority, and have been unable to find any, which holds that a suit of a creditor to recover goods fraudulently obtained can not be maintained, for the reason that he subsequently brought suit and obtained judgment upon account for the value of a balance of goods sold at the same time, which he could not find and retake, and is thereby estopped from pursuing the property. We do not think the general principles of estoppel sanction the proposition; and the cases to which we have been cited by appellants negative the doctrine. Sleeper v.

    <p id="b630-6" data-blocks='[["BL_630.6",630,[270,1782,1304,586]]]'>In this State technical forms of action have been abolished; it is only required that the facts constituting the cause of action shall be stated in the pleading in order to obtain the appropriate relief, either in law or equity. And it would seem to be out of harmony with the spirit of our system to hold one estopped in a suit by the form of action adopted in another suit, when he would not have been estopped by a truthful recital of the facts constituting his cause of action. Such is this case. Had the appellants in the Lamar County suit alleged that the goods were obtained by the established fraudulent acts of the debtors, and that they were worth the price agreed to be paid for them, a recovery would have been had for their value, and the suit would have been entirely consistent with the claim proceeding.</p>
