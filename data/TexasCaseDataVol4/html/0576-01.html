Fire Insurance.—Flippen obtained from appellant a policy of fire insurance for $2500. which permitted insurance in the additional amount of $2500 to be effected on the property, and provided that the policy should become void if the assured have or shall hereafter obtain any other policy or agreement for insurance, whether valid or not, on the property, or any part thereof.” Other insurance, aggregating $15,500, existed on the property when appellant's policy was issued. No waiver of the provisions of appellant’s policy as to additional insurance being shown, <em>held, </em>the policy never took effect.</p>

Same — Cancellation of Policy. — Unless a policy of fire insurance contains a provision for a cancellation at the option of the company, it has no power to cancel by notice and tender of the unearned premium.

The plaintiff died pending the suit, and his widow and only heir, J. V. Flippen, became plaintiff. One of the defenses set up by the de<a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>fendant company was, <em>that the </em>assured, at the time the policy was issued,, already held additional insurance beyond the amount permitted by the policy, without notice to or consent of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[287,481,1301,380]]]'>The fourth assignment of error is as follows: “The court erred in refusing special charge number 1 asked by the defendant, to the effect, that the jury should find for the defendant, because a material condition of the policy had been violated, in that the uncontroverted evidence showed that the insured had valid and existing insurance on the property in a much larger amount than permitted by the terms of the policy here sued on, and reference is made to said special charge as a part of this assignment.”</p>

It further shows, that the policy sued on permitted additional insurance to the amount of $2500, or a total insurance of 85000; and the evidence further shows, that there was more than $2500 additional insurance, or more than $5000 total insurance; therefore a material condition of said policy has been violated, and you must find for the defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b602-8" data-blocks='[["BL_602.8",602,[285,1828,1298,388]]]'>Do the facts of this case show or tend to show that at the time the policy sued on in the case was issued the other policies had been cancelled ? The evidence was as follows: The policy issued by defendant company was for $2500, and permitted an additional amount of $2500 of insurance to be effected on the property; and it contained a provision that the policy should become void, “ if the assured have or shall hereafter obtain any other policy or ageeemenfc for insurance, whether valid or not, on the property * * * or any part thereof.”</p>

It was shown that Parks et al., trustees of the Mechanics Bank of St. Louis, holding the policies by transfer from Meyer <em>&amp; </em>Aronson, who held them through M. V. Flip-pen, the insured, had sued after the fire and recovered judgments on policies covering the same property, against the following companies and for the amounts named: Hartford Fire Insurance Company for $2522.40; Citizens Fire Insurance Company for $560.31; Hanover Fire Insurance Company for $1121.02; Connecticut Fire Insurance Company for 8840.80; Home Fire Insurance Company for $1681.60; Phoenix Fire Insurance Company for $1680.53.</p>

That on the 19th of February, 1885, he, under instruction from his companies, went to Flippen to cancel the policies. That Flippen told him that the policies were held as shown in the proofs of loss, and declined to receive the unearned premiums, but directed him to send them to the parties holding the policies, who were entitled to them. That witness remitted by mail drafts to the parties mentioned for the policies held by each of them. That the draft sent to Lehman, Abram <em>&amp; </em>Co. was received by them and paid. That that sent to Meyer &amp; Aronson was received by them, but returned to witness uncollected and unpaid, with the information that under the circumstances, <em>inasmuch as the fire had </em>occurred, they could not accept it. That defendant company’s policy was issued on the day that Beard, as agent for the other insurance companies, had the above conversation with M. V. Flippen, and Hagey, the agent, was told that all other insurance had been cancelled.</p>
