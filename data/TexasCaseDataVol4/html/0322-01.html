In this way a number of complicated questions could have been avoided which may arise as to the validity of debts undertaken to be created between the time of the attempted incorporation and the institution of the quo warranto proceedings to test its validity.

It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court, that the relief sought by plaintiff in this suit, to-wit, a dissolution of the incorporation of the town of Iowa Park, Texas, be and is hereby refused, and that said plaintiff take nothing by this suit. It is further ordered, that the defendants, I-I. C. Fuller, mayor; M. G. Cottrell, marshal; and R. S. Simons, C. W. Orr, W. Gibson, George Ligón, and E. A.

When these proceedings were offered in evidence by respondents, the bill of exceptions says the court sustained plaintiff’s objection thereto, “on the ground that said judgment in said cause number 417 was void;” but the particular ground upon which it was held invalid is not disclosed. We infer, however, from appellants’ brief, that it was upon the ground that the district attorney had no power to make the agreement upon which it was based.</p>

It4s not denied that the court which rendered this judgment had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the litigation, and the power to render such a decree, and in such case its judgment would not be subject to collateral attack, even though the agreement upon which it was based would not be binding upon the parties if directly called in question.

The State was the complaining party in both, although her relators were different. In Mathews v. The State, 82 Texas, 577, it is well said, that these prosecutions are under the exclusive control of the State’s attorney, and not the relators; and the conclusion announced in Hunnicutt v. The State, 75 Texas, 233, to the effect that the State’s officer might file the information without any relator at all, is approved. In fact, that proceedings by quo warranta to dissolve municipal corporations are in contemplation of law instituted for the benefit of the public, and the State'is therefore the real prosecutor, would seem to be elementary. 19 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 675, 676.</p>
    <p id="b349-6" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[141,1244,1300,1082]]]'>Respondents then proposed to show that the State, in a proceeding instituted by her, had been, by one of her own courts to which she had confided the jurisdiction to determine such questions, adjudged not to be entitled to the relief sought by her in this case; and if the party with whom she was litigating in both cases be the same in law, it would seem that the first judgment should have been held to be conclusive. 19 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 684; High on Ex. Leg. Rem., 746. Then, were the respondents in both cases in legal contemplation the same ? We think this question must be answered in the affirmative. The parties really interested on the side of the respondents were the inhabitants of the territory sought to be incorporated as the town of Iowa Park, and as they were too numerous to be joined by name, the State in both suits selected the men they had chosen as their officers as fairly representing the interests of all, and in this suit claims the right to annul the proceedings taken to incorporate as to those who are not parties by name as well as to those who are; and under these circumstances we think she is in no position to deny the right of the parties she has made to effectually litigate the matters in controversy, and should be held bound by a decree in their favor to the same extent they would be bound by a decree in her favor. We think these conclusions fairly deducible from the following authorities and the cases referred to therein: Ewing v. The State, 81 Texas, 172; 1 Freem. on Judg., 178, 170, 157.</p>

Mathews v. The State, and 19 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 675, supra.</p>

The charge of the court was perhaps a little too restricted in conveying this idea to the jury, yet we are not prepared to say there is such error therein as should require a reversal.</p>
