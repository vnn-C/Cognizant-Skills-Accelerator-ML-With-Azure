Record not Perfected after Decision. —Appellants’ motion shows that there was a certificate to the statement of facts, which the clerk inadvertently omitted from the transcript, and certiorari to perfect the record is asked. It has long been the rule, that parties must see that the record is complete before the case has been submitted, and the court, after a decision, will not allow it to be reopened in order to bring up matter that should have been embraced in the record.

A complete answer to this, without looking further, is, that the cause was not submitted for about eight months after the transcript was filed, during all of which time it was within the power of both parties to examine and perfect the record. If a sufficient excuse could be given for such an omission, after the decision of the cause, appellants have not done so, and the motion is overruled.</p>
