It was shown that the parties to whom the bill of sale was executed were required to give full receipt for their entire claims, and that the guardian attempted to pay off his ward in same way, and the property transferred, according to estimate in bill of' sale, was not sufficient to pay full amount of said claims. There was no proof that any Probate Court had passed upon and approved the acts of said guardian. It was proven that John La Prelle reserved in his hands $2500 in notes and accounts, not included in the bill of sale.</p>

The-evidence shows the goods levied on in this case to be worth about 55 cents on the dollar.</p>

The evidence showed that she, after her marriage, sold 200 acres of land, and the proceeds of the sale, $2500, were loaned to her husband, John La Prelle. The will of Talbot was offered for the purpose of showing that this 200 acres tract was devised to her by the terms of the will. The evidence shows that the consideration for the conveyance to Mrs. La Prelle was the debt that John La Prelle owed her for the money that he had used, arising from the sale of the land.</p>

It fairly appears from the certificate of the officer that the paper offered in evidence is a copy of the records required by law to be kept for preserving the proceedings of the Probate Court. There is no merit in the objection, that it does not appear from the certificate that the paper is a copy of the record or minutes of the court. The second objection, and the only one that we deem important to notice, is, that the record offered in evidence appears to be a copy of the judgment of the Probate Court of Robertson County, made in 1889, correcting the record of the former judgment made in 1882, probating the will of James Talbot; the contention being, that the court had no power or jurisdiction in 1889 to correct or amend the record probating the will in 1882.</p>

In 1889 the same court, by an order, corrected this mistake, and ordered that the record be so amended as to make it show the true facts, and that the will be properly recorded.</p>

This record, when so made, becomes the judgment of the court. Articles 1354 and 1355, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, empower the court to correct any mistake or misrecital in its judgments; and when its judgment correcting such mistake is collaterally questioned, as is done in this case, we must conclusively presume that the court followed the procedure prescribed by the two articles referred to, and that such judgment is legal. It does not appear upon the face of the record that the court, in correcting its record, did not pursue the law that authorizes the correction to be made. Because the judgment correcting the mistake is made after a long lapse of time from the entry of the original judgment, is no reason why the correcting judgment is void, and is not a reason <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>for denying the court jurisdiction to correct its records. It is held, that the remedy provided by these statutes is not governed by any period of limitation fixed by law. Ramsey v. McCauley, 9 Texas, 106.</p>

But we think this evidence, as well as that of any other witness who is able, by a knowledge of facts, to trace the ownership of the funds used by John La Prelle to the separate estate of his wife, is admissible. It is not a controversy in which the title to the land devised to Mrs. La Prelle by the will is involved. But the fact in issue is simply tracing back the source from which the funds' arose. Witnesses may know that this fund arose from the sale of property that belonged to the wife in her separate right, and that fact may be proven either by the will or by the evidence of witnesses who are acquainted with the facts. It is not a question wherein a title to the land is involved, for the wife may not have a good title; but if land came to her in such a way as to be her separate property under the law, and it should be sold, the proceeds of the sale, as between her and her husband, would be her separate property, notwithstanding her title may be inferior to that of some one with a better title.</p>

In the final conclusion reached by the court, that the sale, as to the interests of James La Prelle, the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company, Mrs. Eosa La Prelle, and Eeagan Dickson, was fraudulent as to the creditors of John La Prelle, on account of the combination and conspiracy between James La Prelle and John La Prelle to defraud the creditors of John La Prelle, there is no finding or disposition made of the interest of Mrs. Talbot that descended to Mrs. Eosa La Prelle.</p>
    <p id="b413-5" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[150,704,1302,626]]]'>Mrs. Eosa La Prelle would receive the interest of her deceased mother, Mrs. Talbot, in the same condition it existed when descent was cast; and if Mrs. Talbot’s title was free of any fraud as to the creditors of John La Prelle, Mrs. Eosa La Prelle would receive it in the same condition. The effect of the findings of the court would seem to negative the existence of any fraud upon the part of Mrs. Talbot in acquiring her interest or title in the property. And looking to the evidence upon this issue, it does not establish the fact that she participated in any scheme to defraud the creditors of John La Prelle. We do not wish to be understood that we entertain the opinion that the finding of the court on the issue of fraud was correct, or that it was supported by the evidence as to the interest of the other plaintiffs. That is a matter we leave to be determined upon another trial.</p>

Talbot and his wife, Mrs. Eosa F. La Prelle, the debts recited in the bill of sale executed by him, and that the property transferred was not of greater value than sufficient to satisfy the said debts, and that the purpose of said parties in purchasing said property was to collect their debts, although John La Prelle was insolvent, and although his purpose may have been to defraud his creditors, and such purchasers may have known that such would be the result of the sale, and such facts were known to them, we do not understand that in such case the law would hold the sale fraudulent as to the other creditors. A creditor who has a bona fide claim against his debtor, and in good faith receives a transfer of his debtor’s property for the purpose of satisfying his claim, and receives no more than sufficient for that purpose, will be protected, although his debtor may be insolvent, and may intend to clefraud his other creditors, and such facts be known to the creditor at the time of his purchase.
