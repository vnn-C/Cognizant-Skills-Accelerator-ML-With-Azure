Evidence oí Negligence held Insufficient.—Plaintiff’s horse came to its death without negligence of defendant, from a wound received while being driven over defendant's railway, and which was inflicted by a nail which had been used by defendant in constructing or repairing its track. Under these facts a judgment for damages for the injury is reversed.</p>

Knowledge of Dangerous Condition of Track Requisite.—To constitute negligence on the part of a street car company because its track was left in such a condition as to render it dangerous to animals passing through the streets, it must be shown that the company knew of such dangerous condition of the track, or that facts were shown such as would charge the company with notice.</p>

    <p id="b659-11" data-blocks='[["BL_659.19",659,[155,1870,1304,326]]]'>“ 8. The verdict of the jury is contrary to and is not supported by the evidence, and is against the great preponderance of the evidence, in this, that there was no evidence showing that the nail which penetrated the foot of plaintiff’s horse was placed on the track or street by the defendant, or that the said nail was in any plank on defendant’s track, or in any plank belonging to defendant, or in any way connected with defendant’s road or track.</p>
    <p id="b659-12" data-blocks='[["BL_659.20",659,[158,2217,1304,285]]]'>“9. The verdict of the jury is unauthorized by the evidence, and wholly without evidence to support it, because, even admitting that the horse of plaintiff had a nail penetrate his foot on defendant’s track, there is no evidence to warrant the jury in finding that such nail was placed there by the defendant, or that such nail was ever used by or owned by the defendant in or about its track in any manner whatever.</p>

The evidence, if considered from the aspect most favorable to the appellee, established this, and nothing more, that the plaintiff’s horse came to its death, without negligence on part of plaintiff, from a wound received while being driven over defendant’s railway, and which was inflicted by puncture from a nail, which had been used by defendant in constructing or repairing its railway track.</p>

If the defendant’s track was in such condition as rendered it dangerous to animals passing through the streets, the evidence does not show, that defendant knew of such condition; nor does the evidence show facts which would charge defendant with notice.</p>
