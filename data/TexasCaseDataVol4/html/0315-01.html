    <p id="b341-9" data-blocks='[["BL_341.9",341,[158,922,1302,479]]]'>We believe the court erred in excluding this deed. The objection to the acknowledgment was too general, and should not have been entertained by the court, without requiring appellee to specify the particular defect relied upon by him. We have, however, examined the acknowlment, and think it in substantial compliance with the law. A deed purporting to be made by a firm should be acknowledged by one of the members. 1 Dev. on Deeds, sec. 645; Sloan v.

Richardson &amp; Co., 33 Texas, 16, it was held, that proof by a subscribing witness that he saw “ Richardson <em>&amp; </em>Co. sign the same " was sufficient to admit the deed to registration. To this decision, however, Morrill, Chief Justice, dissented, upon the ground that the acknowledgment should have named the member of the firm who signed.</p>
    <p id="b341-11" data-blocks='[["BL_341.11",341,[158,1667,1301,287]]]'>The deed here upon its face showed that Sylvan Blum, who acknowledged the deed, was a member of the firm whose act it purported to be; and if this had not already been shown to be a fact by the deed under which Leon &amp; H. Blum claimed (as to which we are not advised by the statement of facts), the deed should nevertheless have been admitted and appellee allowed to make this proof by other evidence.</p>

We think an inspection of the description of the land, as contained in the deed and copied above, will show it to be more than ordinarily full and definite. We attach no importance to the fact that the number of acres which would seem to be included in the field notes considerably exceeds 1535, the number called <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>for in the body of the deed. The deed would convey all the interest of the makers in the land embraced in the field notes, whether it be more or less than 1535 acres.</p>
