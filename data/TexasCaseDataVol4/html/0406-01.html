The act should not be held to retroact and bar the right to the writ in cases where twelve months and not two years had already expired before the act took effect; that is, to bar all •cases where twelve months had passed before the act took effect. The Legislature has expressed no such intention.</p>

We could not have two rules of construction for the same act. It was certainly not the intention to bar causes twelve months old at the time the law took effect. The new law should be construed, in connection with the old law, to affect existing rights from the time it begins to operate, subsequent rights from the time they arise, but of course not to extend the time limited by the former law.
