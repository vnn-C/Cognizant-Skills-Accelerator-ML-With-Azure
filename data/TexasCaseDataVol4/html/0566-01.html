      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.—The first assignment of error presented in brief of plaintiffs in error is as follows: “ The court erred in giving judgment for Prendergast, Smith &amp; Co. against the said Ada B. McCain, executrix,, etc., and in holding their lien superior to plaintiffs’, because there was no-such pleadings filed by said Prendergast, Smith <em>&amp; </em>Co., setting up a new promise in writing, as would authorize the judgment in their favor against said executrix.”</p>
    <p id="b592-8" data-blocks='[["BL_592.10",592,[254,1429,1320,1084]]]'>Plaintiffs’ petition avers, that Prendergast, Smith &amp; Co. claimed to. have a lien, etc., on the property they seek to foreclose on. Mrs. McCain, executrix, answers and sets up the execution, etc., of the Mrs. Yarbro notes, and the mortgage to secure them, and states the amount due-on them, etc. Prendergast, Smith <em>&amp; </em>Co. answer, and plead the said Mrs. Yarbro notes, and the lien on said land to secure them, fully and correctly, and all other facts necessary to recover judgment on them and to-foreclose their lien on said land against both the executrix and plaintiffs, in error, and pray fully for the relief applicable, and then pray ‘ ‘ for such other and further relief as the nature of the case may require,” etc. Then in reply to plaintiff’s plea of limitation, after demurring, etc., they plead “ that the executrix of said J. H. McCain, deceased, on the 1st day of October. 1889, and previous to the expiration of four years after the maturity-of the notes forming the basis of their claim, endorsed on said notes an acknowledgment of the amount then due upon each, and allowed the same as a just claim against the estate of said deceased, to be paid in due course. And they further aver, that by the terms of the instrument itself, the foreclosure of which is sought by the plaintiffs, of date December 2, 1877, the debt set up by these defendants is recognized and admitted by the debtor, the said J. H. McCain, and it is therein specially provided that the payment of the debt claimed by these defendants should take precedence of the debt set up by plaintiffs.”</p>

Smith, the lien to secure the debt held by Prendergast, Smith &amp; Co. was not barred as to plaintiffs.’ ’ (2) “ The court erred in concluding as matter of law, from the facts found and filed in the record, that under the endorsements made on the Yarbro notes by the executrix, before they were barred, the lien of Prendergast, Smith <em>&amp; </em>Co. was not barred by the statute of limitation as to plaintiffs.”</p>
    <p id="b593-6" data-blocks='[["BL_593.6",593,[162,1532,1304,588]]]'>The mortgage lien of plaintiffs was given subject to the mortgage lien previously given to secure the Yarbro debt; the existence of the Yarbro debt and mortgage to secure it was not merely recited in plaintiffs’ mortgage, but it was therein expressly provided that it should be subject to it. A junior mortgagee, whose mortgage is expressly made subject to a. prior mortgage, can not defeat the prior mortgage lien by showing that it is invalid against the mortgagor, and thereby secure a larger lien than that contracted for. Plaintiffs’ claim upon the land was subordinate to the Yarbro mortgage, and can not be asserted in hostility to it; and the court did not err in so treating it. 1 Jones on Mort., 484, sec. 595; Freeman v.
