On January 3, 1889, by an order of the County Court of Atascosa County, Birmingham was required to file a new bond as such administrator, and on the same day he, as administrator of said estate, with John Chapman, H.

Goins filed their petition in said County Court, praying that Birmingham be required to give a new bond; in which petition they alleged, that his bond was insufficient in amount; that the character of the property had changed since they became his secureties, and that said administrator had removed or was about to remove his property from the State; that he had violated the conditions of his bond, and was incompetent and unfit to attend to the business incident to the estate, and was not conducting the same according to law. Upon this application, the court found that Birmingham’s bond was wholly insufficient in amount to protect and secure the estate, and on September 27, 1890, ordered that he <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>enter into a new bond in the sum of $12,000 within twenty days from that date.</p>

      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.—Before the case was called for trial, appellee entered a discontinuance as to Birmingham. It was alleged and proven, that his residence was unknown, and could not be ascertained by the use of reasonable diligence, and that he was actually and notoriously insolvent. The court instructed the jury, if it was not proven that Birmingham’s, residence was unknown, or that he was actually or notoriously insolvent, judgment could not be rendered against appellants. The statute authorized the discontinuance as to him, but made it obligatory on the appelleeto allege and establish that his residence was unknown and could not be ascertained by the use of reasonable diligence, or that he was actually or notoriously insolvent, before he could obtain judgment against the sureties on his bond. This obligation having been met and discharged, shows that no error was committed in entering such discontinuance. It was immaterial whether he had been cited in the case or not, if the conditions prescribed by statute that authorized judgment against his sureties were performed, the discontinuance was properly entered.</p>

    <p id="b535-7" data-blocks='[["BL_535.7",535,[162,736,1300,935]]]'>The fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth assignments of error call in question the validity of appellee’s appointment as administrator of O’Neill’s estate. The question was raised by a plea of abatement, which was not sworn to. The court permitted the records of the County Court relating to and affecting the appointment to be read in evidence, but refused to hear paroi testimony impugning its validity; and refused to submit the plea to the jury, for the reason that the records of the County Court did not disclose that the appointment of the administrator de bonis non was illegal, and that said court being one of general jurisdiction over the subject matter, its action was final‘and conclusive and not subject to collateral attack. In this we think there was no error. Lyne v. Sanford, 82 Texas, 63; Alexander v. Maverick, 18 Texas, 179; Hurley v. Barnard, 48 Texas, 87; Gilford v. Love, 49 Texas, 715; Williams v. Ball, 52 Texas, 608; Murchison v. White, 54 Texas, 83; Heath v. Layne, 62 Texas, 691. It is only when the record affirmatively discloses that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant the letters of administration that the order making the appointment can be collaterally attacked. Harwood v. Wylie, 70 Texas, 540; Duncan v. Veal, 49 Texas, 604; and Merriweather v. Kennard, 41 Texas, 273, are cases illustrative of this principle.</p>

Dorsey having testified that he was one of the sureties on the note of $4500 given by B. Musgrave to Birmingham as administrator of said estate, and that upon settlement of said note he gave his note for $1800 and had not paid it, appellants then offered to prove by Birmingham’s attorney, that he had said note for $1800 in his possession, that it was payable to Birmingham, as administrator, and had never been paid by him. Upon objection of appellee the testimony was not admitted. The action of the court in rejecting it is assigned as error. The court gave as its reason for excluding the testimony, “that the attorney had testified that he did not remember whether the $1800 note was made payable to Birmingham personally or as administrator; that the evidence offered was immaterial, because Birmingham, as administrator, had no authority to compromise or take other or different notes or security in lieu of the $4500 note given for property which had been sold under an order of court, unless specially authorized by the County Court to change such security, and because the note had not been <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>produced or accounted for or turned over to Birmingham’s successor, and was inaccessible to said administrator.”</p>

Nothing short of paying the original note in full would have discharged it. There was no error in the court’s excluding the testimony. Nor was there error in the court’s refusal to permit appellants to introduce in evidence the accohnt of Oppenheimer against the estate, for the purpose of showing .that an item therein of $378.50 was a credit in favor of the estate. The account had been rejected by the County Court as a claim against the estate, and was not evidence to prove anything.</p>

Birmingham as administrator of O’Neill’s estate, filed in the County Court, were not in and of themselves, in the absence of an order by the County Court approving them, admissible in evidence; and if they had been'tendered without evidence to show the justness and correctness of the items in the accounts as such claims, they would have been properly excluded. But counsel offered witnesses to prove that they were such claims; and the court refused to hear any evidence on the subject, upon the ground that no such claims, credits, or offsets could be admitted or allowed in behalf of appellants, except such as had been allowed by the administrator and approved by the County Court. All that were so allowed and approved were admitted, but those not were excluded; the court giving as a reason for such ruling, “ that the administrator de bonis non had full authority under the statute to settle with his predecessor, and such claims as had not been allowed by the County Court should be presented to him and then to the County Court; and that no claim for expenses or compensation could be legally an offset in this suit, which had not been passed on by the Probate Court, the proper tribunal to adjust such matters in the first instance.” We think the assignment of error to the action of the court in excluding evidence offered to establish said claims in favor of appellants, as. offsets to the liability of Birmingham for misappropriating assets of the estate, is well taken.</p>

It is a principle of natural justness and of the law, that a person who is proceeded against in a court shall have a full and fair opportunity to make his defense. This opportunity to the defendant to be heard is an essential element to jurisdiction; <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>and if the appellants had no right to be heard on an issue, if established in their favor, that would lessen their liability, complete justice could not be done in the ease, which would demonstrate that the court was without authority to hear and determine it.</p>

If the claims sought to be established by appellants against the estate had been proved as just, they would have, pro tanto, diminished appellee’s demand against them; and it was not necessary to have them allowed and approved in the County Court as a prerequisite of their being used as an offset in this case.

But when the loss arising out of misconduct is made up to the estate, so that the beneficiaries get the full benefit of a vigorous and efficient administration, it Is neither just nor logical that a bonus should be granted to them in the shape of commissions denied the administrator, thus increasing the burden which, in such cases, usually falls upon the delinquent sureties. To the extent to which the estate has been properly administered, and on the amounts which he or his sureties pay, or make up for the losses by devastavit or maladministration, the administrator should be allowed such commissions as the statute provides.” 2 Am.
