The purchaser visited the house a few times within a year and a half, and once plowed a fire guard around the land, but lived on other land, where he was employed. <em>Held, </em>that he was not a “ settler in good faith" on the land as required, by section 7 of said act.</p>

He himself, who should best know the character of his occupancy, abstained from testifying. He relied quite exclusively upon the testimony of his vendor, Rippey, to make out his case. The latter’s statement on this subject is as follows: “I know that Frank Bilger lived on this section. He went on the section and stayed about a month. I know that he carried his goods down there and kept them there awhile; that he worked on the section a good deal—some in every month. He worked for me the most of the time, and stayed at my house; was my overseer. He did some plowing and other work on this land, and put up a house 14x16 feet. The plaintiff had a cooking stove and some bedding in the house. * * * I was not in this country more than half of that month that Bilger was on this section. I saw him there only twice during that month. I stated that Bilger lived on the section about a year and a half. I do not know that I saw him there more than five times during the year and a half. He was at my house the most of the time. He kept his bedding and camp outfit in his house on the section for awhile, but some one broke into his house and stole some ■of his goods, and then he brought them away. I don’t know who broke <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>into the house, whether it was Bilger or not. I do not know that any of his goods were stolen. I know that he carried away from my house three pairs of blankets, and only brought back one pair. I do not know what became of the other two. After he brought his goods away from the house he would go down to his section about once a month and would take his camp outfit with him. I do not know whether he went to the •section, or where he went. I know he was not at my house. Sometimes he went once a month, and. sometimes he did not go so often. If he was busy at my place he did not go so often.”</p>

The small house upon the land was during all this time unoccupied; it was without a window, or a chimney or a flue or a place to let out smoke, and its contents consisted of a sack and a piece of timber.</p>

The small house described by these witnesses was not suggestive of occupancy by “civilized man.” Meanwhile, after this abandonment, the evidence further shows, that on November 18, 1889, the defendant Atkeson took possession of the land as an actual settler in good faith; that after such occupancy he improved the property as a home, building a'residence upon it, planting an orchard, •constructing a fence of three miles, and paying all dues as prescribed by the Act of 1887.</p>

Such settlement would be greatly retarded, if in every instance of failure to reside upon and improve by a purchaser, this fact would have to be judicially ascertained by the State, before the land would be open to settlement to a second purchaser, between whom and the former purchaser the issue of failure and abandonment could be fully and fairly determined.
