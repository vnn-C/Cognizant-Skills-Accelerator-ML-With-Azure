Estate of Wife—Her Bight to Purchase on Credit— Notice.—A husband borrowed and used his wife’s separate money, and afterward sold the homestead and turned over the proceeds to her in payment of the ■debt. Afterward, the wife purchased for her separate estate a tract of land, paying part cash out of such separate, means, and for the balance of the purchase money executed notes, which were also signed by the husband. The deed was taken in the wife's name, but it did not disclose that the land was for her separate estate. It was fully understood at the time between the parties that the land was bought for her separate estate, and was to be paid for out of her separate means. Interest payments were made either out of the wife’s separate means, or by the husband in discharge of his debt to her. The land was levied upon afterward under attachment by a creditor of the husband, and in the meantime sold by the wife and husband to W. J. Fogarty. At the sale under attachment it was purchased by John T. Parker, who had written notice before his purchase that the land was bought with the separate means and as the separate estate of the wife.

Fogarty against John T. Parker and John Fogarty, to remove clouds from the title of 500 acres of land. Plaintiff claims that the land was bought by Amanda J. Fogarty, the wife of John Fogarty, from T. W. House; that $1000 of her separate money was paid in cash, and that it was understood and intended by herself and husband that the balance of the purchase money therefor should be paid out of her separate estate, and that notes were given for the deferred payments, in which the husband joined pro forma. The deed waste Amanda J. Fogarty without disclosing that it was her separate estate. That the land was afterwards levied upon under attachment by a creditor of John Fogarty, and in the meantime was sold by Amanda J. Fogarty and husband to plaintiff. The homestead of 200 acres was set apart by the sheriff, and the balance, 300 acres, bought at the foreclosure sale by defendant, John Parker, for $50. That before the purchase Parker was notified that the property was bought as the separate estate of Amanda J. Fogarty, and was her separate property at the time of the levy. The de^ fendant, Parker, denied that the land was ever the separate estate of Amanda J. Fogarty, but claims that the whole, and in any event a part; of the purchase money was paid with community funds, and that the sale-by Amanda and John Fogarty to W. J. Fogarty was fraudulent.</p>

The capital invested in this business was the separate property of the wife; there was but little profit made in the business; that “ <em>he simply took the money out of the business to pay interest.” </em>If he took the money out of the business, it must have been money that he put into the business, which was the separate property of the wife. For the year 1889, the interest was paid out of the proceeds of cotton raised on the farm; and after that it was paid under the direction of W. J. Fogarty, who owned the place.</p>
