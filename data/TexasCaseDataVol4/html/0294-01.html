Suit Within Forty Days.—When a contract of shipment stipulates that no suit shall be sustainable for recovery of any claim for loss or injury to stock shipped, unless brought within forty days, and such stipulation is not shown to be unreasonable, it is an effectual bar to a suit subsequently brought, unless it be shown by the plaintiff that the defendant company has waived it.</p>

Defendant company had the right to limit its liability to its own line, and this case is not distinguishable from McCarn v. Railway, 84 Texas, 352.</p>

This part of the contract was not alleged in the pleading of either party. Whether defendant could avail himself of this part of the contract without having pleaded it, we do not decide, but it has been held that such contracts are valid, and the burden rests upon the plaintiff to clear himself of negligence, and trace the damage to the fault of the carrier.</p>

    <p id="AZr" data-blocks='[["BL_320.6",320,[1017,1490,551,36]],["BL_320.7",320,[264,1539,1304,186]]]'>By the contracts of shipment for damages for breach of which these actions were commenced, appellant undertook to carry the cattle from Sealy, Texas, to Arkansas City, Kansas, which was a station upon the line of the Atchison, Topeka <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Railway, be)rond the terminus of appellant’s road.</p>
    <p id="b320-6" data-blocks='[["BL_320.8",320,[264,1738,1303,277]]]'>The contracts contained the usual stipulations exempting defendant from liability for loss or injury occurring to the stock after it had left its-road. They also contained stipulations that no suits should be sustainable for recovery of any claim by virtue of them unless brought within forty days after the damage occurred. Both of these clauses were set up in the defendant’s answer.</p>
    <p id="b320-7" data-blocks='[["BL_320.9",320,[258,2036,1309,486]],["BL_321.1",321,[151,345,1304,1032]]]'>These suits were brought more than forty days after the damage is-claimed to have occurred, and the clause of the contract last quoted operates as an effectual bar, unless the plaintiff succeeded in showing that defendant or its agent had waived it. The acts of the parties by whom plaintiff claims to have been induced to delay his suits might be held sufficient for this purpose, had there been a sufficient showing of authority in them to make the waiver. It is shown that all of them, except one, were agents of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway, and it is not. claimed that any of them, except one, were in the employment of the defendant, or had any authority to represent it, other than such as resulted <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>from the contract of defendant to ship the cattle to the point of destination, necessitating the use of the line of the Atchison, Topeka <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Company as a connecting carrier, and thus, as plaintiff contends, making that company the agent of defendant to complete the contract. From this fact, it is claimed that authority resulted to the agents of the connecting carrier to waive the provision in question. If the legal effect of the contract were what plaintiff contends for, i. e., to bind defendant absolutely as common carrier to carry the cattle through to Arkansas City, we can not see that any such legal consequence as that asserted would follow. The connecting carrier in such case would be regarded as the agent of the defendant for the purpose of completing the shipment, but not for any other purpose. Its authority to bind defendant would extend only to things done within the scope of such agency. The waiving of a defense would hardly fall within its purview. A liability on defendant’s part might result from default in the connecting line in carrying out defendant’s engagement, but beyond that its admissions and engagements would not affect defendant. But however that may be, the defendant, as we have seen, limited its liability to its own line. This it had the right to do. We can not distinguish the case of McCarn v. Railway, 84 Texas, 352, from this. The connecting line was not therefore the agent of the defendant, even for the purpose of forwarding the shipment.</p>
    <p id="b321-5" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[150,1390,1304,237]]]'>The court erred in admitting in evidence the statement of the plaintiff, that it was the duty of the agents of the Atchison, Topeka <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe road to investigate and settle all claims. If it was their duty to represent defendant in such matters, such duty must have resulted from some relation between the two companies not shown by the evidence.</p>

The extent of his powers as such is not proven otherwise than by the testimony offered by defendant, which shows that he was never entrusted with and did not exercise authority such as that claimed for him. Whether he had ever adjusted and paid such claims, or had waived such conditions as those in question, is not indicated further than this, nor are any circumstances disclosed from which an inference that his acts and statements by which it is sought to bind the defendant were within the scope of his apparent authority.</p>

The plaintiff testified, that the two roads “were connecting lines, and that they were acting together at the time of shipment.” This is too indefinite to establish a partnership or other relation between them, such as to enable the agents of one to bind the other. How they were <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>acting together, whether simply as connecting lines or otherwise, is not shown.</p>

Whether, in view of the fact that plaintiff’s servants were to attend and look after the stock in transit, the burden was ■on him to negative the conclusion that a particular loss occurred through his own negligence, and prove that it resulted from the fault of the carrier; and if so, whether or not, when he offered the contract in evidence, the defendant could avail itself of this provision without having pleaded it, are questions which we do not feel inclined to decide without further argument and more time than we can bestow upon it. We will simply remark, that such limitations are held valid, and in such cases it has been held that the burden rests upon the plaintiff who accompanies and agrees to care for his stock to show how the loss occurred; to clear himself of negligence, and trace the damage to the fault of the carrier. We do not think it necessary to definitely decide these questions. Railway v. Sherwood, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20N.E.%20381" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="31 N.E. 381">31 N. E.
