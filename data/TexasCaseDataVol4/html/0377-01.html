    <p class="headnotes" id="b401-15" data-blocks='[["BL_401.15",401,[151,1988,1303,325]]]'>New Contract—Consideration.—Foley contracted to furnish to Storrie a quantity of cedar wood at §4 a cord at a stipulated place and time. The wood was not furnished, and after the specified time Storrie agreed to pay §3 per cord. Under the new contract wood was delivered, and Storrie refused payment. In suit for the new contract price, it was error in the court to charge that there was no consideration for the new contract. The parties had the right to make a new contract, and having done so, the rights of the parties must be determined according to it.</p>

Working with the force I now have and the price I am now getting, I am simply giving you the wood for nothing, and it would require all summer to complete the contract. If you can stand a raise of $1 per cord, I can pay choppers a little better wages and push the work through; but if you can not, I will be compelled to stop work, as I can not pay choppers wages enough to induce them to stay in the woods this warm weather; and without choppers, of course I can not do anything. I am sorry I am compelled to demand this, but it has got so late in the season that it is almost impossible to get hands unless you can pay them decent wages, and this I can not afford to do at present price. Please let me hear from you as early as possible.”</p>
