    <p id="b669-7" data-blocks='[["BL_669.6",669,[190,995,671,37]]]'>The judgment was for the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b669-8" data-blocks='[["BL_669.7",669,[148,1092,1300,240]]]'>Opinion.—The Act of the Legislature approved April 1, 1887, and the amendments approved April 8, 1889, regulate the sales of public school lands by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and all of his authority to make sales of such lands must be derived from the provisions of those statutes. Laws 20thLeg., 1887, pp. 83-91; Laws 21stLeg., 50-53.</p>
    <p id="b669-9" data-blocks='[["BL_669.8",669,[148,1343,1300,632]]]'>The first section of the first named act expressly declares that all such sales shall be made under its provisions. Section 5 of both acts provides that sales shall be made to actual settlers only. Other provisions are introduced to enforce this rule, and to prevent any evasion of it. In neither of the acts is authority given to sell to any person but an actual settler any lands except such as are specified in the latter part of the twenty-second section of the Act of 1889, which provides, “and all sections or fractions of sections in-all counties organized prior to the 1st day of January, 1875, except El Paso, Pecos, and Presidio Counties, which sections are detached and isolated from other public lands, may be sold to any purchaser, except to a corporation, without actual settlement, at not less than $2 per acre, upon such terms as the Commissioner of the General Land Office may prescribe.”</p>
    <p id="b669-10" data-blocks='[["BL_669.9",669,[149,1988,1299,137]]]'>It is upon this provision that appellant bases his claim that he could lawfully acquire title, by purchase from the State, of the land in controversy, without being a settler.</p>

And for the purposes of this case it may be conceded that the action of the Commissioner in classing and treating it as belonging in the category specified by the statute affords presumptive evidence that its situation is such as to authorize the sale. But against such presumption we have the judgment of the court below, which must stand, unless it is affirmatively shown by <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>the record to be wrong. The statement of facts shows that a map of Orange County, representing the situation of the section with reference to other public lands, was used in evidence in the court below. This map is not in the record, nor presented to us in such manner as to enable us to notice it. Loose documents found among the papers can not be referred to as constituting part of the evidence at the trial. Stephens v. Bowerman, 27 Texas, 18. We are not therefore informed as to what facts the map would show. It is evident that it may have shown that the sec-1 tian in question was not detached and isolated from other public lands. If that fact will sustain the judgment, it must be presumed that it was made to appear by the map. <a href="/citations/?q=18%20S.W.%20217" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="18 S.W. 217">Id.</a></p>
    <p id="b670-5" data-blocks='[["BL_670.5",670,[285,895,1297,286]]]'>The question, therefore, as to the proper construction of the terms used in the statute, in other words, as to what is meant by isolated and detached lands, is not before us. We must assume that this land was clearly outside of the terms of the exception made by the statute, if the court below could properly inquire into that question, and if the fact found authorized the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b670-6" data-blocks='[["BL_670.6",670,[282,1194,1299,329]]]'>But appellant contends, that in this suit between himself and a claimant under an application to buy made subsequent to his own, no inquiry can be made into the validity of the contract made by him with the Commissioner of the General Land Office, acting fdr the State; and that such contract is binding upon every one except the State, and can only be attacked by the State through its proper officers. We can not adopt this view.</p>
    <p id="b670-7" data-blocks='[["BL_670.7",670,[281,1542,1299,485]]]'>As we have seen, the law under which, alone, authority in the Commissioner to make sales can be claimed, carefully excludes the construction that power is intended to be lodged in him to sell to any but actual settlers, unless the land is detached and isolated. - There is no language used to indicate an intent to submit the question solely to his discretion. His power is made to depend on the existence of the fact. He cah not by his decision create facts which do not exist, nor clothe himself with a power which does not arise out of the actually existing conditions. The Legislature conferred such authority as he possesses in this matter, and could properly define its limits. These can not be extended by himself.</p>
    <p id="b670-8" data-blocks='[["BL_670.8",670,[285,2037,1295,431]]]'>The case of Noble v. Magnolia Cattle Company, 69 Texas, 434, referred to by appellant, was one in which the lessee of the land sought to avoid a contract of purchase made by an actual settler, on the ground that the settler had perpetrated a fraud by obtaining the land at a reduced price as “ dry land,” when in fact it was “ watered.” It was held that this, if true, constituted a fraud on the State, which the State alone could take advantage of, and that the contract was valid so long as the State did not avoid it. But there was the power to make the sale unquestionably vested in the officer.</p>
    <p id="b670-9" data-blocks='[["BL_670.9",670,[329,2487,1253,38]],["BL_671.1",671,[164,343,1306,435]]]'>A fraud perpetrated upon an officer of the State, by which he is induced <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>"to do an act which he has the power to do, though a wrong or injury to the State result, can not be avoided by a third party. But an act which an officer has no power to do is binding on no one, and confers no right on him for whose benefit it was performed. This distinction is recognized by all of the authorities. It has been held that a sale by the Commissioner under the Act of 1887 to one not an actual settler in good faith confers mo right upon the purchaser, and is no obstacle to the acquisition of title to the same land by one subsequently entering and complying with the law. Metzler v. Johnson, 1 Texas Civ. App., 137.</p>
    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[164,792,1308,624]]]'>The proposition contended for, it seems to us, is inconsistent with the provisions and the policy of the law under which the Commissioner acted. 'The purpose is-plainly manifested to define by the provisions of the law itself what character of lands may be sold and what classes of persons may purchase. These questions are not left to the discretion of the Commissioner, but are settled by the terms .of the statute. He may sell, as directed by the law, to actual settlers all the lands specified; and may sell to no other class of persons any of them except those which are isolated :and detached. How lands are situated i,s a question of fact, and whether their situation brings them within the terms of the statute is a question ■of law, which the Commissioner must determine in making a sale; but they are questions which may be passed upon by others as well as by that ■officer.</p>
