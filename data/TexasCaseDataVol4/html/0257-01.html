      <em>Conclusions of </em>Fact.—As shown by the evidence, the Beaumont Car-Works was incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas, November 3, 1890, with its domicile at Beaumont, in Jefferson County, Texas. Its object was to establish a manufactory at Beaumont for all kinds of railway cars. The promoters of the enterprise were nonresidents of this State, and the people of Beaumont were desirous of securing the location of such works at Beaumont, and their subscriptions to the enterprise were sought by the promoters. Citizens of Beaumont were among the incorporators. The Beaumont Improvement Company was also a corporation, composed of persons living at Beaumont, chartered June 6, 1890. It owned lands and lots situated in Beaumont, and some of its stockholders were also interested in the Beaumont Car Works. It was agreed between the promoters of the enterprise and the citizens, that the latter should donate land for the building site of the car shops and furnish the right of way for a railway switch from the railway to the works. Propositions were made with respect to raising the money to put the car works in operation, involving subscriptions on the part of the people of Beaumont in the ratio of one on their part to four on the part of the nonresident promoters of the enterprise.</p>
    <p id="b283-8" data-blocks='[["BL_283.8",283,[207,2491,1253,38]],["BL_284.1",284,[266,346,1298,435]]]'>The first proposition to build by stock subscriptions was abandoned, <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>and there was a proposition to raise the means by the execution of bonds to be secured by a deed of trust upon the property of the car works. The Holland Trust Company, of New York, submitted a proposition in writing to the Beaumont Car Works, to act as its trustee in the matter and negotiate the bonds; and after stating the terms of its proposition with respect to the sale of the bonds, etc., it concluded as follows: “The full description of your company’s real estate and an inventory of its personal property should be furnished at once, and the deeds of the former left with us, to be recorded and held in escrow by us.”</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[262,794,1301,484]]]'>When the enterprise was first agreed on, the Beaumont Improvement Company agreed to donate the land for the location of the shops, and pointed out to the Beaumont Car Works the land to be occupied. The car works people went into possession of the land about January 1, 1891, and felled trees and built a small house for an office, tools, etc. Work was suspended for awhile until the bond proposition was agreed on. After it was determined to issue the bonds of Beaumont Car Works, to be secured by a deed of trust to the Holland Trust Company, the deed from the Beaumont Improvement Company to the Beaumont Car Works was executed. It is dated March 13, 1891, and is as follows:</p>

It was delivered to the Holland Trust Company by the Beaumont Improvement Company, to take effect only on condition that the bonds were sold, when it was to be recorded. The deed of trust was executed and was placed also in the hands of the Holland Trust Company.</p>

      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.—The instrument relied on in this case by the appellants as a deed is in form an executed contract, and as such paroi evidence would be inadmissible to destroy the effect and operation thereof, although it is familiar doctrine that the greatest latitude of inquiry will be allowed “as to what consideration really passed between the parties; and the grantee is not estopped by his acknowledgment of payment in any action which he may bring for the recovery of the purchase money or other object, so long as the validity of the. deed as an operative conveyance is not attacked.” 2 Dev. on Deeds, sec. 834. See, also, Railway v. Pfeuffer, 56 Texas, 66. When a deed is left executory by its terms, it may be rescinded for a failure to comply therewith; a familiar instance of the right to rescind a deed being upon default of payment of the purchase money for which a vendor’s lien has been reserved in the deed. The instrument executed by the plaintiff is supported by a valid consideration recited therein—a promise to locate and establish the car works at Beaumont; and paroi evidence is not admissible in a suit to rescind the contract to show that the shops were never in fact established, when no ground for equitable relief arising out of the circumstances attending the execution of the deed are shown. It is shown by the evidence, that the condition that work should commence within ninety days had been complied with. An examination of the case of Gibson v. Fifer, 21 Texas, 260, cited by counsel for appellees, will show that the combined elements of mental weakness, undue influence, and overreaching <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>were disclosed by the evidence, and were held to be quite sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to have the conveyance set aside and the property restored to him. No such facts are shown by the record in this case, and there is nothing shown that would entitle the plaintiff to a rescission of the instrument as a deed.</p>
    <p class="decisiondate" id="b286-9" data-blocks='[["BL_286.1",286,[307,1652,480,36]]]'>Delivered October 5, 1893.</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[267,604,1303,635]]]'>We are of the opinion, however, that the instrument sought to be set aside was an escrow, and not á deed. The evidence shows clearly that it was executed by the plaintiff for the immediate purpose of enabling the defendant to secure the bonds which it proposed to issue and negotiate, and was delivered to the Holland Trust Company by the plaintiff itself upon the condition that it should not take effect if the bonds were not negotiated. By the issue and sale of the bonds money was to be raised to build the car shops and put the concern going, and as the benefit to accrue to plaintiff for the conveyance of the property was to come from the establishment of the car works, it is quite natural that it should desire to protect itself by delivering the instrument as an escrow to the Holland Trust Company. The subsequent record thereof by the trust company did not operate as a delivery.</p>
    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.7",286,[262,1252,1304,288]]]'>It is unnecessary to inquire whether the interven or acquired any rights from the record of the instrument' as an innocent purchaser, because the facts as found show that he had full notice of all the circumstances fixing the character of the instrument, and was also a purchaser pendente lite, and acquired no right to the land prior to the institution of plaintiff’s suit. He took only such title as the defendant had, which was none.</p>
