This suit was filed September 18,1891, for the difference between the contract price and the proceeds of the resale, on the ground that defendant had refused to accept the bacon. Plaintiff alleged, that defendant notified him that he would not receive the bacon, but plaintiff admitted that he ‘1 proposed for defendant to carry out his contract,” notwithstanding such refusal; and it is clear that plaintiff did not elect to treat the refusal as a breach. If the contract was complete, and 25,000 pounds constituted a carload of bacon, as he contended, he had the right, on defendant’s refusal, to rescind or to treat the contract as broken and sue at once for the breach.

In this case-the plaintiff insisted, that by the usage of the trade a carload of bacon meant 25,000 pounds; while the defendant insisted that by usage a carload meant 20,000 pounds. The court, under this state of case, should have submitted, under instructions in conformity with the law as outlined above, the issue of the existence or nonexistence of a usage obtaining among those engaged in the bacon trade at Kansas City, which fixed and determined the quantity of bacon contained in a carload; and if the jury-found that such usage did exist, and that it determined the number of pounds of bacon, by the expression “ a carload of bacon,” to be 25,000, their verdict should have been for the plaintiff, if they further found from the evidence that the plaintiff was able and ready to deliver the bacon free of charge on the cars at Kansas City, at the times mentioned in the-correspondence between the parties, for transmission to Crockett, Texas, on defendant’s account. And on the other hand, if the jury found that by the usage of the trade of that city, a carload of bacon meant 20,000-pounds, the verdict should have been for the defendant; and so, if the jury found that there was no established usage obtaining among those engaged in the bacon trade at Kansas City, by which the number of pounds-contained in a carload was fixed and determined, the verdict should have-been for the defendant. If there be no usage determining the number of pounds of bacon intended by the expression “ a carload,” then the correspondence between the plaintiff and the defendant can not be held to constitute a contract binding between them; because both the proposal to-purchase and the acceptance of the proposal were indefinite as to the quantity of the commodity which was the subject of their negotiations-If the usage fixed the number of pounds to a carload to be 20,000, the plaintiff should not recover, because he tendered for execution a contract different from the one created by the telegrams, and this gave the defendant the privilege of declining to make a purchase on any terms from the plaintiff. The latter not having complied with the terms of defendant’s proposal, he had the right to refuse to treat further with the plaintiff. If, however, a usage exists which fixes the term “a carload” to mean any number of pounds between certain limits, and 25,000 pounds •be within those limits, the plaintiff would be entitled to a recovery, if he was able and ready to deliver the bacon, at the place and at the time and on the terms proposed by him in his correspondence with the defendant.
