Deed of Trust to Secure Preferred Creditors. — A creditor, not named as a beneficiary in a deed of trust to secure certain preferred creditors, attacked the instrument as void, because the debtors, being insolvent, conveyed all their property thereby to a trustee for the benefit of certain preferred creditors, and provided by the instrument for the sale of the goods by the trustee at retail in the regular course of business for an indefinite period of time. The trust was accepted by the trustee and the beneficiaries under it. <em>Held, </em>as it does not appear that the property conveyed exceeded in value the amount of debts intended to be satisfied, or that any of the debts attempted to be secured were fictitious or invalid, appellant, the creditor attacking the instrument, had no possible interest to be affected by the provision as to the terms of sale in the mortgage, which was, at most, but a badge of fraud, and alone does not render the instrument void.</p>

It is admitted that at the time the instrument was executed Steinlein &amp; Co. were largely indebted and insolvent, and that all their property was covered by the conveyance.

It does not appear that any of the debts attempted to be secured by the conveyance were fictitious or invalid for any reason; and the only facts presented for consideration in connection with the recitals in the instrument, which, it is insisted, tend to support the proposition that the instrument is void, are, that Steinlein <em>&amp; Co. </em>were insolvent, and that all their property was embraced in the conveyance. The proposition, that an insolvent debtor may convey all his property to satisfy a preferred creditor, is so well settled that it needs no argument or citation of authority to support its announcement.

In all the cases in our State in which it has been held that similar provisions as to the terms of sale render the mortgage void, these additional facts were made to appear, which we think are necessary to the conclusion reached, namely: that the mortgagor was insolvent; that all his property was conveyed; and that the value of the property conveyed was in excess of the amount of the valid debts intended to be secured. Gallagher v. Goldfrank, 75 Texas, 562; Gregg v. Cleveland, 82 Texas, 187; Puckett v.

Assuming that the 81000 to be paid Sims &amp; Wright was due for attorney fees for services rendered in preparing the mortgage, we see no reason why the debt should not be secured by the conveyance. Steinlein &amp;'Co. had the right to employ counsel for the purpose, and the only questions that could be raised are the bona fides of the debt and the reasonableness of the amount. As to the additional 10 per cent to be paid them in case of litigation, we do not see that a fraudulent intent is necessarily implied. The trustee, in the absence of this provision, would have had the legal right to employ counsel to defend the trust, and to pay for such services out of the trust fund; indeed, it would have been his duty to have done so, and we can not say, as a matter of law, that because the mortgage made provision for it, that it is therefore void. Such provision might have some significance as a circumstance upon an issue of fact as to the fraudulent intent of the morgagor, but it is not in itself a fraud rendering the instrument void.
