Allen, part of the purchase money not being paid. In 1860, Rhine brought suit in Collin County for the unpaid purchase money, and a judgment of foreclosure was awarded him. An order of sale was issued, directed to the sheriff of Grayson County, which was returned for want of time to sell after seizing the land and advertising the same for sale. An alias order of sale was issued and delivered to the sheriff of Grayson County, and the land sold thereunder. A. Rhine became the purchaser, his bid being credited on the judgment, and the sheriff made him a deed. In 1865 A.

Defendants filed exceptions to plaintiff’s plea for subrogation, and plead the statute of limitation of ten and two years as against the judgment. The exceptions were sustained, and upon the trial the court instructed a verdict for appellees, from which an appeal was taken.</p>

In support of this position he quotes various sections of Freeman on Executions.</p>

      <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>It is true, that in section 58 of said work, Mr. Freeman, in speaking of the writ of venditioni exponas, says: “ The venditioni exponas was so frequently issued as to create the impression that it was a writ of authorization as well as of compulsion, and was necessary to enable the officer to proceed with the sale. Such was not the fact. It gave the officer no authority not previously possessed by him. Notwithstanding the return of the fieri facias, he could sell the property levied on as well without as with a venditioni exponas.” This seems to apply more strictly to personal property, as the officer by “levying the writ obtains a right of possession and a special property in the goods seized, which continues after the return day, and authorizes him to sell as effectually as if the original writ remained in full force.”</p>
    <p id="b598-6" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[286,938,1302,534]]]'>But some jurisdictions hold a different doctrine as to real estate. Mr. Freeman, in the same section, says: “A levy upon real estate gives no-special property, and no right of possession to the officer making the levy;, and hence it has been inferred that after the return day of the writ under which the levy was made, he occupies no official or other relation towards such property, and has no power to dispose of it and thereby make effectual the lien created by the levy. Where this view prevails, an exception exists to the general rule, that a venditioni exponas confers no-authority, and it is then necessary, after the return day of an execution, that this writ issue to empower the officer to sell real estate levied upon but not sold, and a sale without such writ is void.”</p>

The alias writ alone conferred authority, if any, to sell, and from that alone the officer could derive authority to sell and pass title to the purchaser. “A sheriff or constable has no authority to act under a writ directed to another sheriff or constable, and if he does so, a sale made by him is void.” 2 Freem. on Ex., sec. 291, and authorities there cited.

The testimony to overcome this presumption was the testimony of witnesses Bledsoe and Head, who testified to having seen the alias order of sale among some papers of a case pending in the District Court of Gray-son County involving the land in controversy, and that it was directed to the sheriff of Collin County. The testimony of these witnesses was positive as to it being the alias in question. This was thirteen years after they had seen it. While their testimony was positive, the alias being lost, and the one they saw not coming from the proper custodjr, and thirteen years having elapsed since they had seen it, we think raises an issue of fact that should have been submitted to the jury for their determination.

The court sustained the exception, to which ruling proper exceptions were taken and the same assigned as error. We think this ruling of the court error. The land was sold under the judgment of foreclosure, and bid in by A. Rhine, the amount of his bid being credited on the order of sale. For about thirteen years Allen, the vendee of Rhine, acquiesced in this sale; no claim during that time was set up by him, nor did he pay the purchase money for the land, and it is probable that these conditions would have thus stood had not others raised the question. But be that as it may, no limitation would run under such circumstances until possession of the land was taken, and there is no pretense of adverse possession in this case sufficient to constitute a bar.</p>
