The court did not err in sustaining the general demurrer to plaintiff’s petition, because this is a suit by appellant against the heirs of S. A. Thompson, deceased, and against the guardian of said minors, to recover a debt claimed to be due from said S. A. Thompson to appellant; and the plaintiff’s petition shows on its face that this suit was instituted within less than one year after the death of said S. A. Thompson, and said petition alleges facts which show that an administration was necessary. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., arts. 1984, 1985, 1994, 1995, 2003; Green v. Rugely, 23 Texas, 539; Ansby v.

A. Thompson, deceased, on an account for indebtedness of the decedent in his lifetime, alleging, that there has never been a permanent administration upon the estate, but that the assets were more than sufficient to pay the debt after taking out all prior claims; that this <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>is the only debt; that there was a temporary administration, and the assets sold and proceeds returned into the Probate Court; that the said funds of the estate had been apportioned by the court among the minors, and the portion of all except Samuel Thompson (who has no guardian) had been paid over to their guardian, L. S. Schutler, but that the portion of Samuel Thompson <em>is </em>still held by the Probate Court. There is no allegation that the claim was ever presented for allowance to the guardian of the minors. It was alleged, that there was no permanent administration upon the decedent’s estate, and none necessary, because this-is the only debt, and the assets had been divided out among the heirs.</p>

    <p id="b262-7" data-blocks='[["BL_262.7",262,[297,1264,1300,339]]]'>Before the enactment of that statute, a creditor holding a valid claim against the estate of a decedent upon which no administration was had and none necessary, could bring suit directly against the heirs and recover personal judgment against them; but not exceeding the amount of such estate received by them. This was considered an exception to the general rule, which required that the creditor should first proceed in the usual way against the estate by administration.</p>
    <p id="b262-8" data-blocks='[["BL_262.8",262,[294,1613,1304,586]]]'>The older decisions were mainly upon that exception, where four years-had elapsed and an administration was barred. But in the case of Patterson v. Allen, 50 Texas, 26, Judge Gould held, that where four years had not elapsed, and where there was only one debt against the estate, arid no necessity for administration, and the heirs had divided the property among themselves, the creditor could bring suit directly against them, and that each heir was liable to the extent of the estate received by him. This doctrine has been so often maintained in our courts since, that it may be considered as settled in this State. Low v. Felton, 84 Texas, 378; Webster v. Willis, 56 Texas, 468; Schmidtke v. Miller, 71 Texas, 103; Campbell v. Henderson, 50 Texas, 601; Mays v. Jones, 62 Texas, 365.</p>
