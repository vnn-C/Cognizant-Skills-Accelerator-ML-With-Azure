It shows that the note sought to be cancelled is only a part of an entire and more comprehensive contract, in which there were certain other undertakings on the part of the company and of citizens of the town of Coleman, the faithful performance of which on the part of the company constituted the consideration for performance on the part of the citizens, and that the entire contract on the part of the company was necessarily the consideration of the note, which is of itself only a part of the undertakings of the citizens of the town. The citizens were to raise, and secure by notes acceptable to the company, a bonus of $20,000, of which the note in suit is a part; they were to secure right of way for the company through the county and the town; depot grounds, sidings in the town, etc;, all free to the company; and the company was to abandon its proposed line four miles south of the town, and build its road to Coleman and on west to an objective point on the Colorado River, which lines were already surveyed. The citizens, including plaintiffs, performed and tendered performance of their part of the contract; defendant built a tap road out from its main line to Coleman, run mixed trains thereto, furnishing imperfect and incomplete accommodations, and built its main road on through the county <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>four miles south of Coleman, on the line it had agreed to abandon, to the injury of contracting citizens, their property, and business in the town. The note is but a part of and is dependent upon the whole contract. The undertakings of the company, not stated in the instrument, are alleged to have been fraudulently made to induce the citizens and plaintiffs to raise the subsidy and to make the note in suit, which undertakings were not performed. These undertakings on the part of the company are not inconsistent with the written instrument; would not change its terms, but would serve to explain what is left incomplete and uncertain.</p>

A strict compliance would be to build a railway to Coleman by the 1st day of September, 1886, whether cars were ever to be run on the road or not. Does <em>a </em>railway mean any railway from any point ? Or does it mean, as the surroundings will show, defendant’s road, its main road from Galveston; fully equipped and in operation to Coleman by the time mentioned ? Proof of the entire contract with the citizens of the town as alleged would answer these queries not inconsistently with the written terms, but in explanation thereof. When read in the light of surrounding circumstances, the real undertakings, indefinitely and partially expressed in the writing, become apparent, and it is seen that the company has not complied with its contract, and is not in a condition to ask payment of the note without defrauding the plaintiffs. The petition stated a good cause of action. Railway v. Jones, 82 Texas, 161; Thomas v. Hammond, 47 Texas, 52; 1 Greenl. on Ev., 284, 285; 2 Willson’s C.

Nor was it error to refuse a requested charge, to the effect that the jury should disregard alleged false representations made by defendant before the written contract sued on was executed. If the company made false representations that it would build the main road to and through the town of Coleman, as alleged and proved, and not on the line running four miles south of the town, as an inducement to the contract as made by the citizens of Coleman and plaintiffs, such facts would be a proper consideration for the jury, as we have before shown, in determining whether defendant could claim payment of the note.

His representations and declarations in procuring the same were part of the res geste. The company could not ask an enforcement of the contract without accepting its-obligations. An agent may make fraudulent representations for his principal, and secure a contract based upon them, and in such case, ordinarily, the principal will be bound if' he accept the benefits of the contract.
