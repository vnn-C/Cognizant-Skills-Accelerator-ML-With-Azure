Variance — Allegation and Proof. — Suit being on a note and. mortgage, it was unnecessary for the plaintiff, in describing the mortgage, to state that it was made subject to a prior mortgage which had- been given to one who was not a party to the suit, and this omission did not constitute such a variance between the allegation and proof as authorized the exclusion of the mortgage as evidence.</p>

      <em>2. </em>Immaterial Error.—It is claimed that the exclusion of the mortgage was immaterial error, as the facts shown by defendants are sufficient to defeat the lien claimed by plaintiff; but some of the facts necessary to establish defendants’ claim to the property were contested, and to require plaintiff to contend against these facts, with his mortgage excluded, was to force him into a one-sided trial in which he must necessarily lose.</p>

    <p id="b70-9" data-blocks='[["BL_70.11",70,[276,1742,1301,537]]]'>Upon the trial, when plaintiff offered his mortgage in evidence, it was objected to by defendants and excluded by the court, upon the ground that there was a variance between it and the allegations in the petition. The mortgage, by its terms, was made subject to a prior one upon the same property in favor of Cranston <em>&amp; </em>Co., and plaintiff, in declaring upon it, omitted any allegation of that provision. This was held to constitute a variance, and such holding is assigned as error. We think the assignment is well taken. The mortgage, so far as its provisions affected the rights of the parties to this action, was sufficiently described. Cranston &amp; Co. were not parties to the suit, and it was not necessary for plaintiff to mention in his pleadings the provisions in their favor.</p>
    <p id="b70-10" data-blocks='[["BL_70.12",70,[276,2290,1299,192]]]'>After his mortgage was excluded plaintiff offered no evidence in support of his rights under it, and it would have been of no avail for him to have done so. He had no hope of an enforcement of such rights without his mortgage before the court and jury.</p>
    <p id="b71-4" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[97,344,1303,429]]]'>
      <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>Notwithstanding this, the defendants were allowed to proceed, and to develop the facts under which they sought to free the property from the operation of the lien asserted by plaintiff, and, under the rulings of the court, succeeded in obtaining a verdict in their favor, establishing their claim to the property. And it is now contended, that inasmuch as the facts thus shown are sufficient to defeat the lien claimed by plaintiff, the ruling of the court in excluding the mortgage was immaterial, and wrought no injury to the plaintiff, and that the judgment should therefore be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b71-5" data-blocks='[["BL_71.5",71,[96,794,1300,586]]]'>It is, perhaps, a sufficient answer to this, to point out that some of the facts necessary to the establishment of defendants’ claim to the property were contested; and to require plaintiff to contend before the jury about these facts, with his mortgage excluded, was to force him, as it were, into a one-sided trial, in which he could not possibly win, but must necessarily lose. For without the mortgage in evidence, no verdict or judgment could have been rendered in his behalf enforcing it, though the controverted facts had been found in his favor; while, if this proceeding be sanctioned, a verdict in favor of his antagonists is to be treated as binding upon him. Thus the error of the court in excluding the mortgage necessarily put him at disadvantages in the trial of the issue before the jury.</p>
    <p id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.6",71,[95,1393,1302,427]]]'>But waiving this view of the case, the appellees, in order to make good their contention that appellant sustained no injury by the ruling in question, must unquestionably assume the burden of showing affirmatively that under no state of facts which appellant could have established under his pleading could he have succeeded in maintaining a right against them under the mortgage; for with that document excluded, appellant was under no obligation to further develop the facts upon which he relied to secure a foreclosure, as none which he could have shown would have availed him.</p>
    <p id="b71-7" data-blocks='[["BL_71.7",71,[95,1840,1300,434]]]'>The facts shown by appellees are as follows: On the 28th day of June, 1889, W. D. Cox bought of D. D. Dawson an undivided one-half interest in all of the property belonging to the office of the Brazos Pilot, a newspaper published at Bryan, giving his notes for the purchase money, and a mortgage on the property purchased to secure them, in which power was given to Dawson, in case of breach of contract on the part of Cox, to take possession of the property and sell it, either at public or private sale. This mortgage, by its terms, embraced only the property then in the office and rooms where the paper was published.</p>
    <p id="b71-8" data-blocks='[["BL_71.8",71,[95,2286,1300,138]]]'>On December 12, 1889, Cox conveyed to defendant, J. H. Admire, one-sixth interest in the property belonging to the publishing company, for which the note sued on was given.</p>

This mortgage has no effect upon this appeal, as <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>it has never been enforced and does not include the property in controversy.</p>
    <p id="b72-3" data-blocks='[["BL_72.4",72,[265,446,1303,240]]]'>About January 1, 1890, Cox, Admire, and Buchanan, the. then owners of the concern, having sold the newspaper printing press and job press which had been in the office at the time of the sale by Dawson to Cox, purchased and placed in the office a new printing press and job press.</p>
    <p id="b72-4" data-blocks='[["BL_72.5",72,[265,696,1303,336]]]'>It is shown that Dawson consented to the sale of the old presses, but there is a conflict of testimony between him and Cox as to the conditions upon which he did so; the former stating that it was agreed that the new presses should take the place of the old under the first mortgage given to Dawson, and become subject to it, and the latter claiming that there was no such agreement, but that Dawson agreed unconditionally to the sale of the old presses.</p>
    <p id="b72-5" data-blocks='[["BL_72.6",72,[264,1044,1303,338]]]'>On May 4, 1890, Cox conveyed to J. H. Admire and A. W.

The recital is of a mortgage of a particular date, and the record of it is referred to for fuller information. That instrument does not confer a lien on the property in controversy. In order to reach that, a verbal agreement is relied on, of which nothing is said in the bill of sale. We think the recital could operate as notice only of the mortgage referred to as it existed, and not of any verbal extension of its scope.</p>
