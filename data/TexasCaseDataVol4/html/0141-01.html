Schute and appellant, Needham, in a Justice Court, from which it was appealed to the County Court. In the latter court a judgment was rendered in favor of appellee for $121.81, from which this appeal is prosecuted.</p>

    <p id="b166-8" data-blocks='[["BL_166.12",166,[294,1416,1305,539]]]'>“Plaintiff alleges, that said defendants, on and about the 28th day of September, 1889, sold to plaintiff 30 head or more of hogs, at $3.81 per head, to be used by plaintiff at his meat market in Hearne, Texas; that said hogs, at the time defendants sold to plaintiff, were diseased with cholera, and immediately after the delivery of said hogs to plaintiff 30 of said hogs died of cholera. That defendants well knew that said hogs were diseased when they sold them to plaintiff. That plaintiff paid them for said hogs at the time of the delivery; and plaintiff sues for $114.30, the value of said hogs, and for $7.50 cost of hauling off said dead hogs, and $50 damages to plaintiff’s business by reason of defendants selling plaintiff diseased hogs.”</p>

He also averred in this plea, that he and Schute were not partners; that Schute had no interest in the hogs sold to Dial, and was in nowise liable for any damages resulting from said sale. Schute was sued in the county of his residence, but made default, however, and judgment went against him. The plea referred to did not charge that Schute was made a party for the fraudulent purpose of conferring jurisdiction on Robertson County; for this reason it was defective, and should not have been sustained, whatever the testimony may have been tending to show such fraudulent purpose.</p>

Appellee testified, that he examined the hogs before he bought them; that they did not appear to be in very good condition; that appellant told him that they did not seem to be doing well in his- pen, and he wanted to get rid of them, but did not tell him that they were diseased; that he purchased them for use in his market; that they were of mixed ages, but the most of them were young hogs; that he wanted young hogs, because they would grow; that he paid an average of S3.81 per head for them. That two of them were found dead the morning after they were delivered, and they continued to die at the rate of from three to five per day, until thirty head had died; that they were diseased with what was generally called, and witness understood to be, cholera, and this disease caused the death of the thirty head.</p>
