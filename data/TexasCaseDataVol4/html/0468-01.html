Éacli of the contracting parties is bound to put into the common business its rolling stock and other property, all to be under the management of the Southern Pacific Company, each one to receive its proportionate share of the net profits. There is a union of services and property and a division of profits. Partnership is a voluntary contract between two or more competent persons to place their money, property, labor, and skill, or some one or all of them, into some lawful enterprise or business, with an understanding that there shall be a community of interest in the loss. Then the case is one of actual partnership. It is not essential that all these ingredients should occur to establish the relation of partners. Berthold v.

The testimony in the record concerning the oar in which Edward Davis was riding at the time is rather unsatisfactory, and alone would not furnish sufficient proof upon which to predicate the verdict in this case, and the jury must have considered the question of the negligence of defendant’s servants or employes, as they should have done under the charge given.</p>

It is also the duty of a railway to use all reasonable care and caution in the employment of careful and competent employes, that is, persons of ordinary skill and experience, who are capable of efficiently discharging the duties which they are directed to perform, so that no unnecessary risk shall be incurred by any of the other servants. However, when a person enters the service of a railway company, he thereby assumes and undertakes all the ordinary risks and hazards incident to that employment, including the negligence of his fellow servants, provided the railway company has taken reasonable care and precaution in selecting careful and competent employes. But should the railway company retain in its service a reckless and incompetent employe, after it has discovered his recklessness or incompetency, and an employe is thereby injured through his negligence, then the company is liable, although the person injured be a fellow servant of the person inflicting the injury.”</p>
    <p id="b499-5" data-blocks='[["BL_499.5",499,[150,1034,1309,388]]]'>The giving of this charge is assigned as error, one reason being, “ because the same instructed the jury that the defendant would be liable'for injury to plaintiff’s son resulting from the ordinary negligence of defendant’s servants, viz., its conductor, <em>Greene, </em>and engineer, Henry, or either of them,, when under the law as it. existed at that time, defendant could only be made liable for the <em>gross </em>negligence or carelessness of its servants, and the court failed to so charge the jury, or to give any instruction as to gross negligence.”</p>

In the case under consideration it is alleged, and there is some proof to sustain it, that the death of Edward Davis was caused through the recklessness and negligence of his fellow servants, who were incompetent, inexperienced, and intemperate, and that the character of these employes was known to the railway company.</p>

The question of the degree of negligence can not be of any importance in the determination of the case.

Should you find for the plaintiff under this charge, then you will assess the damage at such sum as may be calculated from plaintiff’s reasonable expectation of pecuniary aid from his son after arriving at 21 years of age, considering his disposition and ability to contribute to his wants and necessities during the father’s probable duration of life, at the same time taking into consideration the father’s age, occupation, health, and pecuniary condition and probable wants. In estimating the damage, you must exercise a sound discretion, although you may find for a greater or less sum than that formerly furnished by the son to the father, while you may also consider the prospective wants of the father and the probable increasing ability of the son to administer to his necessities; but you must not allow plaintiff anything for the bodily pain and suffering of the son or the mental pain and anguish undergone by the father by the death of the son and the loss of his society.”</p>
    <p id="b500-7" data-blocks='[["BL_500.7",500,[247,1388,1303,634]]]'>Appellant objects to this charge, because there is no evidence to support it, because the measure of damages should have been limited to the son’s probable earnings during his minority, less his expenses, and also because it was a charge upon the weight of evidence, in assuming that deceased had furnished plaintiff sums of money. There is ample evidence to justify the court in submitting the question to the jury, and the charge was not upon the weight of testimony in assuming that deceased had given sums of money, because it was an un con tro verted fact, sworn to by plaintiff. The measure of damages is properly stated by the court in the charge, as the jury are plainly told, among other things, that they must take into consideration the disposition and ability of the son to give to-his father, and this was not to be confined to his minority.

    <p id="b500-8" data-blocks='[["BL_500.8",500,[242,2035,1306,285]]]'>The sixteenth assignment of error complains because the court instructs the jury, that they are the exclusive judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony, and seems to urge that it might lead the jury to believe some of the witnesses unworthy of belief. The charge was eminently correct and proper, and might be given in any- case. It embodies a truism of the law.</p>

The witness Barker testified as to an act <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>•of negligence, at Gonzales, of conductor Greene, while he was a brakeman, and at sometime before the death of young Davis, and that he notified Van Vleck and McQueeny, high officials of the road, of the conduct of the brakeman. It would have been better had the court instructed the jury of the object in the admission of the testimony, confining it to the subject of notice; but appellant does not object on this ground, and it should have asked a charge embodying this idea.</p>
    <p id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[162,692,1301,338]]]'>The objection to Nicely’s testimony as to the competency of the engineer goes to the weight, and not the competency of the evidence, and we do not see that he narrates any specific instance of neglect on the part of the engineer. The declaration set forth in the bill of exceptions, “ I have seen him running a train recklessly and carelessly,” when taken in connection with the rest of this witness’ testimony, shows that he was not speaking of a particular instance, but the whole time he worked with him.</p>

Pickren, a witness for the defense, as to Henry being an experienced engineer with five or six months experience, was on the cross-examination, and in view of what the witness had sworn to, a proper question. The court properly refused to allow witness Van Vleck to testify as to what Davidson, Toonsey, and Pickren told him, it being clearly hearsay of the worst character.</p>
    <p id="b501-7" data-blocks='[["BL_501.7",501,[158,1340,1306,1033]]]'>Defendant introduced Van Vleck, division superintendent, and asked him the question, “Do you know what Thomas Henry’s general reputation was, and how he was generally regarded as to care and competency while running his engine on the road ? If so, what was it?” The engineer Henry was engaged in a class of business with which the general public is not acquainted; even those who, as passengers, are in the habit •of travelling on railroad trains would not and could not become acquainted with the general reputation of the engineers who stood at the throttle, as to their efficiency. Then, would it be proper to address a question to a witness as to the general reputation of one engaged in such class of occupation, without confining it to those engaged in the same or similar business ? We think not. Every one in a community is capable of contributing to the general opinion which makes up general reputation as to truth and veracity, of chastity or violence; and doubtless the opinion of the public generally as to the competency of a doctor or lawyer, as they are brought so closely into contact with the public, might go to show general reputation; but where a man is engaged in an occupation which throws him into contact with a certain class only, inquiry as to his reputation must be confined to that class. We think the question was too general, and the answer given does not show where or how the information was gained.</p>

    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[257,591,1309,986]]]'>The proof was meagre as to the unsuitableness or unsafeness of the car in which deceased was riding. It was not a regular caboose car, with a cupola on top with glass windows all around, and the other ordinary appliances. The charge complained of makes it the duty of the railroad company to absolutely and infallibly furnish a safe and suitable car, and no matter what care and diligence may have been exercised in selecting- or in inspecting the same from time to time, it would still be liable. It is the duty of the master in the first instance to use reasonable care and precaution in the selection of the machinery, tools, and appliances to be used by his servants, and then to exercise reasonable care and diligence in detecting-defects and remedying them. The master is not a-bsolutelj’required to furnish safe and suitable machinery and appliances, but to-exercise reasonable and proper foresight, knowledge, care, and discretion in furnishing the same. This is the highest plane to which human responsibility can be required to ascend. The question of what reasonable-care may be, depends upon the relation of the parties, the business in which they are engaged, and varies according to the exigencies which require vigilance and attention, conforming in amount and degree to the-circumstances under which it is exerted.

In the latter part of the third clause of the charge the jury is-instructed, that “ The law makes it the duty of a railway company to use all reasonable care and precaution in furnishing for the use of its employes safe and suitable cars, well adapted for the purposes for which they are intended to be used, with such appliances as are necessary to the safety of its train men.” This immediately precedes the objectionable charge, and it is insisted by appellee that they be construed together, and we will do so. Taken together, the charge, in effect, instructs the juiy, that the law requires the defendant to use all reasonable care and precaution to furnish safe and suitable cars; therefore, if you find that defendant failed to furnish a safe and suitable car, you will take it for granted that they did not exercise proper care and precaution, and knew, or could have known by ordinary diligence, that the car was unsafe, and you should find for the plaintiff. This is the legitimate construction to-<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>be placed upon the two clauses of the charge, taken together. The minds of the jury are not directed to the question of reasonable care and diligence of defendant in furnishing the car, but rests solely on the question of whether the car was safe or unsafe. This defect in the charge was. brought to the notice of the trial court in the motion for new trial.</p>
