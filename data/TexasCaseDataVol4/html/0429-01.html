The findings of the court below, sustained by the testimony, ascertain this fact. If plaintiff below should not recover upon his title, there must be some sufficient reason for it.</p>
    <p id="b457-6" data-blocks='[["BL_457.6",457,[147,909,1307,128]]]'>Appellants contend that the final judgment of the Supreme Court in the cause of Foster v. Powers is res ad judicata of plaintiff’s title acquired from Mrs. Jones.</p>
    <p id="b457-7" data-blocks='[["BL_457.7",457,[148,1057,1308,783]]]'>Mrs. Jones was not a party to the foreclosure suit of Parker v. Bates; no defense was made by Bates or any one, he having no notice of the suit except that implied by publication of the citation. That suit only adjudicated the right of Parker to foreclose his vendor’s lien note as against Bates. It did not affect the rights of Mrs. Jones. Foster, purchasing the land at sheriff’s sale under that foreclosure, acquired no rights against Mrs. Jones’ superior title. Bates, to whom Parker had sold the land by deed, reserving lien, had, before the foreclosure suit, with Parker’s consent, convej-ed the land back to Jones in settlement of the purchase money due Jones from Parker, for which vendor’s lien was retained in deed of Jones to Parker. Bates becoming paymaster. On December 21, 1877, Jones conveyed the land to T. J. and J. T. Powers, by deed retaining vendor’s lien for the purchase money, 8900, which has never been paid, leaving the title in Jones, which passed to Mrs. Jones by his will upon his death, November 29,1878, and it was still in her at the time Parker sued Bates, October 29, 1879.</p>
    <p id="b457-8" data-blocks='[["BL_457.8",457,[150,1854,1304,633]],["BL_458.1",458,[284,349,1312,785]]]'>Foster’s recovery by final judgment of the Supreme Court on February ■6, 1885, would be only a recovery of their right to the land, which could not be more than a right to pay the owner for it—an equity of redemption. Such recovery was of no more value than the deed of T. J. and J. T. Powers would have been. Mrs. Jones was not a party to that suit, nor was her vendee, Andrews, the plaintiff in this suit. It is true that she took a deed for the land from T. J. and J. T. Powers on December 29,1882, pending the litigation between them and Foster, but she had the real title without that deed, and it did not affect her right under the real title. She was not holding title under the Powers deed, nor under Bates, nor under Parker, by virtue of this deed, but by a superior right to all of them. She was not claiming as vendee through the sale of Parker to Bates, in which sale Parker’s vendor’s lien was retained. Her rights are those of <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>Parker’s vendor under express lien retained in Parker’s deed, rights executed and vested by the deed from Bates to Jones with the consent of' Parker. Had Parker paid for the land and so become the owner, and then sold by executory contract to Bates, who in turn conveyed to her, then Parker’s foreclosure against Bates may have concluded her as to-rights so acquired, whether she was a party to that suit or not, as was decided in the case of Foster v. Powers, 64 Texas, 248. In that case the court so treats the rights of Powers as vendee of Bates’ vendee holding by unsatisfied executory contract from Parker, the true owner, as the facts then appeared. In that case the court went no further back into the rights of the parties than to Parker as the supposed owner, deciding that one purchasing from the vendee without notice, by deed retaining lien, that the purchase money had not been paid, was not a necessary party to his (Parker’s) foreclosure against his immediate vendee, and that the purchaser under the foreclosure could recover the land from one so holding.</p>
    <p id="b458-5" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[286,1146,1313,288]]]'>The court went no further. It did not decide that a vendor holding superior title would be concluded by a foreclosure suit by his vendee ■ against the vendee of the latter. The legitimate scope and effect of Parker’s judgment of foreclosure would be to bind Bates’ vendee, or others under that deraignment, and so it was held that Foster could recover against Powers.</p>
    <p id="b458-6" data-blocks='[["BL_458.6",458,[284,1445,1316,683]]]'>The title of Mrs. Jones now asserted was not dependent upon Bates’ title. It did not come through Bates, or under the transaction between Parker and Bates, and so such title in her could not be affected by that litigation, she not being a party to the suit. When Foster recovered from Powers, they did not have her title. It is a mistake to suppose that her title rests upon the Powers deed to her. It matters not what was adjudicated in the suit of Foster v. Powers, or what the evidence was, the right now set up by Mrs. Jones’ vendee, the plaintiff, was not and could not have been determined, as neither of them was a party to the suit. Giving all the effect to that judgment that it can have, it can not reach the right now asserted, the owners of such right not being parties to it. That judgment may have the effect to cut off her deraignment- - from the title Powers had, but not from the true title that Powers never had, that Bates never had, and that Parker never had.</p>
    <p id="b458-7" data-blocks='[["BL_458.7",458,[284,2141,1302,288]]]'>The action of trespass to try title may be maintained and a recovery of land may be had upon the equitable as well as the legal title. Mrs. Jones’ equitable title was superior to any title ever held by Parker or any parties claiming under him; and whether she had the legal title or not is of no importance. She had the superior, the only real title, and conveyed it to plaintiff.</p>
