Evidence — Public Policy. — In a suit against a railway company for damages for overflow of land occasioned by the erection of an embankment which diverted the natural flow of surface water, and caused it to overflow and damage plaintiff’s land, where it is alleged that defendant huilt said embankment across a branch, and left an insufficient opening in said embankment at the crossing of said branch, it was held error to admit testimony that the defendant, after the overflow, enlarged its trestle and opening through said embankment. Upon principle, as well as public policy, such evidence ought not to be admitted. See opinion for reasons.</p>

The testimony does not properly set out the value of the crops destroyed. He should have given their value at the time of the destruction, and should have been held to this rule in estimating the damages. It is clearly held by our Supreme Court, in Gulf, Colorado <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Railway v. McGowan, 73 Texas, 362, as follows: “The only correct criterion for ascertaining the value of a growing crop at any period of its existence is to prove what that character of crop was worth at or near the place where it was grown, when you are to make proper estimates and allowances from ascertained or ascertainable facts for the contingencies and expenses attending this from cultivation and care.” See, also, Railway v. Helsley, 62 Texas, 596.</p>
    <p id="b581-7" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[144,1488,1306,981]]]'>The charge of the court upon the measure of damages is correctly set out above in the seventh assignment of error. This charge is not correct, and does not properly present the measure of damage for permanent injury to the land, as applied to this case. The charge asked by appellant called the court’s attention to the question. The plaintiff in his petition alleges, that the defendant “injured and damaged plaintiff’s said land permanently in the sum of $2500;” but said petition does not show in what such permanent injury consists, but it may be inferred that it consists in the construction of the embankment with insufficient culverts to allow the water to escape. If the damage to a party’s land should consist in washing away the soil, or in washing away his house, or in leaving such deposits upon the land as to render it unfit for cultivation, or the like, this would be such injury as could be recovered for in an action; but where such damages consist in rendering the land liable to overflow in the future, it is such as may or may not occur, and the liability is such as may or may not be removed by the construction of additional culverts and outlets for the water; so that this character of damage is in its nature uncertain, and can not be recovered until the injury actually occurs; and each separate injury renders the party at fault liable for such injury as may then occur.</p>

      <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>In the case of Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company v. Helsley, 62 Texas, 596, the facts were very similar to the facts in this caes; and Justice Stayton, in commenting upon the charge in that case, says: “ The-charge, however, in reference to the measure of damages was incorrect. The charge was as follows: ‘ If you find for the plaintiff, you will find, for him such a sum of money as the evidence shows he has been damaged, not exceeding the amount of damages alleged. In estimating the damages you find for plaintiff, if any, you will do so by estimating the market value of the land at and just before the time of building the railway and the market value of the same after the injury was done, if any be shown by the evidence to have been done.’ Of this charge we may say, as was said of a similar charge by the Supreme Court of Iowa: ‘ The rule announced by the court is a proper one when the act complained of takes a part of or effects a change in the realty itself which is the subject of the controversy. In this case no part of the land was taken, nor was any change wrought upon it. The only detriment which the land sustains is its liability to overflow from unusually heavy rains. The true measure of damages is the injury which the land and other property of plaintiff sustains from the successive overflows when they occur/ Van Pelt v.

Tate, 63 Texas, 226, the court, in passing upon a similar charge, says: “Neither the charge given nor the evidence offered were such as to enable the jury to ascertain the true amount of damages the appellant would be entitled to recover. The evidence was based on the idea that the facts out of which the injuries grew were to continue, and the land practically taken for the use of the railway company. It went to show the value of the entire tract before the water was thrown upon it, and its value after-wards. The petition sought damages for injuries already received, and sought relief through which the continuance of the causes which had produced the injuries would be prevented; but the charge of the court and the evidence looked to a case in which the causes of injury were to continue.” And that cause was reversed on that ground.</p>
