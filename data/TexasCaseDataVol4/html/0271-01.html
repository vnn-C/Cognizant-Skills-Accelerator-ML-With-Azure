Erroneous Charge — Burden of Proof — Consideration. — The maker of a note having pleaded payment, and set up the circumstances under which the note was given, and its special considerations, it was error to charge,, that the note and trust deed given to secure it were prima facie evidence of an indebtedness by the maker to the payee, and that the burden of proof was upon the maker to prove that there were credits other than those endorsed upon the-note, to which he was entitled, and that the maker could not dispute the consideration stated in the note.</p>

Failure of Consideration.—The consideration of a note, as between the original parties, maybe inquired into, and it may be shown that it has failed, either in whole or in part. The indemnification of Howard against loss by-reason of his advances and suretyship for B. in a suit for land, is a good consideration, although the indemnitee may not have been damnified at the time, but Howard could only recover what he had paid out, and if such sums have been repaid him, then the note has been discharged.</p>

T. Howard, the payee thereof, and A. B. Beutell, substitute trustee, under a deed of trust executed by Branch to B. P. Cooper, as trustee, to secure the payment of said note, in order to enjoin a threatened sale of the land encumbered by the deed of trust, on the ground that the said note had been fully paid off, satisfied, and discharged; also, that it was barred by limitation. Appellant testified, that the note was executed by him, with the deed of trust on the land, in order to indemnify the appellee Howard against loss by reason of his having incurred liability on behalf of one Fred Barnard in and about litigation concerning a tract of land for which Barnard had sued L. <em>&amp; </em>H. Blum and others, which included his liability on an injunction bond in the United States Court at Galveston, and moneys advanced by said Howard to satisfy an execution from the Federal Court, which had been levied on the land. That Howard had taken a conveyance of the land from Barnard, and at sheriff’s sale, to protect himself, but became fearful that Barnard would ultimately lose the land and leave him without security, and threatened, pending litigation, to sell the land for. reimbursement of the moneys expended and to protect himself; and Branch, who was Barnard’s attorney, in order to indemnify Howard against loss, executed the note in question, arid also at the same time executed the deed of trust on land of his own in order to secure it. He further testified, that all of the moneys so advanced by Howard had been refunded to him, and that his obligation on the bond in the litigation had been discharged by a final judgment in the case of Barnard v. Blum, and the payment of all costs therein. His evidence was supported by vouchers and other proof, which showed that all the money advanced by Howard had been refunded to him, and that he was under no further obligation by reason of his suretyship for Barnard. On the other hand, Howard claimed and testified, that the note had nothing to do with his interest in the land sued for by Barnard, and that it was for money due him by Branch Among the payments by Branch was the balance due Howard upon <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>moneys advanced by Mm pending the litigation, amounting to $312.45, which was paid to him by Cooper, who was the agent of the owners for the sale of the Barnard land, at which time Howard conveyed his title to the land to Cooper to enable him to make the sale thereof for the owners. •Other payments by Branch to Howard were shown and allowed as credit on the note, which also appeared to have been credited on the sum advanced by Howard for Barnard’s benefit.</p>
    <p id="AhO" data-blocks='[["BL_297.5",297,[138,693,1304,384]]]'>The court submitted the case to the jury on the following charge: “ The $800 note executed by Branch to Howard, and the deed of trust executed by Branch to secure the payment of said note, are prima facie evidence of an indebtedness by Branch to Howard for the $800 note and interest, subject to the endorsed credits of $240 and $75, of date May 21, 1887, and the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, Branch, to prove that there were other payments and credits which the note is entitled to.

The consideration of a note as between the original parties thereto may be inquired into, and it may be shown that it has failed, either in whole or in part. Evidence was properly admitted which tended to show that the consideration of the note in question was the indemnification of Howard against loss by reason of his advances and suretyship for Barnard in and about Ms suit for the recovery of land.</p>
