      <em>Conclusions of </em>Fact.— 1. The plaintiff, II. L. Kniffen, sued the appellant for the value of certain coal, amounting, as claimed, to the sum of $2333, shipped to and used by appellant between February 26, 1890, and March, 1890. All of the petition was struck out on exception, except the claim for value as above, and those portions upon which exemplary damages were asked in the sum of $10,000. No exception was presented by Kniffen to the action of the court striking out part of his petition as aforesaid; on the contrary, he is asking affirmance of the judgment.</p>

That before shipping to Yoakum the coal sued for, he had a conversation with A. G-. Cooper, the auditor of defendant’s road, and Cooper promised him that if he would bill the coal through to Yoakum, so as to give them the benefit of the through rate of freight, the coal would be left on the side track, and none of it would be used until it was paid for. That when the bank reported the drafts not paid, he went to San Antonio and saw Mr. Cooper about it, who said that the company had not paid the drafts, but had used the coal, and that I would have to see their attorneys about it. That he then went to the company’s attorneys, and was by them informed that the drafts had not been paid because they had a claim on him for about $3000 freight overcharges on coal shipped from November to February. That he then went to Yoakum to look after his coal, but on arriving there found the coal had been nearly all used; saw the agent at Yoakum, and asked him about the coal, and the agent said he did not like to tell tales out of school, but the company has been “ using your coal without paying for it.” He was also informed by another agent that orders had been received from the main office to use the coal. Kniffen also testified, that he told Mr. Yoakum that Mr. Cooper, on February 19, 1890, when Cooper gave his personal assurance that the coal would not be used until paid for, that he would ship all coal thereafter to Yoakum. It was in evidence that B. F. Yoakum was general manager of the road.</p>

The freight was to be, and was, paid by defendant; defendant used the coal, and they considered they had a right to take it as an offset to a claim they had against Kniffen. “ I gave Mr. Kniffen my personal promise that the coal would not be used until paid for. I directed our agent at Yoakum to use the coal as an offset to our claim against Mr.-Kniffen.” The agent at Yoakum testified, that he received this order from the main office, thus identifying Cooper with the main office.</p>

      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.—The court did not err in overruling the exception. The allegation that the act complained of was done unlawfully, wantonly, and maliciously, and with the fraudulent intent to deprive plaintiff of the value of the coal, was sufficient, without alleging the circumstances showing it to have been so done. Cone v. Lewis, 64 Texas, 331; Gross v. Hays, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20S.W.%20523" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="11 S.W. 523">11 S. W. Rep., 523</a>. Nor was any error committed in the charge directing the jury to separate their findings of actual and exemplary damages, “ in order that the amount of either or both may be known.” Taken together with the remainder of the charge, the jury could not have understood that they were expected to find both actual and exemplary damages; and the concluding part of that clause, in quotation marks above, excludes that understanding of it. The interest that, was remitted was a part of the exemplary damages found, and this assignment of error is not well taken.</p>
    <p id="b512-9" data-blocks='[["BL_512.10",512,[263,1985,1303,386]]]'>The appellant contends, that the court “ erred in submitting the question of exemplary damages, and that the verdict for exemplary damages was contrary to the law and the evidence, as the uncontradicted evidence shows that the coal sued for was sold by plaintiff to defendant at a fixed price, and shipped to defendant over its line of road, and the defendant, used the coal without paying therefor, and failing to pay for it because defendant then believed in good faith that it had a legal offset against plaintiff for the value of the coal.”</p>

Having failed to ask such matter submitted, defendant is in no position to have this court consider such matter, or to complain if the jury did not take it into consideration.</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[167,732,1303,190]]]'>These matters disposed of, we" have the remaining question, that of determining whether or not this was a case in which exemplary damages could lie; and if so, the more serious question of whether or not there was evidence upon which a verdict for such damages can legally rest.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[165,933,1304,485]]]'>Exemplary damages will not ordinarily lie in action for breach of contract. This action, according to the pleadings of plaintiff, was for the value of coal converted by the defendant, the title to which remained in plaintiff, thus stating a tort; and it is well settled that such damages lie in suits for the tort known as conversion, in proper cases—that is to say, where the act constituting a conversion has been attended with circumstances of fraud, malice, or wanton disregard of the rights of plaintiff. Cole v. Tucker, 6 Texas, 266; Oliver v. Chapman, 15 Texas, 409; Railway v. Shirley, 54 Texas, 125; Kolb v. Bankhead, 18 Texas, 228; Gordon v. Jones, 27 Texas, 662; Gross v.

    <p id="b513-7" data-blocks='[["BL_513.7",513,[166,1431,1303,684]]]'>The evidence clearly shows, that the coal was shipped to plaintiff’s order, and the defendant not paying the drafts, did not obtain the bills of lading or an order entitling it to the coal. It also clearly appears that the coal was allowed by plaintiff to go upon defendant’s line of railroad to Yoakum, and thereby come into the custody of defendant, upon the promise of one of defendant’s officers, A. G. Cooper, the auditor, that it would not be used by defendant until it was paid for. It seems that the general manager of defendant’s road was present when this promise was made. The evidence also shows clearly that the coal was used by defendant without being paid for. That a conversion of the coal to defendant’s use took place is evident; but to render the defendant liable in damages beyond what was necessary to compensate plaintiff for the value thereof, requires, in addition to the act, that it was done under some or one of the aggravated circumstances above indicated.</p>
    <p id="b513-8" data-blocks='[["BL_513.8",513,[167,2126,1303,385]],["BL_514.2",514,[273,335,1300,790]]]'>What circumstances are shown in the evidence surrounding this act of conversion ? The jury were authorized, from what was before them, to conclude that Kniffen refused to allow his coal to go upon defendant’s line of road and into its hands without first being paid therefor, and that he was induced to relax this position and allow this to be done on the promise of the company’s auditor, that if the coal was shipped through to Yoakum, thereby enabling defendant to save on its freight, the same would not be used until paid for. They further could fairly conclude <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>that this promise was made in the "presence of B. F. Yoakum, the' general manager of the road, and therefore that it was the act of the defendant; and further, that the underlying purpose of defendant in making such promise, and in thus obtaining custody of the coal, was to use it and not pay for it, or at least to delay and harrass plaintiff in the collection of his money by interposing a plea of offset, which the jury ascertained to be unfounded in fact. If the jury took "this view of the case (and it was not inconsistent with the facts), after they had ascertained under a proper charge that the claim for setoff was baseless, we are unable to say that their verdict for exemplary damages was wrong. The circumstances under which defendant obtained the" possession of the coal, and the subsequent appropriation of it, would indicate an act characterized by a wanton disregard of plaintiff’s rights, and a purpose either to defraud plaintiff of his coal or to harrass him in the assertion of his rights thereto; and we understand the decisions in this State as permitting exemplary damages in cases showing these attending circumstances.</p>
