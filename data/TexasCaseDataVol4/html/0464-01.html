Knapp, desiring to borrow money, executed and delivered to J. A. Beddick a general warranty deed to certain lots in San Antonio, their homestead; consideration expressed $2500 cash, and note for $2000, with interest and attorney fees, secured by a vendor’s lien on the lots. Deed was filed for record April 4,1883; note was signed by Beddick and delivered to Frank Knapp, but no part of the $2500 was or intended to be paid by the parties. Frank and Mary E. Knapp endorsed the note to J. A. Martin, and on April 3, 1883, Beddick executed and delivered to H. P. Drought, trustee for Martin, a deed of trust to secure the note. In December, 1883, Frank Knapp died, and Mary E. Knapp paid off the note, and on November 3.1884, Drought executed a release to Beddick, which release was filed for record November 7,1884. On November 3,1884, Beddick by special warranty deed reconveyed unconditionally said lots to Mary E. Knapp; said deed was not filed for record until September 16, 1891; plaintiff had no notice of the execution and delivery of the deed at the time of filing his abstract of judgment, except the possession of Mary E. Knapp. On November 14,1890, L. M. Michael obtained judgment against J. A. Beddick, and on June 29.1891, properly filed an abstract of his judgment in Bexar County, and brought this suit to foreclose his judgment lien on said lots. No consideration passed from Michael to Mrs. Knapp. <em>Held:</em>

      <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>Opinion.—The deed from Frank and Mary E. Knapp to J. A. Reddick, if not absolutely void as between the parties, at most convéyed only the legal title to the property. The equitable title remained in the grantors, and the property continued to be their homestead. The grantee, if the deed had any effect at all as between the parties, was a trustee, holding the legal title in trust for the grantors, who were the real owners. The reconveyance of the property by Reddick simply divested him of the le-. gal title and reinvested it in appellee. Her real interest was not affected by it. She owned the same interest in the property after it was reconveyed that she did before. The appellant, if he had acquired the note wliich was made by Reddick to his grantors, for value, without notice of the purpose for which the deed was made or note executed, could have enforced a vendor’s lien on the land; if he had purchased the land from Reddick for value, without notice, he would have acquired the title; or if the land had been sold under execution against Reddick as his property, a purchaser for value at such sale would have acquired title to it. And in none of these cases would the possession of Knapp and wife, or of the wife after his death, have been notice of their interest in or title to the property, for their possession would have been presumed to be in subordination to their deed to Reddick. Eylar v. Eylar, 60 Texas, 315; Love v. Breedlove, 75 Texas, 649; Hart v. Cooper, 63 Texas, 362; Heidenheimer v. Stewart, 65 Texas, 321.</p>
    <p id="b491-5" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[139,1446,1300,287]]]'>But appellant does not claim the property in any of these ways, but claims that he has a lien on it, and that he is entitled to have it enforced by reason of his having an abstract of a judgment in his favor against Reddick, filed and indexed in accordance with the statute, and that at the time such abstract was filed he had no notice of the reconveyance to appellee, or of the purpose of the original deed to Reddick.</p>
    <p id="b491-6" data-blocks='[["BL_491.6",491,[137,1745,1299,785]],["BL_492.2",492,[290,359,1303,584]]]'>The statute providing for judgment liens only gives the party complying with it a lien on all the real estate of the defendant, * * * and all real estate which he may acquire thereafter, situated in the county where the abstract is filed and recorded. In this case the “ defendant’s interest” never was more, if that, than a mere legal title. He never did have the equitable title or own any interest in the land. It was the property of Knapp and wife when they made him the deed, and it remained their property. Michael has lost nothing nor gained anything. His position lias in no way been changed. If he had purchased the property from Reddick with the knowledge of the facts in the record which he admits, he would have acquired no title as against the appellee; nor would he if the property had been sold under an execution issued on his judgment against Reddick, and he had purchased it with the knowledge of such facts. He knew these facts when he brought this suit, and we can not see how he expects to accomplish through it what he could not attain with such knowledge at execution sale. Nor did he acquire any right by vir<a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>tue of our registration statutes. They do not apply to a ease of this character. In Blankenship v. Douglas, 26 Texas, 225, it is said, that “ a judgment lien on the land of a debtor is subject to every equity against the lands in the hands of the judgment debtor at the time of the rendition of the judgment, and that courts of equity will protect the equitable rights of third persons against the legal lien, and will limit that lien to the actual interest which the judgment debtor has in the estate; and that this kind of equity is beyond the contemplation of registration respecting creditors.” The same principle has been frequently reiterated by our Supreme Court.
