The jurisdiction and powers of Probate Courts under that statute are limited and defined by the statute, and such courts have no authority outside the statute.

The fact that said land certificate was not by said Williams located in Panola County, and the fact that these matters were not specially pleaded by the defendants in avoidance of plaintiffs’ said title in the lower court, is no answer to the fundamental defect in plaintiffs’ title appearing upon the face of the record; because said Williams could not make the contract, illegal in itself, and delegate his authority to some other district or county surveyor to do the work so as to validate a contract already illegal; and because the courts will not lend their aid to the enforcement of disputes growing out of illegal contracts, and contracts made and depending for their existence upon the breach of the statute law of the State; and said Williams would not be allowed to do indirectly, by employing another surveyor, the work that he could not do directly. The court will notice the illegality of contracts ex officio, and allow it to be suggested at any stage of the case and without any plea, and the allowance is not made for the special benefit of the party raising it, but is grounded on general principles of public policy.

K. Williams, was authorized and approved by the Probate Court. This contract was made in 1850, and Wren v. Harris, supra, is directly in point.</p>

Mrs. Hardin and Mrs. Martin, two of the children of Jesse Eussell, are defendants in this suit, and the other defendants, excepting L. Gr. Merrell, are heirs at law of the other two children of Jesse Eussell. L. G-. Merrell claims under Mrs. Hardin, now Mrs. Stone. It was shown that the records of Sabine County were destroyed by fire, and if the evidence referred to was not admissible as proof of circumstances—declarations of interested parties against their interests—tending to show that Mrs. Hill had been appointed guardian by the Probate Court of Sabine County, and that in making the contract for the location of the certificate, and in making the partition of the land asserted by appellants, she acted under authority of <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>said court, still they were competent evidence to be considered by the jury on the issues just named, because they were in the nature of admissions made by some of the parties to the litigation, and by persons under whom other parties to the suit hold.</p>

But the admission of the testimony referred to does not convey or divest title. Appellants having shown that the probate records of Sabine County had been destroyed, had a right to prove by paroi evidence that said records contained the orders which the witness Stone said the children of Jesse Russell admitted to him they did contain; and having the right to prove such facts by paroi testimony, it was equally permissible to prove that prior to the acquisition of title by appellees from the heirs of Jesse Russell, said heirs admitted such facts. This is so because such appellees are privies—all (except Merrell) holding as heirs of the Jesse Russell children—and are not innocent purchasers, and the admissions were made against the interests of the persons making them. And as against Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Hardin, it was, of course, permissible to prove their admissions.</p>

Such facts were circumstances admissible in evidence, to be weighed, with all the other testimony, by the jury. There was such testimony before the jury, but the court’s charge may have prevented them from considering it on the issue above stated.</p>

    <p id="b189-7" data-blocks='[["BL_189.8",189,[154,857,1304,234]]]'>This contention is based upon the fact that Williams, at the time he entered-in to the contract by which he was to locate the certificate for half of the land, was an official surveyor. He did not locate the certificate in the county of which he was the surveyor; but sent it to a friend of his, who was a surveyor, and procured its location in another county.</p>

The fact that Williams was an official surveyor for a given territory ought not to preclude him from making a contract and locating a land certificate in a county or district of which he was not the official surveyor, although his compensation under the contract was greater than the fees allowed by law to official surveyors.
