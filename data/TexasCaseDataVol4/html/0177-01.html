Art. 1387, p. 43, called sess. 22nd Leg. The condition of the bond provided is, “ that appellant shall prosecute his appeal with effect, and shall pay all costs which have accrued in the court below and which may accrue in the Court of Civil Appeals and the Supreme Court (article 1400, page 44, called session Twenty-second Legislature), unless appellant desires to suspend the execution of the judgment, in which case the condition of the bond is prescribed in the succeeding article.</p>
