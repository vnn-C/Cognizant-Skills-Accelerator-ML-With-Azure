Fuller, a man 25 or 26 years old, and married. This sad information he conveyed to his wife, the mother of the deceased, and they talked over the course they would pursue. Mrs. Fuller insisted that the body of their son should be brought to their home at Paris, Texas, for burial, and this was agreed upon. B. F. Fuller telegraphed to T. A. Fuller, another son, at Decatur, Texas, asking him if he could go to Phoenix, Arizona, and received a reply that he could and would start immediately. He then telegraphed to D. L. Murray-to have the body embalmed and await the arrival of his son, T. A. Fuller.</p>

This laudable desire and purpose <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>could not be carried out on account of the delay in the arrival of the corpse, and the fact that it could not longer be kept out of the ground, it being in a state decomposition.</p>

Appellant did not operate its line over the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway. The reason the agent of appellant at El Paso did not transfer the corpse to the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway route, when it was demanded by T. A.

Fuller, in the name of his father, the appellee, to whom the remains were consigned at Paris, Texas. Mrs. Fuller was in no way named in the contract; her relation to the deceased, even her existence, was in no way disclosed to the carrier; therefore her mental anguish and suffering could not have been reasonably in the contemplation of the express company as a probable consequence of a breach of the contract. In suits for damages based upon breach of contract, recovery may be had for such injuries only as may reasonably have been contemplated as a probable result of such breach by the party sought to be charged. That the mental suffering of the wife is not a proper element of damages in cases of this character, when she is not a known party to the contract, and is not disclosed as a beneficiary of it, we think is fully settled by our Supreme Court.

Fuller, the agent of the company executed and delivered a receipt or bill of lading to him, the material part of which is as follows: “ Received of B. F. Fuller corpse, valued at-, addressed to B. F. Fuller, Paris, Texas, which we undertake to forward to the point nearest destination reached by this company, on these conditions, namely: Wells, Fargo &amp; Company shall not be held liable for loss or damages, except as forwarders only within their own line of communication.” The undertaking of the company was to forward ‘ ‘ to the point nearest destination reached by the company. ’ ’ The undisputed evidence is, that the company operated its line to Paris, Texas; therefore, the obligation was identically the same as it would have been had the contract read, “we undertake to forward to the point of destination,” viz., Paris, Texas. There is no language in the contract which fixes the route of shipment. The clause limiting the liability of the company to that of 1 ‘ forwarders only within their own line of communication” was inserted in the contract for an entirety different purpose. It merely limits the liability of the company to injuries occurring on the line operated by it, and does not confine the shipment to its own line. It is a privilege and right of the shipper to route his shipments; if <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>he fails to exercise this right, then the law fixes the right in the carrier, with certain imposed restrictions or limitations. In a contract of shipment which fails in express terms to provide the route, the right of the ' carrier to choose the route is, by force of law, impressed upon and becomes -a part of the contract as effectually as if expressed therein.</p>

In an action to recover damages, plaintiffs offered to prove, in substance, that before signing the bill of lading, that, with the design of effecting insurance, and knowing that it was necessary for the parties to designate a route, the defendant agreed to transport the barley by the inside route, and relying on said agreement, he caused the barley to be insured by that route, and in consequence of the taking of the other route he lost the insurance and suffered the damages claimed.

In contracts of shipment which are silent in their express terms as to the matter of route, as before stated, the carrier has the right to choose the route; but this must be understood with the qualification that this selection must be made with due regard to the rights of the other parties concerned. The carrier must, at its peril, select a usual and reasonably safe and direct route. It can not arbitrarily select a known unsafe route, except at the risk of incurring liability for negligence. Express Co. v. Kountze, <a href="/us/75/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="8 Wall., 342" data-case-ids="3445606" data-case-paths="/us/75/0342-01">8 Wall., 342</a>; Transportation Co. v.

The rule seems to be, that the carrier, in the exercise of this right, must use such care in relation to the shipment as an ordinarily prudent person would use under similar circumstances. The character of the goods shipped, whether perishable or not, the apparent object to be subserved by the shipment, and all the surrounding circumstances throwing light upon the shipment, must be considered by the carrier in the exercise of the right of routing, and if it fails to use that degree of care which an ordinarily prudent person would use under like conditions, it is held responsible for damages proximately resulting from its negligence in the selection of the route. Express companies transport their freight usually upon railways and other public carriers which they do not own or control; and in some instances particular express companies have been cut off from the most direct and expeditious routes by railways refusing them accommodations or discriminating against them in charges. But since the enactment of what is known as the “ equal facility statute” by the Twentieth Legislature, raihvays in Texas are compelled, under heavy penalty, to afford equal facilities to all express companies without discrimination in charges, and express companies have the privilege of transporting their express matter over any and all railway routes in the State. Say les’ Civ. Stats., art. 4255a. With these facilities furnished them for transportation under laws of the State, if an express company, in exercising its right of routing when the shipper has failed to do so, chooses a long or inexpeditious railway route, when there is a direct and speedy line which it may use, and when the circumstances surrounding the shipment indicate that delay will be damaging, it should be held liable for any damage proximately resulting from the additional time consumed in the journey.</p>
