      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.—The county, it seems, had nothing to do with the removal of plaintiff from his office. Nor has the county received from the collector or his sureties any of the money upon which plaintiff’s commission is calculated. We see no reason for holding the county responsible to the treasurer for commissions, unless it were shown that the county received the same, or not receiving the same did some act which was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s commission being lost to him.</p>
    <p id="b556-7" data-blocks='[["BL_556.7",556,[283,1656,1300,434]]]'>The allegation in the petition, that the county commissioners failed and refused to compel the collector to pay over to plaintiff, as county treasurer, said moneys or any part thereof, if true, would not render the county responsible for plaintiff’s commissions, for the treasurer, during all the time he was qualified and was the proper officer to receive these funds, had the right to institute a suit against the collector for that purpose, and it is evident while he had the equal right with the commissioners to institute such proceedings, he could not complain of their failure to do so. McConnell v. Wall, 67 Texas, 323.</p>
    <p id="b556-8" data-blocks='[["BL_556.8",556,[280,2102,1302,438]]]'>It is further alleged by plaintiff, that on September 5, 1888, the County Commissioners Court, by an order entered in its minutes, under an agreement between said court and five of the six sureties on the collector’s bond (the collector and the other surety being then insolvent), accepted the notes of each of said sureties for $500, payable August 27, 1888, with 8 per cent interest per annum, and in consideration thereof agreed to, and did, release each and all of said sureties from any and all further liability in said bond, and by reason of this act the county then and there became liable to plaintiff for his commissions.</p>

      <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>The question arises, whether the legal consequences of such action is as declared by plaintiff. Our statute made it the duty for the collector to pay over these moneys to the treasurer, and it was the treasurer’s right from these moneys to retain his proper commissions. The bond of the collector was conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of his office. The treasurer thus derived his compensation from the moneys required to be paid over to him by the collector, and the collector and his sureties having full knowledge of this condition of things by the laws of the State in force at the time of executing the bond, knew that the conversion of the money by the collector would result in loss to the treasurer in respect to his commission. The commissions did not go to the county, and the county did not have any direct interest in them. They were the property of plaintiff. The defalcation of the sheriff, therefore, considered in connection with the other matters alleged in the petition, had the effect of working an injury to the treasurer.</p>
    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[164,1093,1306,437]]]'>The next question which seems material for us to determine is, whether or not the treasurer, to the extent of his injury, had a right to proceed upon the bond against the collector and his sureties. We believe that he had. While the statute in reference to collector’s bonds does not expressly authorize suit by any person injured, in his own name, for a breach thereof, as it does in the case of sheriffs’ and county clerks’ bonds, still, under the general principles governing official bonds, we are of opinion that suit will lie against an officer on his official bond, by a party who can show that he has suffered damage by a breach thereof.</p>
    <p id="b557-6" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[162,1541,1305,386]]]'>In Murfree on Official Bonds, section 323, it is stated: “ It is usually provided in statutes authorizing official bonds to be required of State, county, or municipal officers, that suits may be brought upon them in the name of the official obligee ‘ upon the relation ’ or ‘ to the use ’ of the party injured by the breach of the bond or interested in its enforcement. Whenever, however, this express provision is omitted in the statute itself, the deficiency is supplied by the construction given to such statutes by the courts, whenever a proper case for such ruling is presented. * *</p>
    <p id="b557-8" data-blocks='[["BL_557.7",557,[163,1939,1303,336]]]'>‘ ‘ The laws which provide for the execution of bonds similar to the one before us do not require them for the purpose of protecting the rights of the State [county] alone. They are also designed to secure the faithful performance of official duties, in the discharge of which individuals and corporations have a deep interest, and therefore they should have the privilege of suing on such bonds for injuries sustained by them through the negligence or malconduct of the officers.</p>
    <p id="b557-9" data-blocks='[["BL_557.8",557,[165,2287,1302,137]]]'>1 ‘ There is no doubt that it is incumbent on the party suing on the bond to show that he has an interest in it before he can recover in a regular trial prosecuted to verdict.”</p>

We can readily see how the facts alleged show damage to <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>plaintiff by reason of the breach of the bond complained of, and a damage peculiar to him, and it seems to us a case which entitles him to an action upon the bond. Of course, there being no law providing that he could bring such suit in his own name, as with sheriffs’, county clerks’, and other bonds, it would have been necessary for him to sue in the name of the county “for his use,” and to the extent only of his injury; and as in other cases, the right to recover against the sureties would be limited to the penalty of the bond.</p>

    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.6",558,[263,740,1299,338]]]'>There was no obligation resting on the county, if in the management of its financial affairs it deemed it inadvisable, to bring suit on the collector’s bond, and the failure to do so would not of itself subject the county to liability for the treasurer’s commissions; and this is clearly so, when the latter himself could have maintained suit for these commissions against the collector and his sureties, so far as his interest was made to appear.</p>
    <p id="b558-6" data-blocks='[["BL_558.7",558,[259,1088,1303,734]]]'>The county, however, might have become liable for these commissions if it had received the money; that is to say, it could probably have been held to account to the plaintiff for his proper percentage on all sums actually collected upon the collector’s bond. But there is no allegation that the county ever received a dollar from that source. In our opinion, the county, in the alleged settlement with the sureties, did not, and could not, affect any right the plaintiff had to recover of the sureties for what damage he had suffered from the breach of the bond. The sureties could not have pleaded the settlement with the county as a defense against such an action bjr plaintiff against them. Plaintiff could not in any event have, under his allegations, a cause of action against the county for more than the percentage on the $2500 in notes taken from the sureties, and he would probably not have this until the county had derived money from the notes; and the commission on the entire amount of these notes was not sufficient to give the District Court jurisdiction.</p>
