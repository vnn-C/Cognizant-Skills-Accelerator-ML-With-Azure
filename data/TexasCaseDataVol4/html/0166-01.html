The exception was overruled, and on trial final judgment was rendered for plaintiff for the penalty. The defendants appealed.</p>

These defendants are receivers, and are therefore not liable for the penalty provided for in said article. Article 4258b, section 7, is only applicable to a railway corporation. The defendants in this case are receivers of the International &amp; Great Northern Railway Company, operating same under directions of the District Court of Smith County, and are therefore not liable for the penalty provided for in said article.</p>

Judgment for the amount sued for was rendered against the appellants in the court below.</p>
    <p class="decisiondate" id="b191-9" data-blocks='[["BL_191.1",191,[200,1600,547,38]]]'>Delivered September 27, 1893.</p>
    <p id="b191-4" data-blocks='[["BL_191.5",191,[149,551,1308,537]]]'>The penalty prescribed by the statute referred to is denounced against and limited to ‘ ‘ railway companies.” The doctrine announced in the ■case of Turner v. Cross and Eddy, 83 Texas, 218, is decisive of this case; and following that case, it must be held, that receivers operating a railway under judicial appointment are not “ railway companies” within the purview of the statute under which it is sought to maintain this action. Furthermore, this being an action to recover a statutory penalty, a stricter rule of construction applies, and unless the language of the statute is broad enough to include railway receivers, they are not liable to its penalties. The statute can not be extended by implication. Schloss v. Railway, 85 Texas, 601.</p>
    <p id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.6",191,[157,1100,1301,138]]]'>Appellee may have a cause of action under the doctrine announced in Railway v.

    <p id="b191-6" data-blocks='[["BL_191.7",191,[155,1249,1302,240]]]'>This case is distinguishable from Clark v. Dyer, 81 Texas, 339. In that case the receivers were appointed by a Federal court, and a Federal statute requires such receivers to operate the railway according to the requirements of the State in which the property may be situated. And ■besides, that was a damage suit, and not an action to recover a penalty.</p>
