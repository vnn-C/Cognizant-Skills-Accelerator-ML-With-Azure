The conductor, in compelling appellee to leave the car, exhibited considerable firmness in the presence of a number of passengers, whose attention was-thereby attracted, but no more than was reasonably necessary to enforce obedience to his requirements, and if appellee was wrongfully on the train, he would not have a cause for action on account of excessive force used by the conductor in expelling him.</p>

Railway, 56 Texas, 239); and we do not think it in conflict with the holding, that where one is going upon a special trip which he has been induced to take by the favorable terms offered by the carrier, who well knows the object intended to be accomplished, the latter should be presumed to know the connections made by the different roads over which it sells the ticket, and the passenger can presume that a reasonable time has been allowed to transact the business in the contemplation of the parties at the time of the sale. If the passenger has actual knowledge when he purchases the ticket that the time allowed is not sufficient, he might perhaps be held bound by his contract as made; but when the carrier places on sale tickets over its own and connecting roads at a reduced rate, for the purpose of inducing a large number of persons to visit a distant place for a specific purpose, we think this, of itself, should be held to be a representation by it that the time named in the ticket is reasonably sufficient for that purpose, and the purchaser can, without further inquiry, act upon such representation.

The agent who sold the ticket says this excursion had been previously advertised by the town lot men, and that he had been instructed by the railway officials to place these tickets on sale at a greatly reduced rate, and he supposed those purchasing them were going to attend this sale. There was no evidence of any other reason for such reduction in the price of tickets, and we have no hesitation in concluding that the purpose of the company in selling these tickets was to enable the purchasers to attend this sale, and to carry out this contract in good faith, it was bound to give them a reasonable time in which to do this. The evidence is undisputed, that a reasonable time was not afforded in this instance; and when the explanation was made to appellant, through its conductor, that appellee had used all possible diligence since the sale to <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>make Ms return trip witliin the time named in his ticket, he should have been allowed to proceed.</p>
    <p id="b120-3" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[279,468,1307,334]]]'>From what we have said, it will be seen that we find no error in the action of the court in permitting appellee to testify that he had no knowledge of the connections made by the different roads over which he was to. pass. Under the circumstances, the acts of the appellant were equivalent to a representation by it that the time allowed was sufficient, and in the absence of actual knowledge by appellee to the contrary, it can not complain that he relied thereon.</p>
    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[279,814,1302,239]]]'>We also think there was no error in admitting evidence to show the publicity that was given to the proposed sale of town lots at Seymour. It was admissible in explanation of the reason appellant had for placing on sale these excursion tickets, and to show its knowledge of appellee’s purpose in purchasing one of them.</p>
    <p id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.6",120,[277,1066,1303,586]]]'>We have no fault to find with appellant’s proposition under its fifth assignment, which is as follows: “ The defendant railway company had a right to eject plaintiff from its car and train without the use of unnecessary force, if he failed or refused to pay fare, or present, when demanded by the conductor, a ticket or other evidence of his right to ride on its train.” We think, however, this principle of law was fairly presented in the charge of the court, and there was, therefore, no error in refusing the special charge requested by appellant. The evidence of appellee’s right to ride on this train consisted of his ticket and explanation to the conductor that the time to which it was limited was too short to enable him to comply therewith, and under the circumstances should have been accepted as sufficient.</p>
    <p id="b120-7" data-blocks='[["BL_120.7",120,[277,1664,1303,335]]]'>We do not think there is anything in the record to raise the issue as to the right of appellee to be furnished with a special train, and there was,, therefore, no error in refusing the second special charge requested by appellant. So far as we can see, no one made any such contention. What we have already said sufficiently indicates our views as to the duty appellee was under to inform himself as to the movements of the trains, and we therefore hold appellant’s seventh assignment not well taken.</p>
    <p id="b120-8" data-blocks='[["BL_120.8",120,[276,2011,1302,436]]]'>The conductor had no higher right to expel appellee from the train on account of the expiration of his ticket than appellant itself had. He was only its representative in the transaction. The conductor had no more right to look to the ticket alone than appellant itself would have had if acting in person. The fourth special charge requested by appellant, in so far as it announced the proposition, that the conductor can in all cases look to the ticket alone in dealing with the passenger, was therefore correctly refused. Railway v. Mackie, 71 Texas, 491; Railway v. Martino, 2 Texas Civ. App., 634; Railway v. Wright, supra.</p>
    <p id="b120-9" data-blocks='[["BL_120.9",120,[281,2459,1296,89]],["BL_121.1",121,[89,349,1304,439]]]'>It seems now to be settled in this State, that a passenger can not be required to pay an additional compensation to induce the carrier to ab<a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>stain from wrongfully expelling him from the car. Carriers, like other persons, are required to comply with their contracts for the original consideration, and can not exact additional pay to induce them to do so. Appellant’s eighth special charge, to the effect that appellee should have paid the additional fare demanded by the conductor, and brought his suit to recover it back, in order to lessen his damages, was therefore correctly refused under the decisions in this State, although both upon principle and authority much could be said in opposition to this view. Railway v. Mackie, Railway v. Martino, and Railway v. Wright, supra.</p>
    <p id="b121-4" data-blocks='[["BL_121.4",121,[91,799,1300,435]]]'>The only objection made to the ticket by the conductor was the expiration of the time to which it was limited. We understand from the statement of facts that the clause requiring it to be presented to the agent at Seymour for signature and stamp had been substantially if not literally complied with. At any rate, it is not claimed that <em>appellee </em>had omitted anything, and if the agent at Seymour failed to sign it exactly as required, it was his fault, and as he was the one designated by appellant to attend to this, it is in no position to complain at his neglect. Railway v. Martino, 2 Texas Civ. App., 634.</p>
    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[92,1246,1301,1230]],["BL_122.1",122,[260,356,1311,1084]]]'>In its seventeenth assignment, appellant complains at the verdict for 8500 as being excessive, and we are of opinion this assignment is well taken. Appellee’s account of his treatment by the conductor, which is the evidence most favorable to him, and upon which this verdict must be sustained, if at all, is as follows: “ I left Seymour on my return on the morning of May 2, 1891, on the first train after the sale was over. We came straight on to Wichita Falls, and then took the first train to Fort Worth, where I arrived the same evening about 5 o’clock. I could not get on to Weatherford that evening. I stayed at the hotel in Fort Worth over night, at a cost of Si.50, and took the first train from there to Weatherford, which was near noon on May 3, 1891. The conductor came for tickets, and I offered him mine. He looked at it, and said he could not take it, as the time had expired. He said there were other like tickets, and he would telegraph for instructions. The next time he came around, he had what purported to be a telegram in his hand, and said if I did not pay my fare he would be obliged to put me off. I told him, that having paid my fare, I did not feel like paying again, and that I had taken the first train from Seymour after the sale, and had complied with my contract. I went forward to Mr. Johns, Dr. Simmons, and Mr. Wells, who had like tickets, and who had received similar notice. When we got to Anneta we were put off. That was twenty miles from Fort Worth, and nine miles from Weatherford. The conductor treated me gentlemanly enough at first, but when I went into the front car, his manner changed. When I went forward to them in the car, I asked them what they were going to do. I had determined before we got to Aledo <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>that I would not pay. I did not tell the conductor that I had my ticket, extended. He asked me to pay my fare or get off. Anneta is a regular-station. He stopped there. He knew that I would not pay. I told him-so. As we approached Anneta, he said if I would not pay he would be: obliged to put me off. At Anneta he stopped the train and put us off. I do not say that he stopped the train only for that purpose. It is a regular station. He told me to get off. I told him I got off under protest; if he intended to force me off, I would get off. He said, ‘ I don’t know what force you want, unless I raise the window and throw you off.’ He also said, if it was a row we wanted, we could get it. I could have paid my fare at the time. I was able. I refused. When I found I had missed the train at Fort Worth, I was disappointed. When the conductor put. me off, he took me by the arm, not hurting me at all, and sort of steered-me. It was the manner I objected to. It mortified me. He had two. assistants with him when he made the talk at Anneta. There was no necessity for his taking hold of me. We showed no disposition to oppose him. His bearing at first was gentlemanly. Afterward it was abrupt and insulting. It was domineering. On the car I would have gotten home in about twenty-five minutes, or half an hour. In a wagon, it took between two and three hours, and the ride was very uncomfortable through the heat and dust. I had a soft, comfortable seat in the car. The wagon cost $2 for the four.”</p>
    <p id="b122-5" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[257,1452,1312,985]]]'>Other witnesses, who seem to have been disinterested, describe the conduct of the conductor as having been polite and gentlemanly throughout, but we believe that the testimony of appellee alone shows that the verdict in this case was too large. It is perfectly clear that the conductor, while mistaken in his rights and duty, acted in entire good faith, and plainly manifested a desire to have the parties leave the train without. requiring him to resort to any force whatever, and it was only in answer to appellee’s demand for force that he used the onl)r petulant expression attributed to him. Under these circumstances, appellee was entitled to compensation only for the damage he had sustained; and while the measure of compensation that should be allowed for mortification thus caused is in the highest degree uncertain, and is therefore peculiarly within the-province of the jury, yet we believe appellee’s own testimony shows that, a much less sum than $500 will fully compensate him for all the injury he suffered. He seems to have been a man of mature age and judgment, at no time becoming unduly excited, and throughout looked upon the occurrence much in the light of a business transaction. In this transaction we have held he was in the right and appellant was in the wrong, and this entitles him to the actual damage he sustained therefrom, but to nothing more.</p>
