Defendant plead generally, that if there was an overcharge, it was not the act of defendant, and that the shipment came under the Interstate Commerce Act of Congress, and it was not therefore liable in this suit. A trial was had, resulting in a verdict for plaintiff, from which an appeal was taken.</p>

Illinois, 118 United States, 557, the facts show, that two shipments were made in Illinois over the same road to New York City. The railroad charged for one shipment 15 cents per 100 pounds, and for the other 25 cents, the freight in both instances being of the same class. In an action brought by one of the consignors against the road for unjust discrimination, under the statute of Illinois, which is similar to the statute of this State on the same subject, the court held, that such were interstate shipmeúts, and did not fall within the regulations prescribed by the laws of Illinois.</p>
    <p id="b637-8" data-blocks='[["BL_637.8",637,[160,1204,1300,1231]]]'>In Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. Sherwood, Thompson <em>&amp; </em>Co., 84 Texas, 125, the railway company received a lot of cotton at Green-ville, Texas, to be by it carried on its lines in Texas and forwarded to Liverpool, England, executing therefor a through bill of lading, though restricting liability to its own line. Said cotton was delivered by said railway company to the West India Pacific Steamship Company, at Galveston, Texas. Suit was instituted against said company for loss. The only question raised in that case that is material is this: Was the shipment interstate or not? Justice Tarlton, in a very elaborate and well considered opinion, held that it was an interstate shipment. In that case stress was laid upon the provision in the bill of lading, that the railway company’s liability should cease upon delivery to a connecting carrier, and that such delivery was made at Galveston, within this State. The shippers contended that these facts constituted a domestic shipment; that as the cotton was not transported out of the State, and the railway’s liability ceased upon delivery to a connecting carrier, it was in no sense a foreign shipment, but came exclusively within the laws of Texas. The court said: “ The track of a railway company may extend beyond the limits of <em>a </em>State, yet if goods be carried by it from one point to another within this State, such carriage constitutes transportation within this State, and such railway is a carrier within this State. But if the railway, whether by itself or by its connecting lines, its agents, transports goods from a point within this State to a point within another State, it is a carrier, not within the State, but within and out of this State into another. In the latter event, it is engaged in interstate commerce.”</p>

    <p id="b638-5" data-blocks='[["BL_638.5",638,[278,501,1299,788]]]'>In the case of Receiver v. Fischl, 1 Texas Civil Appeals, 546, the St. Louis, Arkansas <em>&amp; </em>Texas Railway Company received a lot of flour at St. Louis, Missouri, to be transported to Texas by said line, via the Gulf, Colorado <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Railway Company, to Brenham, at a certain rate. When the flour reached Corsicana, it was delivered to the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railway, which transported it to Brenham. After reaching Brenham, the consignee tendered the amount of freight specified in the bill of lading, and demanded the flour. The road refused to deliver unless a greater rate than that charged in the bill of lading was paid, which the consignee would not pay. After waiting awhile, he sued the company for the penalty prescribed by the statute for detention of freight. The court said: “These facts show that the flour was interstate commerce, and that the défendant company and its connecting line, the said St. Louis, Arkansas &amp; Texas Railway Company, were common carriers engaged in carrying interstate freight, and were answerable to the laws of Congress regulating interstate traffic.’’</p>

This precludes the rights of the States to make any regulations in reference to the same whatever. We do not wish to be understood as holding that the States can not make police regulations relative to interstate commerce, within proper limitations. Justice Gaines, in Railway v. Dwyer, 75 Texas, 572, having under consideration the construction of the State statute prescribing a penalty for the detention of freight by the railroad, as to whether the same infringed the rights of Congress to regulate commerce between the States, decided that such statute was a police regulation, and came within the scope of the State’s authority. But he further said: “A State can make no law regulating the rate of freight for the carriage of goods between that and another State, although the regulation be construed as applying only to so much of the line of transit as lies within its own borders ”</p>

The Congress of the United States, it seems, thought it had jurisdiction of such commerce. Its act entitled “An Act to regulate commerce,” approved in 1887, and its amendments, provide, that after rates have been agreed to and fixed by carriers, they shall publish same and furnish the Interstate Railway Commission with such rates, and after such rates have been thus established and continuing in force, a higher or lower rate can" not be charged than that agreed upon and established, and for the violation of which fine and imprisonment are prescribed.</p>
