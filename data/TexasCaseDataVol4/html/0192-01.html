Under our view of this case, <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>it is not necessary for us to determine the question whether, when a suit is instituted by a writ of sequestration on a claim upon which enough is due to bring it within the jurisdiction of the court, and a part is not due, and the contract upon which the demand is based is made a part of the petition, and shows that the balance is due at time of trial, it is necessary for the plaintiff to amend and allege the maturity of the full amount before he can recover it.

We think this was their obvious intention, and is the proper construction to be given the stipulation referred to; and as the debt, by the terms of the first two contracts, was due when his suit was filed, he could maintain his action and recover the amount due on them. But as the amount due on them would be less than the judgment recovered, we would have to reverse and render the proper judgment on them should we hold that it was not due on the third," and that it was necessary, under the circumstances, for plaintiff to amend his pleadings in order to recover the entire amount evidenced by it.</p>

It has been seen from said agreement, that the property was sold to appellee on a credit; that he agreed to pay a part of the purchase money one month from the date of its execution, and then to execute to appellant his promissory notes secured by a mortgage on the property. The evidence shows indisputably that appellee failed and refused to perform his agreement, or any part of it. The principle is well settled, that when a party purchases goods on a credit, and agrees to execute notes for the purchase money, or execute a mortgage to secure it, his failure and refusal to execute the notes or mortgage at the time agreed upon gives the vendor an immediate right of action for the purchase money.

We do not think that there is any ambiguity in the contract. If appellee deemed there was, he should have indicated it by a special plea, and have alleged the true intention of the parties. He could not prove this under a general denial, which we have seen was his only pleading. However, it seems from the record that he was allowed to introduce paroi evidence to show the intention of the parties, and that the appellant introduced contradictory evidence to show that the construction given by the court to the contract was correct. The appellee had the benefit of all the proof he could have made had his pleadings been sufficient to have admitted it, and we would not disturb the finding of the court on that question, even if it had been raised by proper pleadings.</p>
    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[273,1154,1301,138]]]'>The questions raised by appellee’s third and fifth assignments of error could not properly arise under a general denial, and it is not incumbent upon us to consider them.</p>
    <p id="b222-6" data-blocks='[["BL_222.6",222,[258,1305,1315,336]]]'>The court below found in favor of the appellant for the sum of $1493.75, with interest at 8 per cent on $513.75 and 10 per cent on balance from July 26, 1888. . The judgment rendered is for $1576.65, with interest on $571.98 of said sum at 8 per cent per annum, and with interest • on $1004.67 at the rate of 10 per cent per annum from date of judgment. Appellee assigns as error, that the finding of the court did not support the judgment.</p>

We think this would have been proper if the computation had been correctly made, but it was not. The interest on $513.75 from the 26th of July, 1888, to January 3,1890, which is one year, five months, and seven days, would be $59.02, which added to $513.75 would make $572.77. The interest on $980 at 10 per cent for the same time would be $140.73, which added to the amount upon which computed would make $1120.73; add this amount to $572.77, and we find the sum to be $1693.50, for which amount judgment should have been rendered, with interest on $572.79 thereof at 8 per cent per annum, and with interest on $1120.73 at the rate of 10 per cent per annum; and <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>we here reform the judgment of the court below, and render it in favor of the appellant, G.W. Morgan, against the appellee, W. E. Turner, for $1693.50, with interest from the 3d day of January, 1890, on $572.77 thereof at the rate of 8 per cent per annum, and with interest on 81120.73, the balance, from said date at 10 per cent per annum, with a foreclosure of his lien as decreed in the District Court against the property described in its judgment, as it is here reformed.</p>
