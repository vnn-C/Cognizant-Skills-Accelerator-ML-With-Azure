That plaintiff at once went hurriedly toward the postoifice, which was not more than fifty yards from said train,, for the purpose of making inquiry for important letters which he was expecting to find there; that before plaintiff had gone more than half-way to the postoifice the train was started, and plaintiff returned hurriedly to it, and arrived on the platform of the depot close to and opposite the middle of the rear coach of the train in less than one minute from the time the said train had stopped, and as the train passed him he took hold of the guard on the rear platform of the rear coach with his hand and attempted, in a prudent and cautious manner, to board the train; that just as he took hold of the guard the engineer pulled open the throttle valve and jerked the train with such force that it threw plaintiff on his right side on a tie between the rails of the track in rear of the coach, breaking and depressing in his chest the anterior one-third of four of his right ribs, producing an exterior bruise covering a space of seven by nine inches, from the fractured ribs on the right side to the cardiac end on the stomach,, and injuring the anterior wall of the stomach, and producing hernia or rupture at or near the stomach, and producing intense pain and suffering, which has continued up to this time without much intermission; that he has been unable to labor since he received said injuries, and has been confined to his bed in consequence thereof much of the time since he received them, and has sustained damages in consequence of said injuries, inflicted as aforesaid, by the gross misrepresentation of the agent of the said Missouri Pacific Railway Company and the gross carelessness and reckless conduct as aforesaid of the agent of said railway company, to the amount of 110,000.”</p>
