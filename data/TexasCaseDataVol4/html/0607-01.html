Section 17 of the Bill of Rights uses the word property in its broadest and fullest sense, and is intended to provide an adequate compensation for everything of value that may be taken, damaged, or destroyed for or applied to a public use. Plaintiff had and owned a valuable property right, which was capable of bargain and sale, and the value of which was such as could be computed. Defendant forcibly took and destroyed this valuable right for a public use, without adequate compensation being made; and under our Constitution plaintiff is entitled to such compensation; and the lower court erred in instructing the jury to return a verdict for defendant, thus denying plaintiff this adequate compensation for this valuable property right so unlawfully taken and destroyed by defendant.

The appellant never acquired any interest in the land, but merely had a bond for title, which gave him the right to purchase at some future time by the payment of the purchase money.

Under the circumstances, it would have been possible for the defendant to have instituted proceedings against the appellant, but had an award been made in his favor, he could have collected the money and walked off without ever complying with the contract with Crane and Ramsejr, and defendant would have secured nothing by the proceedings.</p>

Whether the suit be by the railway company condemning, or by the land owner to recover the value of his interest in the right of way, damages are to be assessed with reference to the value of such interest at the time of the assessment, and not at the time the railway was constructed. This, to our sorrow, was held by this court in the case of Railway v. Litsey, Tyler Term, 1890, and has since been held by the Supreme Court in Railway v. Cave, Galveston Term, 1891. At the time this suit was instituted, and at the time of the trial, plaintiff had never paid a cent to Crane and Ramsey, and the time at which he had the right to make the payment and acquire an interest in the land had expired, and hence at the time of the trial the appellant had no interest in the land upon which anything of value could be assessed.</p>

It appears that appellant furnished to Crane and Ramsey the information which led to the purchase of this land, and that the purchase was made, as indicated by this instrument, for the joint, benefit of the three. Ramsey and Crane declined to make a conveyance of the right of way to the railway company, on account of the interest of appellant in the land; but agreed to take $125 as their proportion of the damage incident to the taking of the land by the railway company, provided it would institute condemnation proceedings against them, which was accordingly done in the spring of 1887, resulting in the assessment of $125 as the damages to Crane and Ramsey’s interest only in the land.</p>

It also appears, that while the damage was done before the time specified in the obligation for the first payment to be made had arrived, he had not at the institution of this suit, which was after that time, made any paj^ment, as provided in said instrument; but no advantage seems to have been taken by Crane and Ramsey of this default, and it seems that they were still willing to execute a deed, as therein provided, upon his complying with the terms of the instrument. Appellant was not made a party to-the condemnation proceedings, but met the commissioners appointed to-assess the damages, and informed them of his interest in the land and that he claimed damages. We are of opinion that there was error in instructing the jury, under this state facts, to return a verdict against appellant.</p>

The better course, however, would seem to be to make both the vendor and vendee parties, and then the compensation can be paid to the one or the other, or apportioned between them, as may seem just to the court.” The following authorities cited in the note have been examined, and seem to-sustain the text: Railway v.

It would also seem that in this State, where an express trust may be shown by paroi, appellant’s interest in the land did not depend alone upon the written obligation to convey the legal title upon his making the specified payments, but that from the date <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>of the deed previously made to Crane and Eamsey, they held in trust for him the legal title to an undivided one-third interest, subject to his compliance with the terms of the joint purchase.
