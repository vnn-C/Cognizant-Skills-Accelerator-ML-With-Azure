The evidence of appellee made out his case, and the verdict is sustained thereby, both as to negligence and as to the amount of the recovery. He was before the court and jury, and while there were many other witnesses, testifying by deposition, whose statements tended very strongly to show that the accident did not occur on the crossing, and that appellee was drunk or asleep, or both, when the accident occurred, the jury deemed his testimony worthy of belief, and their verdict has been approved by the judge presiding. He was corroborated by some other witnesses, though we think their testimony did not greatly strengthen the case. After a careful reading of the statement of facts, we have come to the conclusion that we would not be warranted in disturbing the verdict.</p>

The correctness of the decisions in those cases is not questioned, but, as applied to the fagts of this case, the language therein employed to emphasize the principle that negligence is an issue of fact is believed to be too broad, and in quoting it the writer was probably guilty of promulgating a mere dictum.
