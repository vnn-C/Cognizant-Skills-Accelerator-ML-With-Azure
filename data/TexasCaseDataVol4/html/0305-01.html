The facts herein do not disclose whether Brown was a resident of Johnson or of Parker County when this instrument was deposited in Johnson County. The evidence on the trial below was not developed with reference to a solution of this question of fact. The case was, on the contrary, disposed of on what we adjudge to be an erroneous theory. For these reasons, we are not disposed to apply the presumption of fact that Brown’s residence having been shown to be in Johnson <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>County when the mortgage was executed, must be held to have there continued. 2 Whart. on Ev., sec. 1285.
