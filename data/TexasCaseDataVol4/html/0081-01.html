Jurisdiction of Amount Pleaded in Beconvention— Practice on Appeal.—Where defendants in the County Court plead in reconvention an amount beyond the jurisdiction of the court, they can not, on appeal, avail themselves of errors of the trial court in the admission and rejection of evidence, and in charges given, relating to such plea.</p>

    <p id="b106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_106.6",106,[273,499,1305,786]]]'>Several errors are presented by appellants relating to the action of the-court in the admission and rejection of evidence, and to charges given the jury having relation to their plea in reconvention; but inasmuch as the County Court clearly had no jurisdiction of the amount in controversy as claimed in said plea, we are of opinion that no error committed by it in reference thereto can avail appellants, and the case must be considered alone with reference to the petition of appellee and the general denial filed by appellants. When so considered, appellants assign as-error the action of the court below in overruling their special exception to some of the items in the account for $197.95 filed by appellee; but inasmuch as the evidence was undisputed that appellee served appellants-one month at an agreed price of $40, and six months, lacking three days, at an agreed price of $50 per month, and that appellee sold to appellants-a wagon at an agreed price of $65, and only recovered judgment for a sum considerably less than that thus shown to be due him, the ruling of' the court so complained of can not be material, even though erroneous.</p>
