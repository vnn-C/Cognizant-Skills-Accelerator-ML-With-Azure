      <em>Conclusions of </em>Fact.—On the night of November 2, 1888, at 8:30 p. m., one of defendants’ passenger trains, consisting of an engine, a baggage car, and two passenger coaches, came into Cleburne from Paris, Texas. Some slight repairs were needed about the ‘ ‘ Miller drawhead ’ ’ on the baggage car attached to this train. The train was consequently switched on to a spur track, and the engine was detached. The baggage car was separated from the two passenger coaches, about eight feet intervening. The air brakes connected with each car were set, and the cars thus detached were left stationary on the spur track.</p>
    <p id="b383-7" data-blocks='[["BL_383.9",383,[165,1185,1305,438]]]'>At the bidding of one C. L. Renfro, with whom appellee was working, and who was doing the mechanical labor in making the repairs, appellee, in holding certain chains, which otherwise would have obstructed Renfro, and in holding a light to assist Renfro in making the repairs, assumed a position which placed his body in front of the drawhead of the baggage car, with the two passenger coaches at his back. In this position the detached coaches moved upon him, striking him in the back, and thus crushing him between the drawheads of the coaches, causing his serious injury.</p>
    <p id="b383-8" data-blocks='[["BL_383.10",383,[167,1635,1306,476]]]'>The plaintiff was inexperienced in this business of night car inspector, as defendant knew. It was dangerous to work between coaches held by air brakes, as defendant also knew, though plaintiff did not. Printed rules and regulations of the company prescribed that air brakes must not be depended upon to hold cars left at stations, and these rules, as interpreted by appellant’s agents and witnesses, required that the plaintiff, or C. L. Renfro, should, in the discharge of their duties, have applied hand brakes to the detached coaches. Had these hand brakes been properly applied, or had the wheels of the detached coaches been properly blocked, the accident would not have occurred.</p>

He had applied to C. M. Baker, foreman of the company’s round house and yards, who had, on the 15th of October, 1888, employed him in this service as night inspector, for a copy of these rules and regulations. This application he made as many as three times during the course of his employment, the last application having been made only a few nights before the injury was inflicted on him. Baker had failed to furnish him the rules. Had the defendant furnished the <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>plaintiff with its rules and regulations he would not have gone between these coaches held apart by air brakes alone, and would consequently have avoided the injuries.</p>

      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.—The foregoing facts with reference to the experience of the plaintiff, and of the refusal of Baker to furnish him with the rules and regulations of the company, were strenuously contested by the witnesses of the appellant in the court below. These facts were, however, sworn to by the appellant, and the verdict of the jury importing that they believed him, we feel constrained to adopt their evident, conclusions.</p>

They complain alike of the verdict of the jury as contrary to the law and to the evidence. They assert the contention, that under the evidence, Renfro and the plaintiff were fellow servants, as were also the switchmen who left the two passenger coaches on the track; that the injuries inflicted upon appellee were due to the negligence of himself, or of his fellow servant Renfro, or the switchmen, in failing to use hand brakes in fastening the detached coaches, and in relying exclusively, in violation of appellant’s rules, upon air brakes for the purpose of holding these coaches.</p>
    <p id="b384-7" data-blocks='[["BL_384.7",384,[261,1441,1307,733]]]'>Appellee’s petition contains, in effect, two counts: (1) That the injury inflicted upon him was due to the negligence of the defendant company in failing to supply the detached coaches with sufficient air brakes. (2) That if the air brakes were in fact sufficient, and if the movement of the detached coaches was due to the failure of the switchmen and the plaintiff himself and his co-employe Renfro, to set the hand brakes or block the wheels, it being unsafe to depend on air brakes to hold the coaches, yet plaintiff is not chargeable with such negligence, and the defendant is nevertheless responsible to him, because he was inexperienced in the duties of night car inspector, and because of his ignorance of the rules of the defendant company with reference to the discharge of liis. duties, and because of the failure of defendant’s foreman, Baker, to furnish him with these rules, as stated in the conclusions of fact above set out. In conformity with this second count, and with the evidence sustaining the allegations thereof, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>

    <p id="b385-7" data-blocks='[["BL_385.7",385,[151,1392,1304,781]]]'>In the nineteenth assignment of error, complaint is made, that the court erred in submitting in its charge to the jury the question as to whether or not the air brakes attached to the car causing the injury were defective. It is contended, that there was no evidence that the air brakes were in any respect defective. The evidence bearing upon this issue was, in our opinion, extremely meager. There were, however, circumstances indicating that the air brakes were defective. These circumstances consist mainly in the fact that they were not sufficient to hold the detached cars, though the latter were on ground apparently level, or nearly so, and that the air brake holding the ,baggage car on which the work was being done was sufficient to keep it stationary. While the evidence on this issue preponderated, in our opinion, in favor of appellant, we are unable to say that the testimony in behalf of appellee was so scant as to justify the court in failing to submit the issue. We are confirmed in our view as to the correctness of this conclusion from the failure of the appellant to complain of the verdict on this ground.</p>

We think it established by the foregoing authorities, that the mere fact that the car moved was no evidence that its movement was caused by any defect or any negligence of the defendant. Unless the mere happening of an accident is sufficient evidence of the existence of a defect, which assumption is opposed to all the authorities cited, there was no evidence before the jury in this case that there was any defect in the air brake. The Supreme Court has repeatedly decided, that a charge of this character, making the liability of the employer depend solely on the existence of a defect, regardless of the question whether or not the employer had used reasonable and ordinary diligence to discover and guard against the defect, is erroneous.

    <p id="b387-6" data-blocks='[["BL_387.8",387,[142,1592,1307,783]]]'>1 ‘ In the nineteenth assignment of error complaint is made that the court erred in submitting in its charge to the jury the question as to whether or not the air brakes attached to the car causing the injury were defective. It is contended, that there was no evidence that the air brakes were in any respect defective. The evidence bearing upon this issue was, in our opinion, extremely meager. There were, however, circumstances indicating that the air brakes were defective. These circumstances consist mainly in the fact that they were not sufficient to hold the detached cars, though the latter were on ground apparently level, or nearly so, and that the air brake holding the baggage car on which the work was being done was sufficient to keep it stationary. While the evidence on this issue preponderated, in our opinion, in favor of appellant, we are unable to say that the testimony in behalf of appellee was so scant as to justify the court in failing to submit the issue. We are confirmed in our view as to the correctness of this conclusion from the failure of the appellant to complain of the verdict on this ground.”</p>
    <p id="b387-7" data-blocks='[["BL_387.9",387,[189,2388,494,29]]]'>In this connection we state:</p>
    <p id="b387-8" data-blocks='[["BL_387.10",387,[148,2436,1303,89]],["BL_388.1",388,[279,351,1302,188]]]'>1. As we read the record, appellant failed, in any manner sufficient to challenge the attention of this court, to complain of the verdict on <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>the ground that there was <em>no </em>evidence that the air brakes in question were defective. No proposition embracing this ground, either formally or substantially, is set out either in its motion for a new trial or in its assignments of error.</p>
    <p id="b388-5" data-blocks='[["BL_388.5",388,[277,550,1305,486]]]'>In its twenty-fourth assignment of error, which embodied its twelfth ground for a new trial, among a number of other propositions, referring, in some instances, to different and distinct issues, appellant alleges, that ‘1 the evidence shows by a great preponderance thereof1 that * * *~ the air brakes were not defective.” There is a palpable difference between the proposition that the evidence preponderates on a given issue, and the proposition that there is <em>no </em>evidence on that issue. Indeed, the-proposition that the evidence greatly preponderated in favor of a sufficiency of the air brakes includes the idea that there was evidence, though meager, showing them to be defective.</p>
    <p id="b388-6" data-blocks='[["BL_388.6",388,[275,1049,1305,585]]]'>This twenty-fourth assignment of error is grouped in appellant’s brief with the twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-fifth assignments of error, and thus grouped, each containing in itself propositions, sometimes cognate and sometimes otherwise, they are submitted as in themselves propositions to be considered by the appellate court. This method of inviting a revision of questions involved is so violative of rule 29 of our Supreme Court with reference to the proper preparation of briefs, that we would probably have merited pardon had we overlooked a complaint so confusedly urged by appellant on the ground referred to. Besides, the action of appellant in itself requesting (as it did in its third special instruction) the submission of this issue of defective air brakes, would tend to cause us to overlook such a complaint, if indeed it had been made.</p>
    <p id="b388-7" data-blocks='[["BL_388.7",388,[270,1646,1306,636]]]'>2. We adhere to our former conclusion, that there was evidence, circumstantial in character, to the effect that the air brakes in question were defective. If there be evidence, though meager, tending to support an issue of fact, it is improper for the court to withdraw this issue from the jury. Parker v. Chancellor, 78 Texas, 528; Railway v. Robertson, 82 Texas, 661; Fitzgerald v. Hart, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20S.W.%20369" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="17 S.W. 369">17 S. W. Rep., 369</a>. It would probably have been the duty of the court to set aside the verdict had it been rendered on this issue against the great preponderance of the evidence. As indicated, however, in our original opinion, the verdict of the jury was, as we think, founded, not upon the issue of the defective air brakes, but upon the issue of inexperience on the part of the plaintiff, and of the failure of appellant to provide him with proper rules and regulations, as set forth in the second count of his petition.</p>
    <p id="b388-8" data-blocks='[["BL_388.8",388,[271,2294,1305,188]]]'>3. If we bé mistaken in the conclusion that there was evidence tending to show defects in the air brakes, an inspection of the record leads us to think that appellant’s proposition asserting the contrary did not, in the first instance, merit consideration from us. This proposition is as follows;</p>
    <p id="b389-3" data-blocks='[["BL_389.3",389,[128,345,1304,235]]]'>
      <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>“ There was no evidence before the jury that the air brakes were in any respect defective. It is a reversible error for the court to charge upon an issue in support of which there is no evidence, as it creates in the minds of the jury an impression that in the opinion of the court there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding upon such issue.”</p>
    <p id="b389-4" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[131,591,1303,986]]]'>The proposition is submitted under appellant’s nineteenth assignment, asserting'error in the first paragraph of the court’s charge. This assignment is copied in the brief only <em>in part. </em>It contains, as shown by the record, not by the <em>brief, </em>four specifications of error in regard to the charge to which it refers. The specifications relate exclusively to the character of the plaintiff <em>as inspector, </em>and to his duties as such. They do not even remotely refer to the issue of defective air brakes. To have entitled the appellant to a review by us of the proposition referred to, it should have embodied or covered the proposition, substantially at least, in an appropriate assignment of error, and have copied this assignment in its brief. Such action on the part of an appellant is suggested and required by that spirit of fairness to the adverse litigant which evidently caused the adoption of article 1037 of our Revised Statutes, on the subject of assignments of error, and of rules 24 and 29 of our Supreme Court with reference to the submission of causes in the appellate courts. We do not think that it comports with this spirit of fairness that a litigant should be heard to complain in the appellate court of an error in a charge of the trial court, not fundamental in character, which it has wholly failed to include in an appropriate assignment of error. We are of opinion that the remaining grounds of the motion do not require comment.</p>
