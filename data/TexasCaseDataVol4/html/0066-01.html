In February following, at a regular term of the District Court, upon the motion of Glower, Harris &amp; Co., judgment and lien creditors who had intervened in the suit, the receivership was by order of the court continued in force. About the same time, the First National Bank of Vernon filed its plea of intervention, also praying for the continuance of the receivership. In June following, D. A. Turner and others intervened.</p>

      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.— 1. The first assignment, that there was error in overruling the general exception of appellant to the pleadings of the other parties, can not be sustained. If any one of these pleas was good for any purpose, which must be admitted, the general demurrer was properly overruled. 79 Texas, 543; 15 L. R. A., (Ga.), 637. Besides, the assignment is very general, and no proposition is submitted under it.</p>
    <p id="b93-5" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[123,648,1303,877]]]'>2. The second and third assignments complain of the court’s conclusions, (1) that the appointment of a receiver at the instance of a simple contract creditor of an insolvent corporation was authorized by the third subdivision of article 1461 of the Revised Statutes; (2) that if there was error in such appointment, the same was cured by the subsequent confirmation of the appointment at the instance of Glower, Harris &amp; Co., who were judgment and attachment lien creditors. We are of opinion, that the findings on this issue should not be disturbed, if for no other reason, because appellant failed to take any steps in the trial court to vacate the receivership. We fail to find in the record any motion or prayer on his part for such relief, and the only assault made upon the receivership by his pleadings in the court below, which we have been able to find, consisted of the following statement, incidentally made in parenthesis, “ not admitting, but denying, the legality of the receivership proceedings herein.” The rest of his plea seems to have contemplated the continuance of the receivership, which was supplemented by an agreed judgment to that effect, and we think he must be held to have acquiesced therein.</p>
    <p id="b93-6" data-blocks='[["BL_93.6",93,[123,1546,1302,982]],["BL_94.1",94,[249,352,1299,138]]]'>3. The fourth assignment, in the language of appellant, “goes to the right of the court in any case, other than a railway receivership, to fix upon the corpus of the property a lien prior to the first mortgage bonds,” which right is denied by him. This position seems to us to be.arbitrary, and without support in reason or authority. The ground upon which this right was denied in case of a navigation company (Bound’s case, 50 Federal Reporter, 312), relied upon by appellant, would seem to require that the doctrine should be held as applicable to the water works of a city or town as to a railway. In the one case, as in the other, the interposition of sovereign power is required to secure the land upon which it is constructed. It is there laid down, that this exercise of the right of eminent domain is bestowed by the sovereign in consideration of the continued public use, which public use, as there defined, arises when the sovereign power is essential to the enterprise, and is exercised because of such use. The bondholder lends his money with the knowledge of this condition. Rev. Stats., art. 478; see also, Karn <em>&amp; </em>Hickson v. Rorer Iron Co., <a href="/va/86/0754-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="86 Va. 754" data-case-ids="1879087" data-case-paths="/va/86/0754-01">86 Va., 754</a>. This question is placed beyond controversy, so far as debts and liabilities arising during the receivership are concerned, by the Act of 1889,amending article 1466 of the Revised Statutes. Sayles’ Add., art. 1466. This conclusion overrules the seventh assignment also, which <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>reads, “ The court erred in finding and decreeing that the cost, expenses, salary, etc., including receiver’s certificates, should be paid out of the proceeds arising from the sale of the property as preference liens.”</p>
    <p id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[247,503,1301,687]]]'>4. We are of opinion, however, that the sixth assignment, reading, “ The court erred in finding and decreeing that the $2404.55 of the earnings of the defendant were diverted to such purpose as gave the interveners and plaintiff a right to be paid to that extent out of the proceeds arising from a sale of the property itself,” must be sustained. These claims all originated long before the receivership. It appears that there were no net earnings from the operation of the plant pending the receivership; nor does it appear that the revenues previously expended upon the improvement and extension of the plant enhanced its value; nor that the holders of these claims had been in any way prevented from collecting the same by proceedings at law; nor that the company had been allowed by the mortgage bondholder to remain in possession and operate the plant after insolvency and default; nor that it had been suddenly deprived of the control of its property, or the like.</p>

To give such claims, under the circumstances disclosed by the record, a preference lien on the corpus of the estate, it seems to us, would be to go further than any case has yet gone in subordinating a fixed lien to a floating debt. McIlhenny v. Benz, 80 Texas, 13; Railway v. Humphries, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20U.S.%20103" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="145 U.S. 103">145 U.

By the Acts of 1887 and 1889, amending and enlarging the statute on that subject, the only claims made liens on the property in the hands of the receiver superior to the mortgage lien are judgments rendered for causes of action arising <em>during the receivership. </em>Sayles’ Add., art. 1466. Claims arising prior thereto are limited to a preference lien on the moneys coming into the hands of the receiver as the earnings of the property in his hands, and are last in the order of preference. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., arts. 1470d, 1470e, Add., 1466. Without net earnings, therefore,- no provision is made for their payment. The lien therein repeatedly declared to be superior to the mortgage lien on the corpus of the property is invariably limited to claims or <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>causes of action arising <em>during the receivership. </em>The only provision for the payment of antecedent floating debts out of the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property in preference to the debt secured by the mortgage, is where the receiver has spent current earnings coming into his hands as such in improving the property, whereby its value has been increased, and then only to the extent of the value of such improvements.
