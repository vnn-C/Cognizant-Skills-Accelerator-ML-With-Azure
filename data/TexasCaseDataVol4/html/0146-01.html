If appellee, as a passenger, abandoned a place of safety and undertook to perform the duty of a servant, it was because appellants exacted it of him in the contract. The provision of the contract requiring appellee to care for his stock will certainly be construed to be of as high dignity as an invitation of a servant, and that the authorities are all to the effect that if a passenger assumes a position of danger at the invitation of a servant of the railway, and is injured, he can recover his damages of the railway. Again, appellants having required of appellee in the contract that he care for his stock, appellee had the right to suppose that he could with safety do those acts necessary to care for his stock, and appellants owed him the duty to see that he was not injured by any fault of theirs in performing them. And whether appellee’s injury was caused by his own want of care, or whether it was caused by the negligence of appellants, were questions of fact which the verdict of the jury decided in appellee’s favor. Again, appellee was the consignor of the stock, and being injured while personally assisting in caring for them, with the knowledge and consent and by the procurement of appellants, is entitled to recover.

The shipper, in looking after his stock under such a grant of privilege or license from the carrier, does not lose his status as a passenger, and the duty of the carrier in the exercise of proper caution and care toward him still exists; and if the shipper, under such circumstances, exercises due care and caution, the carrier will be liable for the results of its negligence in inflicting injury upon him. But when exercising this privilege, granted by the carrier, the shipper fails in the exercise of proper care and caution, such consequences rest upon his shoulders, and the carrier is not responsible for injury received under such circumstances. The law does not deny the privilege of the shipper to look after his stock, if he so desires, under a license from the carrier, provided he does so in a prudent manner. What it does deny is the right of the carrier to contract away its duty in this respect. Granting the privilege to the shipper to look after his stock, and his doing so, is not necessarily the exercise of authority or the performance of an act that is in conflict with the duty of the carrier in that respect; doing this thing by the shipper does not relieve the carrier of its duty in the premises. If the shipper, in the exercise of that privilege, places himself in a position of peril and danger that does not <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>ordinarily exist to passengers generally in travelling upon freight trains, he assumes what extra risk may exist by reason of such acts; but performing the act that places him in such extra hazardous or dangerous position does not relieve the carrier from the exercise of proper care in ■its conduct towards him.</p>

The appellee, after this statement was made, went out of the caboose for the purpose of looking after his stock, which was in the car immediately in front of the caboose, and found one of his horses down in the end of the car next to the caboose; in order to get up the horse, he stood on the drawhead between the caboose and the car, and prodded the horse with a stick or pole, and while in such position, the train, within a few minutes after it had stopped, without signal, backed, and appellee’s foot was caught and crushed between the drawhead and the dead wood of the cars.</p>

The appellee contends, that he placed himself in the position he occupied when injured—that <em>is, </em>upon the draw-head between the cars—by reason of the statement made to him by the brakeman authorizing him to look after his stock, and that the train would remain stationary for sometime, believing that the effect of such statement was an invitation to that extent, and that he could rely upon the servants of the appellants not moving the train without a timely warning to him; contending that the authority, coming from the appellants through the bakeman, to him to look after his stock, implied the right for him to assume any position on or about the car that was neces■sary for him to occupy in order to get up the horse that was down, although such position may have been one of extra hazard or danger, and the effect of such invitation coming from the brakeman was notice to appellants that he might assume such dangerous position in his effort to look after his horses, and they were guilty of negligence in moving the train before giving him timely notice of their purpose. It is not denied but that the position upon the drawhead between two cars of a moving train, or one likely to move at any moment, is one of danger. Such is virtually admitted by the appellee; for when he was asked the question, “ Would you have put yourself in the position you did but for the state<a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>ment of the brakeman ?” he replied, “ I would not for the whole road;” thus recognizing the peril he assumed by reason of placing himself in that position, his excuse for so doing being the authority from the brakeman.</p>

It also appears, that when the brakeman made the statement he immediately left the caboose and went towards the front of the train, and that he nor any of the servants of the appellants engaged in operating the train knew of the position occupied by appellee until after he was injured. The moving of the train when appellee was standing on the drawhead was for the purpose of placing some cars upon the side track, which the conductor was ordered to place there. There is. evidence tending to prove that it is usual and customary to stand upon the drawhead of the trains when still, in order to get up stock that are down in a car.

Having invited the appellee to look after his stock, and given him the right to be there for that purpose, and having told him that the train would not move, the carrier should have known that he might be there; and being there, the facts and circumstances might show that he was engaged in working with his stock in such a position that was dangerous if the train should move. <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>and comparatively safe if it remained stationary. Finding that the invitation was extended by the carrier to the shipper to look after his stock, and that he was there for that purpose, and that it was usual and customary for the shipper to assume a position in accomplishing such purpose that was free from danger so long as the train was stationary, but became dangerous when moved, the duty would fairly be chargeable to the carrier of seeing that the shipper was not in danger, or refrain from doing any act that would increase his danger that from the facts and circumstances they might know would exist if the train was moved. From the fact of the invitation, knowing that the shipper might be looking after his stock, and knowing' that shippers usually may occupy positions of danger if the train was moved, the jury would be justified in inferring that the carrier was guilty of negligence in moving the train without proper and timely warning to the shipper of its purpose to do so, giving the shipper an opportunity to escape a danger that arose after he assumed such position. The position was not necessarily dangerous so long as the train remained standing, and the shipper was there by reason of a statement that the train would not move, but only became dangerous when it was moved.

As said before, this is the principal question in the case, because appellee’s right to be upon the drawhead—thus in a position of danger—and his right to recover is bottomed upon the authority of the brakeman to invite him to look after his stock, coupled with the statement that the train would not move for sometime. His own testimony shows that he assumed such position solely by reason of such statement.</p>

Railway v. Anderson, 82 Texas, 520; Woods’ Ry. Law, sec. 316. The agent’s power must stand upon either the express or implied authority conferred upon him by his principal.'

His duties ordinarily do not extend to the control and management of the train, but that power is lodged, as before said, in the conductor. The power to grant a license to the passenger-or to control the train is not within the apparent scope of his powers as a brakeman. The nature of his office does not imply that he is authorized to give directions on this subject that will bind the company. In order for the act of the agent to bind the principal, the act done must pertain to the particular duties of that employment; and the employment for a particular purpose gives only the authority necessary for that agency under ordinary. circumstances, or the authority usually exercised by similar agents. Under such circumstances as these, when it is undertaken to extend the authority of the agent beyond the exercise of power ordinarily vested'in him and beyond the apparent power that is implied by reason of his employment, the burden rests upon him who seeks to charge the principal to prove the existence of the authority in such agent.

If he found his horses next to the caboose that did not have a platform, he must accept the situation as he finds it, and he can not justify his position of peril or danger which he voluntarily assumed by saying, that “if you had done something that your duty did not require of you, I could have without injury performed■ that which I voluntarily attempted.”</p>

Under the strict rule of the common law, when parties were incompetent as witnesses in their own behalf, the reason or motive that influenced the performance of an act was to be gathered from the surrounding circumstances or the declarations explanatory of the act that would fall within the rule of res gestae. But in those jurisdictions where the common law rule of exclusion on account of interest has ceased to exist, and parties are permitted to testify, the courts have almost uniformly held, that when the physical act is the subject of inquiry, and the rights of the parties may depend upon the motive or reason that influenced the act, it is admissible, to show such motive or reason that actuated its performance. The reason given may not be binding upon the court or jury, and they may disregard it as impossible or not true, in reaching a result. They can weigh it like other evidence in the case.
