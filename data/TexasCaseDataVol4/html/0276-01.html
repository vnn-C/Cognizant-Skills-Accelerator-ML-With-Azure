    <p id="b303-7" data-blocks='[["BL_303.7",303,[163,946,1303,736]]]'>The facts found by the district judge are established by the evidence. It is proper to add, that the evidence offered by plaintiffs was sufficient to show that defendants had made honest efforts to sell the patent right in the counties named in the contract, and had failed to sell the same except in one county. It further appeared, that as early as October. 23 following the making of the contract, Edwards, one of the defendants, became dissatisfied, and by a letter addressed to one of the plaintiffs, expressed an intention not to further carry out the agreement, charging that misrepresentations had been made by plaintiffs, and that the right to sell the windlass in the same territory was held by other men. Subsequently further correspondence ensued, in which these complaints were repeated, and in which it was claimed that the original patentee had sold the same territory to other persons before plaintiffs had bought the right to control the sale of the windlass in the State. These charges were not true, according to the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b303-8" data-blocks='[["BL_303.8",303,[166,1695,1298,79]]]'>This, with the facts found by the court below, constitutes all the material evidence.</p>

Their obligation to make payments was to become fixed as the sales of counties should be made; and no cause of action could arise until such sales were made, or until the defendants failed or refused to make sales when it was in their power to do so. This, we think, is the just construction of the agreement. By framing the contract as it was framed, the plaintiffs made their right to the consideration, beyond the amount of the note, depend to this extent upon the ability of the defendants to make the contemplated sales; and we agree with the court below in the opinion that a reasonable time was intended in which sales might be made. The rights of plaintiffs under the contract did not, however, wholly depend upon the caprice of the defendants. They could not escape liability by refusing, without good reason or upon unfounded charges of misrepresentation and defective title, to <em>go </em>on with the undertaking; and had the facts adduced by plaintiffs <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>shown only such a case, the judgment might have been different. But as before seen, the evidence warranted the court below in finding that the patent was unsaleable, and that there was no sufficient proof of a failure on the part of defendants to make proper efforts to sell. It is unnecessary for us to determine what should be the effect in such a case of evidence tending to show the unsaleability of the article where no effort-had been made to sell. Here it is shown by the plaintiffs’ own evidence-that the defendants did try, at heavy loss to themselves, to vend the windlass, and almost wholly failed. The burden was upon the plaintiffs to show that the facts had transpired to fix liability upon the defendants, inasmuch as it did not result from the contract alone, and they failed to do so.</p>
