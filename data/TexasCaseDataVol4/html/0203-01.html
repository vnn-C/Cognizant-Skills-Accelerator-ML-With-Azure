On or about January 11,1887, Kneeland bought outMcLachlen’s interest in the firm, assuming its indebtedness, for the sum of 82000, paying §1400 in cash and giving the §600 note upon which this suit is brought.</p>
    <p id="b228-3" data-blocks='[["BL_228.6",228,[249,649,1313,1436]]]'>Defendant pleaded, that at that time McLachlen was so much indebted to the Arm that a fair adjustment between the partners would have left-his interest of no value whatever; on the contrary, he was largely indebted . to the Arm and to defendant. That all during the partnershipMcLachlen had kept its books and accounts, and knew that his attitude to the Arm was as above stated. That defendant had full conAdence in McLachlen’s integrity and accuracy, and in making the settlement, relied on his representations with respect to the condition of the business. That at the time of the settlement McLachlen. at defendant’s request, made a statement of the Anancial condition of the Arm, and in such statement, made it appear that he (McLachlen) was indebted to the Arm in the sum of §1941.16, that defendant was indebted to the Arm in the sum of §704,. and that the Arm owed other persons §1236.04. Then defendant proceeds to allege that the statement was false, and so known to be by Mc-Lachlen at the time. That the true condition of said accounts should have been, that McLachlen’s debit to the Arm on January 11, 1887, was §6531.26, and the total debit against appellant on same date $3214.81, so that appellee (McLachlen) was indebted to the Arm in excess of the-amount owed by appellant §3316.45, and not the sum of §1237.18, as-shown by the statement; and that this was not shown by the books, because of incorrect entries made therein by McLachlen in regard to the-sum of §5647.32 received by Kneeland &amp; Co., of which sum the Arm of Kneeland &amp; Harrison owned §3764.88, and the firm of Kneeland <em>&amp; </em>Co. §1882.44; he (McLachlen) having credited same on the books one-half, §2823.66, to himself, and one-half, §2823.66, to Kneeland; and that he(Kneeland) drew out of the firm the sum of §4000, with which to pay §3764.88 to Kneeland <em>&amp; </em>Harrison, and McLachlen charged appellant with all of this §4000, when the §3764.88 which went to Kneeland &amp; Harrison should not have been charged to Kneeland.</p>
    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.7",228,[247,2096,1306,290]]]'>Defendant also alleged, that McLachlen, by his said statement, misrepresented the indebtedness of the firm to be §1236.04, and that defendant relied upon this statement also in making the settlement and assuming the debts of the firm; that this indebtedness was much larger than §1236.04, but defendant does not state how much larger, and alleges his belief that it was in excess of §2000; and for general relief.</p>

      <em>“ </em>2. That Kneeiand was improperly charged with $3764.88 included in an entry of $4000 on March 1, 1884, but was informed of that fact some year or more before the dissolution, and did not use sufficient diligence in ascertaining whether same had been corrected.</p>

In ascertaining this amount, the plaintiff is credited with $1000 not shown on the books of the firm as money advanced by him.”</p>

Appellant says, that after the quarrel, he was under the impression that McLachlen had subsequently corrected the entry, but does not state how he obtained this impression. He also stated that McLachlen had made no direct statement to him that said entry had been corrected, and that he had never looked at the books, or had any one else examine them, to see if they had been corrected to conform tO' his contention. It appears also that the books had been open to appellant at all times.</p>
