Jordan filed a petition in the County Court of Kaufman County against A. -J. Jordan, for the guardianship of the person of Andrew Jordan, Jr., a minor 14 years of age, residing in said county. She set up in her petition, that she was married to A. J. Jordan (appellant) October 29, 1861, ■and they had five children, the said Andrew being the youngest. That ■on September 13, 1884, a divorce was granted by the District Court of Panola County, Texas, and that the custody of two of the children (the two girls) was decreed to said Sarah E. Jordan, and the custody of Andrew and his brother was decreed to the husband (the eldest child was of age). That said A. J. Jordan, the husband, is unfit to have the care of said minor, Andrew, because he has neglected the education of said child. That immediately after said divorce, defendant brought said child to Kaufman County, and plaintiff moved to Marshall. That during said time the minor has been hired out to various parties while defendant was off teaching school, and petitioner has not been allowed to see him, nor to write to him, nor send him books, etc.; that he was poorly provided for, and defendant had denied him the gift of clothing, etc., sent him by his mother; that he was not allowed the privilege of church and schools, nor of clean and comfortable clothing; and his physical, moral, and mental <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>training were neglected, setting out a number of alleged acts of negligence on the part of the father. She further sets up, that she has a good and comfortable home in the city of Marshall, and the two sisters have been well educated, and are refined in their manners; and that she is able to raise the minor and give him proper physical, moral, and mental training under Christian influences and in the refined and elevating society of the two sisters. She prays for an order in vacation giving her the custody of the child during the pendency of the application, and that A. J.. Jordan, Sr., be enjoined from exercising any control over or having-charge or custody of said minor during the pendency of the application;, and on final hearing for permanent guardianship of the person of said minor.</p>

Haymond, supra, the court, after quoting in full article 2871 of our divorce statute, says: “No more sacred trust or greater responsibility can be devolved upon a court than the duty of determining which one of the two contending parties shall have the control of their minor children. It is a question of the welfare of the child, rather than of outrage to the affections of a mother, and one that should be solved by all the circumstances and conditions surrounding the parties <em>at the time the final order shall be made.'” </em>The italics are ours.</p>
    <p id="b588-8" data-blocks='[["BL_588.7",588,[263,1491,1299,437]]]'>This sacred trust and grave responsibility of the trial court would be of but little importance if the same question could be adjudicated again between the same parties the next day, in another tribunal, the custodian selected by the court set aside, and the custody of the child awarded to the other parent. But it is contended that the County Court has general supervision over the appointment of guardians for minors, and in such supervision can appoint a guardian of the person of a minor, notwithstanding the decree of the District Court in settling the custody of the minor in a suit between the two parents.</p>
    <p id="b588-9" data-blocks='[["BL_588.8",588,[261,1941,1300,185]]]'>Mr. Bishop says: “ The relation of parent and child constitutes a status not altogether unlike that of husband and wife. Hence an order for the custody of the children is, in this sort of ex parte divorce, competent and proper.” Bish. on Marr. and Div.,,sec. 170.</p>
    <p id="b588-10" data-blocks='[["BL_588.9",588,[261,2138,1299,286]]]'>Under our statute the District Court is expressly given jurisdiction to determine the custody of the children. Where the father or mother is living, the County Court is not called upon to appoint a guardian of the persons of their minor children, but the natural guardianship of the parent is fully recognized, even to the extent of appointing by will the guardians of such children. Rev. Stats., arts. 2494-2497, inclusive.</p>
    <p id="b588-11" data-blocks='[["BL_588.10",588,[264,2437,1296,89]],["BL_589.1",589,[174,349,1302,335]]]'>Upon the decree of the District Court awarding the custody of a child to one of the parents, such parent is thereby selected by the court as the <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>natural guardian, entitled to all the rights and privileges and subject to all the duties and responsibilities of such natural guardian. In the case of Kahn v. Israelson, 62 Texas, 226, Judge Stayton says: “ Under the statutes now in force, the surviving parent is the natural guardian of his or her minor child; * * as to the person, the surviving parent, as under the former statute, <em>without appointment by the County Court, </em>is the guardian.” Cook v. Bybee, 24 Texas, 278.</p>
    <p id="b589-7" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[176,696,1299,237]]]'>So it is clear, that the guardianship of the <em>person </em>of a minor who has surviving parents is fixed by law, without an appointment of the County Court; and when the custody has been settled by a decree of the District Court in a divorce proceeding, the interference of another court should not be permitted.</p>
    <p id="b589-8" data-blocks='[["BL_589.6",589,[174,946,1301,233]]]'>But it is further contended by appellee, that the minor, Andrew Jordan, having reached the age of 14 years, is under the statute entitled to select his own guardian, and that having selected his mother, she is entitled to the appointment. Let us examine this question in the light of the statute. Rev. Stats., art. 2505.</p>
    <p id="b589-9" data-blocks='[["BL_589.7",589,[172,1194,1303,339]]]'>1 ‘A minor who is 14 years of age or over has the right to select a guardian either of his person or estate, or both, which selection may be made in open court, in person or by attorney, and the person selected, if qualfied, shall be entitled to be appointed guardian, <em>except in the case where the surviving parent of such minor has appointed a guardian by will or written declaration, in which case the person so appointed shall be entitled to the guardianship.”</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b589-10" data-blocks='[["BL_589.8",589,[172,1545,1301,434]]]'>Also, in article 2510, which gives the right to a minor over 14 years of age to change his guardian, the same exception is made. So that the natural right of the parent to the guardianship of the person of his minor child can not be changed at the will of the minor when he arrives at the age of 14 years, nor can the minor change the appointment of a guardian appointed by the will or written declaration of the parent. The right of a minor over 14 years of age to choose his guardian applies only to such minors as have no surviving parents nor “ guardians appointed by them by will or written declaration.”</p>
    <p id="b589-11" data-blocks='[["BL_589.9",589,[173,1992,1300,188]]]'>How far the District Court of Panola County, which rendered the decree awarding the custody of the minor to appellant, could go in reopening or changing its decree, it is not necessary .for us here to inquire.

It may be that if the question was before us as an original proposition, we would not make the same decree as was made by that court; but such is not the case, and in this collateral <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>proceeding we are compelled to recognize the binding authority of that adjudication.</p>
