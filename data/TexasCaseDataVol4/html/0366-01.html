The evidence shows that about the 16th of August, Ilurlburt, who was the agent of the appellee in shipping the goods, notified the appellant that the machinery was to be used for the purpose of ginning cotton for the fall season of that year, and requested the appellant to hurry up the shipment. It appears that the machinery was bought for the purpose of being run as a gin during the summer and fall of that year, and was intended to be put into immediate operation for the purpose of ginning cotton as soon as it would arrive. It appears from the testimony that <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>this machinery was shipped from Oswego about the 10th of August, and did not arrive in Brownwood, Texas, until about the 6th of September; and it further appears that a reasonable time for such shipment was about nine or ten days.</p>

The loss resulting from the use of the property during such time, we think, is a proper item of damages in such cases.</p>

The weight of evidence in the case shows that the reasonable rental value of the machinery during the time of this delay was from $20 to $30 a day; place this value at the lowest amount, and it shows that the verdict of the jury was for a less amount than the appellee was entitled to.</p>

      <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>There is no allegation to this effect beyond that asking a recovery for rents. But if the facts in this respect had been fully alleged, the-evidence upon this issue falls far short of making a case showing that-such damages or rents or such intended use of the machine was within the contemplation of the carrier and the shipper at the time the contract of shipment was entered into. The only evidence bearing upon this-question is that Hurlbut, one of the consignees, several days after the contract of shipment was entered into, and presumably after the goods were en route, notified the appellant of the purpose for which said machine was intended, and requested it to expedite the shipment. There is no pretense that the carrier knew of such purpose at the time of making the contract of shipment. The special damages for the value of the use or rent of the machine sought to be recovered in this case can only be allowed when they ensue as a result of the breach of the contract entered into at the time of the shipment. These damages are either recoverable ■ only as the result of an express contract with the carrier that it should be so bound or from an implied liability resting upon the carrier by reason of the facts and circumstances surrounding the parties at the time the contract of shipment was made. There is no pretense in this case that, the carrier is liable for the value of rent of the machine by reason of an express contract to that effect. If the facts and circumstances put the carrier upon notice or convey to it knowledge of the purpose and intended use of the machine, then it would become liable for the damages that may result to the shipper as a consequence of the delay. This being upon the theory that the special circumstances and purpose of the shipment being known to the carrier, it must use such reasonable diligence in the performance of its contract of carriage as would place the shipper in a position to reap the profits or enjoy the use that the parties contemplated and considered at the time of shipment would result to him if the-goods had been delivered within a reasonable time.</p>

This upon the principle • that the carrier, by reason of the additional risk and the increased liability, may enter into suitable stipulations looking to its protection. It is not enough to give notice to the carrier after the contract is made and the shipment has started in its transportation, because the liability of the carrier can not be increased by the subsequent knowledge of facts that did not exist in the contemplation of the parties at the time the engagement was entered into.</p>
