The engineer does not claim that he rang the bell.\nThe omission to give the signals required by statute is negligence, which makes the company liable where injury to stock results. Railway v. Turner, 78 Mo., 578; Railway v. Reid, 24 Ill., 149. The evidence supports the verdict.\nThe allowance of interest on the value of the mule was error. Railway v. Mulrow, 54 Texas, 233.\nThe judgment will be reversed and here rendered for $100, found by the jury as the value of the mule, as appellee asks that be done if the allowance of interest is held to be error. The costs of the appeal are adjudged against appellee.\nReversed and rendered.",
