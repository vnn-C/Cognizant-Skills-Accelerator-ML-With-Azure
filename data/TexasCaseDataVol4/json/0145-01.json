That there is only one surety on said bond besides Magee.\nThe point here raised is, that the appeal bond is insufficient because it has only one surety; that Magee is not a proper surety, as judgment was rendered against him for damages and costs, by reason of his being a surety on the injunction bond.\nWe will follow the cases of Trammell v. Trammell, 15 Texas, 291; Saylor v. Marx, 56 Texas, 90; and Sampson v. Solinsky, 75 Texas, 663, which authorizes us to hold the bond sufficient. The alleged defects in the bonds passed upon in those cases, and the liabilities of the sureties against whom the judgments were rendered, are practically the same as exist in the case before us.\nMotion to dismiss the appeal will be overruled.\nMotion overruled.",
