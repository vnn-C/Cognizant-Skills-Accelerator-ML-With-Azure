    "head_matter": "Llano Improvement Company v. G. M. Watkins.\nNo. 431.\n1. Impossible Date \u2014 Return on Citation. \u2014 Citation was returned, Came to hand the 24th day of September, A. D. 1891, at 12 o'clock a. m., and executed the 24th day of-, 189\u2014, by delivering to,\u201d etc. (regular in other respects). Held, the date of service is impossible. The return is fatally defective, and on appeal can not support the judgment.\n2. Interest on Stipulated Attorney Fee.\u2014Where a stipulated rate of interest is contained in a note providing for an attorney fee in case if placed in hands of an attorney for collection, it is not error to allow the contract interest upon the entire judgment, including the stipulated attorney fee.\nAppeal from the County Court of Llano.\nTried below before Hon. W. S. Maxwell, County Judge.\nMiller & Landreth, for appellant.\nAny judgment is erroneous which is rendered by default on service of a citation the return on which shows that it was served on the 24th day of the year 189\u2014. Scott & Sparrow v. Watts, 1 W. & W. C. C., 89; Underhill v. Lockett, 20 Texas, 130.\nSlator & McLean, for appellee.\n1. If citation is merely defective, and defendant does not take his exceptions at the proper time, he can not be heard to urge it as error in appellate court. Cave v. City of Houston, 65 Texas, 622; Crain v. Griffis, 14 Texas, 358. The general rule is, a party will not be heard in the appellate court until he has exhausted his remedies in the lower court. Morris v. Gordon, 36 Texas, 72; Allen v. Traylor, 31 Texas, 125; Hopkins v. Donahoe, 4 Texas, 336, 338; Bank v. Lee, 13 Pet., 119; Buckley\u2019s Admr. v. Howard, 35 Texas, 566; Pierson v. Burney, 15 Texas, 274. Where there was a mere clerical error in the writ, which might have been amended, but the defendant was silent in the court below, suffering judgment to go against Mm by default, he can not make the objection avail him in the appellate court. The State v. Franklin, 35 Texas, 499.\n2. The judgment of the court bearing interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from date thereof on the gross amount of the principal, inter-\u00abst, and attorney fees found to be due at date of judgment, is correct. Rev. Stats., art. 2980; Washington v. Bank, 64 Texas, 4; Hagood v. Aikin, 57 Texas, 511.\nDelivered October 25, 1893."
