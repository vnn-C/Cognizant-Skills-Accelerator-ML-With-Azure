It does not show that a judgment overruling a motion for a new trial was rendered. It discloses that the bond filed as an appeal bond is conditioned, \u201c that appellant shall prosecute his appeal with effect, and shall pay all costs which have accrued in the court below, or which may accrue in the Court of Civil Appeals.\u201d\nTo give this court jurisdiction to affirm a case on certificate, the certificate of the clerk must show that an appeal was perfected. An appeal to this court is perfected by the appellant giving notice of appeal in open court within two days after final judgment overruling motion for new trial, and filing with the clerk an appeal bond. Art. 1387, p. 43, called sess. 22nd Leg. The condition of the bond provided is, \u201c that appellant shall prosecute his appeal with effect, and shall pay all costs which have accrued in the court below and which may accrue in the Court of Civil Appeals and the Supreme Court (article 1400, page 44, called session Twenty-second Legislature), unless appellant desires to suspend the execution of the judgment, in which case the condition of the bond is prescribed in the succeeding article.\nAs the notice of appeal was not given within two days after final judgment, and the bond is not such as is provided, the appeal was not perfected to this court, and it has no jurisdiction to grant appellee\u2019s motion.\nDelivered September 13, 1893.\nWherefore the motion is overruled, and the certificate dismissed at appellee\u2019s costs.\nDismissed.",
