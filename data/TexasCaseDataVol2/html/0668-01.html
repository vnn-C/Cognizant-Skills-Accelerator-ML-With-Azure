To entitle a single man to a homestead exemption, it is necessary for him to allege and prove that the persons who constitute the family are such persons as the law or morals require him to support and provide for, and in addition to that, he must allege and prove that such person or persons are dependent on him for maintenance and support—not simply that he supports them.

I am a single man,-years of age, and have never been married. I own the house and lot, the subject matter of this suit. I bought the lot something over three years ago for a home for my widowed mother, my sister, and myself. My mother is well advanced in years, and has no other homestead. Soon after I bought the lot, I built the house now on it, and when completed, my mother and sister, and also a younger brother, moved in the house, and they and myself have been living in it ever since as a home, and neither my mother nor I have any other home. I bought and paid for all the furniture in the house, except a few things in my mother’s room belonging to my mother. We occupied the house as our home at the date of the execution which was enjoined in this case, and now so occupy it. I support my mother out of my own earnings.”</p>

It is true, it is not stated in so many words that appellant’s mother had no other property, and was dependent upon him for a support, but we believe that this is the fair construction that should be placed upon the evidence. It is stated that his mother has no other home, and that he <a id="p670" href="#p670" data-label="670" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*670</a>supports her out of his own earnings, and we believe it would be attributing to appellant qualities far above the average to co'nstrue this evidence as meaning that he is taking care of his mother out of his own earnings, although she has property from which she could support herself.</p>
    <p id="b696-5" data-blocks='[["BL_696.5",696,[266,536,1300,341]]]'>We believe it would comport more with common experience to look for the son to use the mother’s property in supporting himself, rather than expect him to support an <em>independent </em>mother out of his own earnings. If his mother is dependent upon him for a support, it can hardly be contended that appellant would not be entitled to this exemption. Roco v. Green, 50 Texas, 483; Wolfe v.
