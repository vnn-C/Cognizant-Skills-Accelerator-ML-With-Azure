A fireman of a piledriver engine, while shovelling coal into the engine from a connected box car in which the coal was kept, was injured by being jolted off the flat car upon which was the piledriver engine, by the striking of a moving train against it. The piledriver engine was near one end of the fiat car, and was usually enclosed by a house with a sliding door at the end next to the coal car, in which the fireman might stand while shovelling coal, and protect himself from falling when jolted by grasping that end of the house. When the accident occurred that end of the house was entirely open. Plaintiff had been in the employ of the defendant company as pile engine fireman for a year or more. He alleged that defendant had promised to replace the end of the house within a very short time, as had always been the custom before when it had been removed, and that relying upon said promise and custom, he continued to remain in plaintiff’s employ, discharging his said duties, being induced to do so by said conduct, words, and action of defendant. The theory of the plaintiff was, that the master having so promised, and the injury having occurred within a reasonable time for the performance of the promise, and the defect not being of such a dangerous character as that a prudent man would not have continued in the service, in view of the promise, that defendant was liable. The effect of the allegation with respect to promise would be to relieve plaintiff from the negligence contributing to the injury. by remaining in the service when the danger was apparent, and the question of his negligence was one for the jury.</p>

Negligence of B'ellow Servant.—It can not be said that the jolt was an intervening or independent cause contributing to the injury, and that the defendant would not be liable because it was the negligence of a fellow servant, for it was against such contingencies that the end of the house would reasonably be inferred to be a protection.</p>

Promise to Repair.—Plaintiff knew of the defect, and the additional risk, and unless he is protected by a promise, express or implied, to remedy the defect by replacing the end of the house, he can not recover. Prior to June 3 the end of the house was taken out. The plaintiff went to work as fireman on June 5; the injury occurred Friday, the 7th. The evidence showed no promise to replace the end of the house on any named day; the inference from it being that the foreman would fix it as soon as he got through the work he was then at. The custom of the defendant’s employes was to replace the end of the house on Sunday. The plaintiff testified that he thought they would put it up on Sunday. It <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>is therefore clear that he was not induced to remain in the service by any promise, either express or implied, to replace the end of the house, and therefore he can not recover.</p>

Plaintiff also averred that defendant had promised to replace said plank forming the end of said house within a very short time, and by its action induced plaintiff to believe that the same would be replaced within a very short time; and that relying on such promise, and on the custom and habit of defendant to replace the end of said house as aforesaid as soon as the engine was returned to the same, plaintiff continued to remain in defendant’s employ, and discharge the duties of a fireman in and about said engine, being induced thus to continue the same by reason of the conduct, words, and actions of the defendant as aforesaid.

Drew, 59 Texas, 12. Plaintiff alleged that the accident would not have occurred but for the fact that the end of the house had not been replaced, and that defendant had promised to replace it within a very short time, and by its action induced plaintiff to believe that it would be replaced as promised; and that relying on the promises of defendant, and the custom and habit of defendant to replace the end, plaintiff continued to remain in its employ and the discharge of his duties.

In Hough v. Railway, 100 United States, 224, the court said: “If under all the circumstances, and in view of the promises to remedy the defect, the fengineer was not wanting in due care in continuing to use the engine, then the company will not be excused for the omission to supply proper machinery upon the ground of contributory negligence.” So it would seem that proof of a promise to replace the end of the engine house would be admissible as evidence to show that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, and that, the question should be submitted to a jury.

That the train was moving at the time of the accident, and it was gross negligence for the-plaintiff to be at work at the time on the piledriver car. That no promise was made to plaintiff of such character as would relieve him from the risk caused by removing and not replacing the end of the piledriver car.”</p>
    <p id="b99-6" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[147,1082,1306,1279]]]'>We think that it conclusively appeared from the evidence that whatever defect or danger there was in the operation of the piledriver and the-engine with the end out, was equally as open and obvious to the plaintiff as it was to the defendant. The evidence showed that the piledriver and the engine by which it was operated were placed upon a flat car; the pile-driver being at one end and the engine at the other end of the car. Around the engine was erected a house large enough to enclose the engine, which had an upright boiler; three sides were fixed fast to the car, but the side or end of the house next to the end of the car was composed of four pieces of planks bolted in position, so that they might be unbolted and the end taken out for the purpose of removing the engine from the car when it became convenient to do so. When in position, the end of the house was so arranged that the middle planks slided to each side and formed a door or opening through which one might pass into the house and around the engine. Just next to this end of the piledriver car was a box car used as a tender for coal, tools, etc. It was the duty of plaintiff as fireman of the engine to shovel coal from the box car into the furnace of the engine. The house came within five inches of the end of the flat car on which it was situated, and in shovelling in coal plaintiff would stand sometimes with one foot on this part of the car and the other in the box car; but when the. end of the house was in position it was shown that he could stand in the door so as to brace himself and keep from falling, and that in case of a jolt or jar he would have something to catch hold of. When the end of the house was not in place there was no way to brace himself, nor was there anything to catch hold of, if he should be about to fall from the jolting of the cars.</p>
    <p id="b99-7" data-blocks='[["BL_99.6",99,[152,2373,1299,137]],["BL_100.1",100,[278,342,1301,735]]]'>It was perfectly obvious that an attempt to shovel coal into the engine while the train was in motion, with the end of the house out, would be attended with danger. When the accident occurred the piledriver car <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>had been taken into Houston for dinner, and the conductor of the train and the other employes were setting timber in position so as to go to work; the train was switching at the time. Plaintiff testified, that at the time he was shovelling the coal into the engine the train was not in motion, and that the jolt occurred just as he had finished and thrown the shovel into the box car; but all of the other eye-witnesses state that the train was in motion. Whether the train was in motion or not, there was no danger or defect about the condition of the engine house that the plaintiff was not fully aware of, and unless he is protected in remaining in the employ of the defendant by a promise, express or implied, to remedy the defect by replacing the end of the house, he can not recover. And it is doubtful if our Supreme Court would recognize the exception at all, unless the employe, having continued in this employment on the strength of the promise, should be ignorant at the time of the accident of the fact that the employer had failed to comply with his promises.</p>

Why didn’t they put up the back part of the house as I asked them to do ?’ While I was lying there bleeding I said to them, ‘ Why didn’t you put up the end as I asked you ? ’ ”</p>
    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[173,887,333,36]]]'>Q. Who was that ?</p>
    <p id="b101-6" data-blocks='[["BL_101.6",101,[126,937,1304,92]]]'>A. A foreman, Freeland. He said, “ Do you suppose we were going to accommodate you ? ” That was while I was lying on my bunk bleeding.</p>
    <p id="b101-7" data-blocks='[["BL_101.7",101,[129,1038,1300,88]]]'>Q. Did you run this risk, you say, as you thought they were going to put this up on Sunday ?</p>
    <p id="b101-8" data-blocks='[["BL_101.8",101,[128,1137,1302,87]]]'>A. They had always put it up on Sunday; they said they were going to fix it up.</p>
    <p id="b101-9" data-blocks='[["BL_101.9",101,[125,1237,1306,487]]]'>He further stated that they always put the end in on Sunday before. The only promise that can be at all inferred from this evidence is, that the foreman said that he would put the end in when he got through with the work that they were then at; and it nowhere appears that the plaintiff ever relied on this indefinite promise, for he says he thought they would put it up on Sunday, as they were in the habit of putting it up then; and it is clear that the plaintiff was not induced to remain in the service by any promise, either express or implied, to replace the end of the house. This was all the evidence as to a promise; the foreman denied having had any such conversation with plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b101-10" data-blocks='[["BL_101.10",101,[128,1736,1301,185]]]'>It is unnecessary to notice the remaining assignments of error. They relate to the giving and refusing of charges. The charge of the court, taken as a whole, with the instructions given at the request of the defendant, was a fair presentation of the case.</p>
    <p id="b101-11" data-blocks='[["BL_101.11",101,[129,1934,1301,129]]]'>Because the verdict of the jury was contrary to the evidence in the respect pointed out, the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>
    <p id="b101-12" data-blocks='[["BL_101.12",101,[964,2083,418,31]]]'>
      <em>Reversed and </em>remanded.</p>
    <p id="b101-13" data-blocks='[["BL_101.13",101,[174,2132,509,39]]]'>Delivered January 26, 1893.</p>
