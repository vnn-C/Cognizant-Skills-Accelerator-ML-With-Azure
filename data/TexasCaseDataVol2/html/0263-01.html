Void Note—Illegal Consideration.—A note given to a liquor dealer in payment for liquors sold by him to an habitual drunkard, or to an;7 person after having received notice from the wife, mother, sister, or daughter not to sell such person intoxicating liquors, is void for want of good consideration, in the hands of the original payee.</p>

Habitual Drunkard — Definition. — It was error to define the term habitual drunkard, in a suit on such a note, as “ one whose mind had become so impaired by the use of intoxicating liquors or drugs, that he is incapable of taking care of himself or property.” This is the definition in the statute relating to guardianship, and is for the purpose of determining when a guardian of the person and estate shall be appointed, and does not apply to the meaning of the term when used in the statute providing for the execution of a bond by a liquor dealer. It is here used in its common acceptation, and the capacity of the person to take care of himself or property is not in issue.</p>

Liquor Dealer’s Bond—Penalties for Violation.—The purpose of' the statute in requiring a bond from a liquor dealer, with the conditions prescribed, was to prevent the sale of liquors to the prohibited classes of purchasers named. A sale, then, in violation of the conditions of the bond, is a sale in violation of law, and the consideration for such sales would be illegal because growing out of a transaction sought to be prohibited by law; and not only may recovery be had of the statutory penalty, but the recovery of the consideration money by the seller may be defeated.</p>

    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[151,538,1315,733]]]'>In the charge the court defined the term ‘1 habitual drunkard” as de- . fined in Revised Statutes, article 2473, of the title on guardian and ward, as “ one whose mind has become so impaired by the use of intoxicating liquors or drugs that he is incapable of taking care of himself or property.” This was error. The definition in the statute relating to guardianship is for the purpose of determining when a guardian of the person and estate shall be appointed, and does not apply to the meaning of the term as used in the statute providing for the execution of a bond by persons obtaining license as retail liquor dealers. Sayles’ Ann. Stats., art. 3226a, sec. 4. It is here used in its common acceptation, and the capacity of the person to take care of himself or property is not in issue and is immaterial. The jury must determine from the common understanding of the term as to whether or not the person is an habitual drunkard. Trigg v. The State, 49 Texas, 676; Tatum v.

Our Supreme Court has held that a note given for usurious interest is void even in the hands of an innocent holder. Andrews v. Hoxie, 5 Texas, 171. But in this case there is no direct prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors to an habitual drunkard, or to a person after notice as provided by law; nor is there any declaration that a note given in consideration of such sales shall be void. 1 Dan. on Neg.

It was held that as between the parties the notes were void for want of consideration.</p>

    <p id="b292-6" data-blocks='[["BL_292.6",292,[254,778,1302,784]]]'>The purpose of the statute in requiring as a prerequisite to the license the execution of the bond with the condition prescribed, is clearly to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors to habitual drunkards, and to any person whose wife, mother, sister, or daughter shall forbid the sale in the manner prescribed by the statute. Sayles’ Ann. Stats., art. 3226a, sec. 4. A sale, then, in violation of the condition of the bond as prescribed by law is a sale in violation of law. Notwithstanding the fact that the law prescribes a penalty for the breach of the condition of the bond, yet, we think, the evident purpose of the statute being to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors to habitual drunkards and to persons after notice as prescribed, the consideration for such liquors would be illegal, because growing out of a transaction sought to be prohibited by law. Not only can the recovery of the penalty fixed by the statute be had, but the recovery of the consideration money by the seller may be defeated. The contract would be illegal and void as between the parties. Poll, on Con., 260; Wood’s Mast, and Serv., secs. 198-200; 1 Pars, on Con., 458.</p>

This is a much stronger case; for here the sale itself is sought to be prohibited, while in the Alabama case the inspection of the guano was the purpose of the law.</p>
