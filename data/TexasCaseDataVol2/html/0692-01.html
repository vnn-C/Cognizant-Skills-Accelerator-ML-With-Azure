Because the petition does not give any proper description of the land or state a proper cause of action. Second. Because the same is purely an action in trespass to try title to lands and for rents, and is such an action as is unknown, except by statute; is not afforded to and can not be maintained by the State against a citizen, for the State can neither be ejected nor dis-seized of her land or her public domain.

      <em>Validity of the </em>Surveys.—1. The important question is, whether, under the peculiar facts of this case, applicants may lawfully purchase public lands under the Act of July 14, 1879, as amended March 11, 1881, without having the lands surveyed for them in the field. It is admitted here, that there was no actual survey for Bacon and Graves. The field notes were copied literally by the deputy surveyor Berry from the Elgin survey (which we will show was illegal and void), and were, with only a few exceptions, also literally copied therefrom by the deputy surveyor Williams. Each of these deputies testified that he had done surveying on block 97, of which this land was only a part, but neither could say whether he ever tested the accuracy of the Elgin survey of this particular <a id="p702" href="#p702" data-label="702" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*702</a>land. In other words, their theory is, that having tested some of Elgin’s work and found it substantially correct, they concluded that all of it was, and consequently adopted it.</p>

In order to give them a right to purchase, the statute requires that persons desiring to do so shall cause the land “to be surveyed by the authorized public surveyor of the county or district in which said land is situated.” It is only when the applicant has caused a survey of the land to be made for him that the proposition of the State is accepted, and contractual relations are formed. The State’s requirements must be strictly complied with before any rights attach. It has demanded a survey for the particular purchaser, and it has the right to insist that the demand shall be strictly met. That a survey of the land has been previously made is of no consequence. In view of the many and gross inaccuracies in surveys throughout the State, known to the Legislature and this court, it was but a measure of caution and protection against land spoliation that a survey for the person desiring to purchase should in all cases be made. The law having made it a prerequisite that the person desiring to purchase “ may do so by causing the tract or tracts which such person desires to purchase to be surveyed,” it is not competent for any executive officer or the courts to dispense with the requirement and substitute for it a survey made many years before for another person or corporation.

This is not sufficient, and is not a performance of the contract between the parties. “ If one of two parties is to do a thing, whereupon the other is to do something else, the former can not sue the latter for nonperformance until he has himself performed.

In such case, we think they should show that they have obtained the field notes in the manner the State said they should be obtained in its prqposition, and not that they have got as good field notes in some other way as would have been obtained had they complied with the State’s offer. Had an individual owned this large body of land, and had published and offered to sell to any person 640 acres, who would have it surveyed by the authorized public surveyor of the county in which the land was situated, arid that such surveyor must certify that the work was actually done in the field, we think it would hardly be contended that the proposed purchaser could file his petition against the owner, setting up that the surveyor had copied some field notes for him from the work which had been done by some other <a id="p711" href="#p711" data-label="711" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*711</a>surveyor years before, and that by reason of the field notes thus obtained he had a right to compel the owner to accept such field notes as a compliance with his offer, and to execute a deed for the land embraced therein; and we see no reason why a different rule should be applied to the State than that applied to an individual under similar circumstances. We know of no case in which the State, as a compliance with an executory contract, was held bound against its wish to accept one of these office surveys, even under the old law; and still less do we believe that it could be compelled to accept such field notes under the law as it was at the time these surveys purport to have been made.</p>
    <p id="b737-4" data-blocks='[["BL_737.4",737,[150,827,1306,527]]]'>We think the court did not err in overruling appellants’ special exceptions to the petition of the State. Appellants had filed an application to purchase land under the Act of 1879, giving the description of their desired purchase substantially as set forth in the petition in this case, thereby showing that they assert claim to that part of the State’s land, and we think they can not be heard to say that such description was not sufficient in a petition brought to cancel their claim; besides, the answer filed by appellants contained a sufficient description of that part of the land embraced in the State’s petition which they claimed, and we see no reason why such description would not serve as a basis for the judgment rendered.</p>

We think the circumstances disclosed by the record lead to this conclusion, and would have justified a finding that, before he tendered his resignation, Graves and Bacon had come to an understanding as to the terms of their contract, and that Graves’ resignation was tendered in pursuance of this understanding, to enable him successfully to carry out the arrangement that had previously been understood would be made when it might be legally done; but as what we have said disposes of all the land in controversy, and as we have not fully decided as to the effect the agreement above indicated would have in a case where all steps prescribed by the law in the acquisition of the land from the State were taken, after the resignation <a id="p712" href="#p712" data-label="712" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*712</a>had become complete, we have thought it best to express no opinion, thereon.</p>

We incline to the opinion that the question of responsibility, within the meaning of the Act of 1879, was for the surveyor to decide; and if he held them responsible parties and made the survey, this, would be sufficient to hold the land until the expiration of the time allowed the purchaser in which to make payment. We do not believe it was the policy of the law to restrict such sales to persons who, upon investigation of their financial condition, would be found able to pay for the land proposed to be purchased out of their own means, and thereby preclude those equally worthy, who, while not actually owning sufficient property of their own to make the payment, might yet be able, in the time-allowed, to make the necessary financial arrangements.

    <p id="b738-6" data-blocks='[["BL_738.6",738,[247,1179,1309,487]]]'>If the court, in its third conclusion of law,' intended to hold that because some of the surveys had a greater frontage of permanent water than is permitted under law, this would invalidate all of the surveys, we do not think the conclusion correct. It will be noted, that under this law the land was only to be sold in tracts of 640 acres, and we think that, under these provisions each tract must be treated as a separate purchase; and while the sections having such excessive water frontage might be held invalid, in so far as it would enable the proposed purchaser to demand title from the State as to them, yet these invalid sections could still be used as a basis to locate and identify the other surveys in the block.</p>

As.stated above, we think each section must be taken as a separate purchase, and the tender made by them sufficiently identified all sections upon which they proposed to pay; and the fact that they did not make tender upon all of the sections embraced in the field notes returned by them would only have the effect to invalidate such part of the proposed purchase as was not. designated in their offer to pay.</p>

Bostick, 58 Texas, 67); but we are not <a id="p713" href="#p713" data-label="713" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*713</a>prepared to say that the evidence outside of this certificate was not sufficient to sustain the finding of the court below that these surveys were never in fact so returned. There was no objection to the certificate of the Commissioner to prove that he had made search for the field notes of these surveys, and had been unable to find them in the General Land Office, and that they were not at the time of making said certificate in their proper places; and we think it quite as probable that these field notes-had been lost or mislaid before they reached the Land Office as after, and for this reason the judgment of the court below as to these surveys could be sustained without reference to the objectionable part of this certificate; but as the bill of exceptions shows that the court below must have considered this part of the certificate of the Commissioner as important evidence to sustain its finding upon this point, we are of opinion, that were, it material in the disposition of the case, it would necessitate a reversal as to these surveys.</p>
