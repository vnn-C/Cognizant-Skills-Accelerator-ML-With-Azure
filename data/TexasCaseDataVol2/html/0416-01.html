    <p id="b444-11" data-blocks='[["BL_444.11",444,[276,1633,1303,235]]]'>Second. That under the act of the Legislature creating Frio County, it was attached to Medina County for judicial purposes; and that the land being in Frio County, the execution should have been issued to and sale-made by the sheriff of Medina County; and that the sale made by the sheriff of Bexar County was a nullity and passed no title.</p>

Taylor, 7 Texas, 240, the reason for such a rule does not exist in this State; but previous to that decision, the question under consideration had been de<a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>tennined in Howard v.

That case was approved and followed in Clark v. Goss, 12 Texas, 396, and Lumpkin v. Muncey, 66 Texas, 311.</p>

    <p id="b445-11" data-blocks='[["BL_445.10",445,[140,1942,1303,585]],["BL_446.1",446,[281,341,1296,88]]]'>The solution of this question is not free from difficulty. If the statute read, for judicial purposes, without qualification, the case would fall within the doctrine announced in Folts v. Ferguson, 77 Texas, 301, and the ruling of the court below would be clearly correct. But such is not the case. It contains limitations, both express and implied, that take it out of the general rule declared in that case. We think the controlling purpose of the section referred to was to furnish the people of the newly created counties the most convenient courts in which to conduct their important litigation and perform the greater part of their jury service. In our view, this provision should be construed as though it read thus: “ That until by law attached to some judicial district or districts, each of said counties shall be attached to the nearest county in which District <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>Courts may be held, for judicial purposes in all matters appertaining to the jurisdiction of said courts.”</p>
    <p id="b446-3" data-blocks='[["BL_446.4",446,[279,440,1298,281]]]'>The fact that the Legislature used the expression “ counties in which the District Court may be held ” supports the conclusion that the purpose was to limit the section transferring jurisdiction, not to matters pertaining to the jurisdiction of District Courts generally, but to such matters as appertained to the jurisdiction of the District Courts of the particular counties to which the new counties were attached.</p>
    <p id="b446-4" data-blocks='[["BL_446.5",446,[280,740,1297,335]]]'>As we adopt this construction, it becomes unnecessary for us to determine the extent of the power and authority that was conferred upon the District Courts to which it is limited. It did more, however, than prescribe venue for legal proceedings. It constituted Frio a part of Medina County as to all proceedings in the District Court of the latter. Whether or not this would include execution sales under judgments rendered by the District Court of Medina County need not be determined in this case.</p>
    <p id="b446-5" data-blocks='[["BL_446.6",446,[276,1088,1302,1037]]]'>But in all matters pertaining to or founded upon proceedings in other courts, whether Supreme, District, County, or Justice Courts, jurisdiction remained with Bexar, the parent county. It can not be disputed, that while this law was in force Bexar County was the proper and necessary place to sell real estate in Frio County, under an execution issued upon a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court or by a justice of the peace. Bexar County retained jurisdiction in all proceedings in probate matters, and over all suits and proceedings below District Court jurisdiction, including sales of real estate under execution. It remained the place to record deeds, to pay taxes; and when necessary to sell real estate for taxes, Bexar County was the proper place to make such sales. This being the case, is there any thing in the language of the statute warranting the conclusion, that when for so many governmental purposes jurisdiction was left with Bexar County, including all other judicial sales, it was intended that an execution sale under a judgment of a District Court must be made in Medina County ? With the possible exception of sales made under executions from the District Court of Medina County, we think not. At any rate, it is not clear that such was the legislative purpose, and if the statute is ambiguous, considerations of uniformity and harmony in the law suggest the propriety of holding that the mother county was the proper place for such sales.</p>

To have subjected land in Frio County belonging to the judgment debtor to the payment of these judgments, would it have been necessary to issue one execution to Bexar County and the other to Medina County ? According to appellee’s contention, it would.</p>

It follows, therefore, that no construction can be placed upon it—unless it be restricted to fixing venue only—which will not be productive of some confusion; but we believe the one which we have adopted will more nearly harmonize it with other laws and effectuate the legislative purpose than would the adoption of the interpretation contended for by appellees.</p>
