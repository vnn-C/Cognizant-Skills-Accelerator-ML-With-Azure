Speaking of this subject, Henderson, C. J., says: 1 For the uses and purposes of a highway it (the highway) is the sovereign’s—the public’s; for all other purposes it is the former proprietor’s. The right of using it as a landing place for a ferry has never been taken from him; and although there is scarcely a perceptible difference between stepping from a boat on the land and stepping from land to land, yet that has never been taken from the former proprietor for such purposes, as he has never been compensated for the right (limited as above stated) of transporting persons across the watercourse, as that was not considered when the price of taking the land for a highway was fixed; and although it is of little value without the franchise, yet the ownership of the land gives him the preferable right to call for the franchise when the ferry becomes necessary. This right is valuable, for, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, the sovereign must grant it to the owner, as sovereigns are bound to be just. * * * If it be asked, what is to be done if the owner of land, where a ferry is necessary, refuses to receive the franchise, it is answered, to pay him for the land and grant it to another. * * * Let it not be taken for a road and used as a ferry.’ It was accordingly held, that compensation must be made to the owner of the fee for the use of the soil for the ferry right, although there is a public road leading to the river on both sides.</p>

Thus in Chambers v. Furey, 1 Yeates (1792), 167, it was decided that the dedication or laying out of ground as a public road gave no right to the defendants, the owners of a ferry, to land upon or receive freight from the plaintiff’s freehold on the banks of a navigable river, without his consent. That the owner of a ferry has no right to land his passengers or boat on a public highway without the consent of the owner of the soil, see, also, Cooper v. Smith, 9 Sergeant <em>&amp; </em>Eawle, 31 (1822); not even (it was held in a subsequent case) at the terminus of a highway between high and low water mark. Chess v.

Davis, infra), for the purpose of fastening boats and of receiving and discharging freight and passengers. Such a use is not a public use, so much as it is a use by the licensee or holder of the franchise for his own gain and advantage. Like the use of an ordinary road for railway purposes, such a use for ferry purposes would be an additional burden or servitude, for which compensation must be made to the owner. Milburn v.
