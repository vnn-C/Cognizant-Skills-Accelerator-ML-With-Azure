Limited Excursion Railway Tickets — Reasonable Restrictions.—The rule is well settled, that the liability of a carrier by contract can be limited and confined to its own line of road. But when a railway company undertakes to sell an excursion ticket to be used within a certain time, it must see that the time agreed upon is reasonable, from the standpoint of the then existing circumstances and conditions, and that the passenger, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may complete his journey within the time agreed upon. If such time be reasonable, the railway company selling such ticket with liability <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>limited to its own line would not be liable for delay by other lines on the route, and could insist upon the terms of the ticket when presented after the time specified therein.</p>

In the nature of things, the ticket held by the passenger must be to the conductor the only evidence of the passenger’s right to transportation thereon. It would be an impracticable and unreasonable rule to require the conductor to enter into a judicial investigation on the train, to determine whether from matters de hors the ticket the passenger was entitled to transportation, notwithstanding the ticket on its face does not entitle the passenger to transportation thereon. Hence, under such circumstances, it is the duty of the passenger to pay fare, and to look to the party whose negligence may have rendered the ticket insufficient for any damages that may have been sustained.

It makes the appellant liable for delays occurring on lines of road other than its own. The rule is well settled in this State, that the liability of the carrier by contract can be limited and confined to its line of road. In cases of this kind, we believe the correct rule to be, that the carrier has the right to limit its liability to its own line, but when it undertakes to sell a ticket to be used within a certain time, it must see that the time agreed upon is reasonable from the standpoint of the then existing circumstances and conditions, and that the passenger, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may perform and complete his journey within the time agreed. A time fixed in which the ticket may be used, less than is sufficient to accomplish that purpose, would be a limitation of time imposed which could not be reasonable under the circumstances. Agreements of this character are permitted by the law upon the theory that they are reasonable. The carrier selling the ticket must know of the movements of the trains and their connections over the lines of road that it sells, and the difficulties naturally and <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>usually resulting in travel over those lines. This is necessarily so in determining if the time in which the passage is limited is reasonable. Whether the time in which a ticket is to be used is reasonable, is ascertained from all the facts and circumstances existing at the time the contract was made and the time the ticket should be used.</p>
    <p id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[253,591,1303,834]]]'>From these facts the jury must determine whether the limitation imposed was reasonable, and if the journey could, by ordinary diligence upon the part of the passenger, be accomplished within that period. In submitting the question to the jury, as to the liability of appellant for failure of the wife of appellee to reach the line of appellant’s road before the ticket expired, it should be in connection with a proper rule of law submitting to them the right to ascertain if, from the facts and circumstances, the time agreed upon was not reasonably sufficient for that purpose. If from the facts and circumstances existing at the time the contract of carriage was entered into, as to the connections and movements of the trains over the several lines of road, and reasonable changes that were likely to be made in the schedules of the movements of trains, and from the natural and usual difficulties that are likely to be inet by a traveller over the route, and that are of such a character that the carrier selling the ticket is likely to contemplate, the time agreed upon is not sufficient to accomplish the journey, it can then be said that the limitation imposed is unreasonable. 2 Woods Ry.

The appellee was permitted to testify, over the objection of the appellant, as to statements and representations made by the ticket agent of appellant when the ticket was purchased, as to the movement of trains over the route covered by the ticket, and the advice of such agent to purchase the ticket over those lines. We think this evidence was properly admitted. 2 Wood’s Ry. Law, 1395; Burham v. Railway, <a href="/me/63/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="63 Me. 298" data-case-ids="592799" data-case-paths="/me/63/0298-01">63 Me., 298</a>; Van Kirk v.

    <p id="b494-7" data-blocks='[["BL_494.7",494,[247,1783,1306,589]]]'>This fact was not necessary to be pleaded in order to admit the evidence. It was admissible in showing the knowledge of appellant as to the proper route to be travelled and as to the movements of the trains. While it is true the passenger should know of the movements of the trains over his intended line of travel, he is only required to obtain his information from some source that he can rely upon. We know of no more reliable source of information than the road that sells the ticket. .All this testimony was admissible upon the question as to whether the appellant had the opportunity to know if the time agreed upon in which the ticket should be used was unreasonable, and was further admissible in showing diligence upon the part of the purchaser of the ticket in ascertaining the movements of trains over the line called for by the ticket.</p>

The court did <em>not err </em>in refusing to give the special charge number 3 requested by appellant, to the effect, that “as between the conductor <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>and the passenger, the ticket was the only evidence of the right of the passenger to ride, and that the conductor was not required to enter into an investigation as to failure to present the ticket upon defendant’s line before its limitation had expired.”</p>
    <p id="b495-5" data-blocks='[["BL_495.5",495,[153,541,1301,1333]]]'>The passenger, when called upon for the extra fare, stated the reasons why she did not present the ticket before the three days expired in which it could be used. The effect of her statements tended to show, that she had used due diligence in her return trip, and that the time limited in the ticket was not sufficient for her to accomplish the journey. She had a right to rely upon the contract, and if from the facts and circumstances the time limited by the terms of the ticket for her to make the return trip was not a reasonable time for such purpose, the law would imply as one of the conditions of the contract that she should have a reasonable time in which to make and conclude the journey. This was a matter to be determined by the jury. She had the right to state the facts as she understood they were, and insist that her rights should be controlled by the contract as existed between her and appellant. She was under no obligation to pay another agent of appellant á sum in excess of that agreed upon with appellant as the amount stipulated for her transportation. When she stated to the conductor the facts tending to show that the time agreed upon was not reasonable, it was equivalent to an explanation made to appellant, and the appellant could no more justify the conduct of the conductor in exacting additional fare than it could a like exaction directly made by it. If in such a case the passenger should be right, the carrier can not exact the performance of conditions contrary to the rights of the passenger under the contract. It assumes the responsibility of any wrong it or its servants in authority may commit under the circumstances. Railway v.

In answer to the objection made to the charge, the appellee contends that if error was committed, it was abstract; because the ticket should be so construed that the passenger was only required to commence her journey within the three days after the ticket was officially signed and stamped, and was not required to complete it within that time, as the facts indisputably show that she did commence the journey within the three days.</p>
