Note of F. without security. <em>2. </em>Two notes of F. with S. and others as sureties thereon (judgment being also taken against said sureties). 3. A debt of F. paid by appellant and others as his sureties. The appeal bond was payable to appellee alone. <em>Held, </em>that the interests of S. and the other sureties on the two notes were adverse to those of appellant to the extent of the priority of the several liens; and as their interests might be affected by the judgment on this appeal, to which they are not parties, the appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>

    <p id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[290,423,897,38]]]'>First. The note of one Fleming, without security.</p>

    <p id="b124-8" data-blocks='[["BL_124.8",124,[248,717,1297,81]]]'>The record contains conclusions of law and fact and a statement of facts.</p>
    <p id="b124-9" data-blocks='[["BL_124.9",124,[243,818,1304,730]]]'>The sixth finding of fact, that the note upon which Silberberg <em>&amp; </em>Patton were sureties was secured by a lien on said land, appears to be unsustained by the statement of facts. This probaby resulted from an oversight in making up the statement of facts. If appellant had definitely assigned error upon the failure of the statement of facts to sustain the sixth finding of fact (of which he complains in his brief under a rather general assignment), it would have become necessary to either reform the judgment or remand the cause for a new trial, provided the appeal had been perfected so as to give this court jurisdiction. The appeal bond is payable to the Red River County Bank alone. It thus appears that the interests of Silberberg &amp; Patton might be affected by the judgment to be entered on this appeal, without their being before the court as parties to the appeal. Their interests, as well as the interests of O’Neil and others, are adverse to the interests of appellant to the extent of the priority of their several liens.</p>
