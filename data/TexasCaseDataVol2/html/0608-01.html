Telegraph Company—Stipulated Notice of Claim.—A message which was forwarded to plaintiff, but through negligence of the telegraph company never delivered, was written on a form containing a printed stipulation, that the.company will not be liable for damages in any case where the claim is not presented in writing within sixty days after sending the message.” Plaintiff did not learn of the message until about three weeks after it was sent. <em>Held, </em>that the court erred .in charging that plaintiff, for the purpose of giving the notice, was entitled to sixty days after he learned, or reasonably could have learned, that the message was sent. It should have been submitted to the jury to determine, under the facts of the case, whether the remaining time after plaintiff learned of the message was reasonably sufficient for him to have given the notice within the stipulated sixty days.</p>

For this error in the charge, the judgment of the court below must be reversed as to the Western Union Telegraph Company; and we believe no useful purpose could be subserved by a discussion of the other errors assigned by it, as they are not of a nature that will likely arise upon another trial.</p>

The act of Congress relied upon to sustain this contention is as follows: “ That the United States Circuit and District Courts for the Northern District of Texas, the Western District of Arkansas, and the District of Kansas, and such other courts as may be authorized by Congress, shall have, without reference to the amount in controversy, concurrent jurisdiction, over all controversies arising between said Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Eailway Company and the nations and tribes through whose territory said railway shall be constructed. Said courts shall have like jurisdiction, without reference to the amount in controversy, over all controversies arising between the inhabitants of said nations or tribes and said railway company; and the civil jurisdiction of said courts is hereby extended within the limits of said Indian Territory, without distinction as to citizenship of the parties, so far as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this act.” Without considering the validity of this act of Congress in any of its features, we are of opinion that there is nothing therein which seeks to give exclu<a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>sive jurisdiction to any of said courts, or to deprive any other court of any jurisdiction which it would otherwise have.

To support this view, the case of Morris v. Railway, 78 Texas, 17, is strenuously relied upon. In that case it will be noted that both parties were nonresidents of this State. In this case the appellant is a Texas corporation, and we see no good reason why the courts of this State should refuse relief even to a nonresident against it in a meritorious case; but in this case it is by no means clear that appellee has lost his citizenship in this State. It is true, he is residing in the Indian Territory, but lie went from this State, and he does not seem to have become a member of any of the Indian tribes by marriage, as in the Morris case. In the Morris case, the court below refused to entertain jurisdiction, and our Supreme Court sustained it in such refusal. In this case the court below assumed jurisdiction, and we see no good reason to question the validity of its judgment on account thereof. Should a citizen of some other State or country seek to hold the Western Union Telegraph Company (it not being a Texas corporation) in our courts upon a cause of action of this kind arising outside of this State, the Morris case would go far toward holding that the proper course would be for our courts to refuse to entertain jurisdiction of such case.</p>

Appellee’s right of action arose as well out of the contract made by said appellant to transmit and deliver said message, as it did out of the obligation incumbent upon it in the performance of its duties to the public, on receipt of the message, to transmit and deliver it with dispatch. We do not understand from the statement of facts that contracts of this kind are <em>illegal </em>in the Chickasaw Nation, in the sense of being prohibited by its laws; but the evidence only goes to the extent of showing that its courts have not been authorized to afford a remedy in such cases. If we should hold this contract illegal according to the laws of that Nation, we would, upon the same evidence, be required to hold all contracts made therein for the payment of money or the performance of obligations, except in a few specified cases, illegal. We believe that this has never been regarded as the law applicable to ordinary contracts <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>made in that country, and we would not feel authorized in so holding, except upon the clearest convictions of its correctness.</p>

The lex loci acts upon the right; the lex fori on the remedy.” This we understand to be the generally accepted doctrine. If then it be conceded that the laws of the Chickasaw Nation have application to others than its citizens, can it be said that the mere failure of their courts to be authorized to afford a remedy in such cases will deprive the injured party, in case of violation of a contract made therein, of all remedy everywhere ? We believe not, and that in such cases the injured party can enforce his rights according to the remedies provided by the country where the defendant may be found.</p>

Goode, 50 Arkansas, 156, and Holland v. Park, 7 Tennessee (Peck), 151, would seem to go far in this direction. We believe the most that can be said from the record in this case is, that the laws of the Chickasaw Nation fail to authorize its courts to furnish a remedy in such cases, and do not go to the extent of making it lawful for persons to be guilty of negligence in the performance of a duty imposed upon them by law therein.</p>

Railway, 61 Texas, 433, it is said: “ The rules governing suits arising out of torts committed in a locality other than the government where the redress is sought are about these, as deduced from the authorities upon the subject: Where the action is transitory, and is based on personal injuries recognized as such by universal law, the suit may be brought wherever the aggressor is found, irrespective of the provisions of the local law, or whether there be any law at all in force at the place where the wrong was committed.” Citing Rorer on Interstate Law, 154, 155. Without approving this statement of the law to the extent of holding that a cause of action in such cases would exist irrespective of the provisions of the local law, if the local law changed what is termed the universal law and made the act complained of lawful in that jurisdiction, we believe the rule laid down to be sound in cases where there is a simple failure to provide a remedy, without making the act lawful.</p>
