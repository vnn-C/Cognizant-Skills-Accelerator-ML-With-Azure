Contributory Negligence — Sufficient Allegations of.—Plaintiff sued appellant company for damages for depredations on his crops by stock, which entered his premises over the depot platform, which was partly within and partly outside his enclosure, and was not protected by cattle guard or otherwise. Defendant's plea of contributory negligence was, that the plaintiff, by building a few yards of fence around defendant’s passenger depot, could have prevented all the damages. This plea was good against a general demurrer, and the court below erred in striking it out on plaintiff’s exception.</p>

He could have repaired it, but did not. If it could have been repaired at a moderate cost, and the crops thereby protected, it was the plaintiff’s duty to have done so; and failing to do it, his measure of damages would be a sufficient amount of money to have made such repairs.</p>

The amount of damages is excessive and not supported by the evidence, in this: The amount of damages suffered by the plaintiff, as testified by himself, only amounted to 8660, and the court rendered judgment against the said defendant for 8700. Plaintiff alleged in his petition that his pasture was damaged 850, and testified that it was damaged $200 to 8300. Under his petition he was only entitled to recover 850 for said item; and if he were allowed the full amount of damages shown by his testimony on all other items testified to by him, he would only have been entitled to judgment for $410, while he received judgment for $700. 1 W. <em>&amp; </em>W.

Simonton brought this suit in the District Court of Montgomery County, against the Gulf, Colorado &lt;fe Santa Fe Railway Company, to recover damages for depredations upon his crops and premises by stock, which, as alleged in the petition, entered said premises through openings left by defendant in the construction of its railway.</p>
    <p id="b586-9" data-blocks='[["BL_586.9",586,[263,1726,1302,737]],["BL_587.1",587,[157,318,1304,685]]]'>There was no proof that stock entered by any other opening left by the defendant than over the platform of its depot building, which extended about four feet into plaintiff’s enclosure. With respect to this opening, after alleging that the company was operating its railway through the enclosed premises of plaintiff, consisting of about 200 acres of land, including farm, pasture, garden, truck patches, lawn, barns, lots, yard, residence, etc., all adjacent to the town of Montgomery, and had negligently and wrongfully torn down and destroyed and removed plaintiff’s fence; and having specified two other openings left unguarded, the petition averred, that “ another of said openings in plaintiff’s said fence and enclosure is where defendant company unlawfully and willfully tore down and removed plaintiff’s fence, and constructed and extended its depot platform from its depot on the outside of said enclosure to a point on the inside of said enclosure, and this place said defendant company did then negligently leave open, and has ever since negligently left open, an easy passage <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>way for stock of all kinds into said enclosed premises of plaintiff; and did then and there negligently fail and omit, and has ever since negligently failed and omitted, to guard or protect said place with a cattle guard, or hinder the invasion of said premises by stock through said openings;” and further averred, that by the construction of its depot platform into said enclosure from the outside, a broad, easy, and inviting opening was made into the premises for stock of all kinds, to-wit, “ a low, broad, flat structure, or apron walk, made of pine lumber, and not exceeding fourteen inches in heighth, upon which hogs and cattle and all other stock can and do easily enter and pass into said enclosure.” It was averred, that plaintiff had often requested the defendant to erect cattle guards and restore said fence, or to provide some adequate means or devices to protect his said farm and premises against the invasion and depredation of stock, invited and made easy by said openings.</p>

Exemplary damages were also claimed by reason of defendant’s alleged gross and willful negligence in failing after-repeated notices to fix the openings; but the portion of the petition setting up exemplary damages, on exception made by defendant, was stricken out by the court. Defendant pleaded also contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff, and want of due care. An exception in the nature of a general demurrer, made by the plaintiff to the plea of contributory negligence, was sustained by the court, and so much of the answer stricken out.</p>

The pleading does not advise us as to whether or not the plaintiff had a right to build the fence so as to close the passage over the platform, nor of other facts that might be pertinent to the inquiry as to whether or not the fence could have been built; but we are of opinion that it was good on general demurrer, and that the court erred in striking it out on plaintiff’s exception. As far as shown by the evidence, defendant’s plea of contributory negligence might have been good.</p>

But if we may assume that the back part of the platform extends about four feet into the pasture, that the building was constructed after the fence had been built, and that the track at this place lay outside the pasture, we do not think that the statute with reference to cattle guards would be applicable in such case.
