    <p id="b473-6" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[145,546,1303,234]]]'>There was no jury in the case, and the court rendered judgment against the plaintiff and also against the intervenors, and in favor of defendants as follows: Mrs. Mary S. Nuckols’ estate and Mrs. S. L. Jamison, one-half; E. Phelan, one-fourth; the Montgomerys, one-fourth; and for Ellis, and Baker, Phelan’s warrantors, for costs.</p>

    <p id="b473-8" data-blocks='[["BL_473.8",473,[144,844,1303,231]]]'>The title of the Dodge estate is founded upon a sale made in August,. 1861, by Thomas G. Masterson, as administrator of the estate of Green B. Jamison, and the first assignment of error challenges the correctness of the court’s ruling in holding that the letters of administration granted to said Masterson as administrator de bonis non of said estate were nullities.</p>
    <p id="b473-9" data-blocks='[["BL_473.9",473,[143,1093,1309,378]]]'>Green B. Jamison, to whom the certificate issued by virtue of which the land in controversy was patented, was killed at the Alamo in 1836, and between February, 1837, and July, 1840, three successive adminis-" trators of his estate had been appointed by the Probate Court of Brazoria County; and in May, 1841, Thomas B. Davis, the last of the three, reported to the court that he was unable to find any property belonging to the estate, and at his request his letters of administration were revoked and his bond cancelled.</p>
    <p id="b473-10" data-blocks='[["BL_473.10",473,[143,1492,1300,179]]]'>After the revocation of Davis’ letters of administration, no other order was made by said court in regard to the estate until the December Term, 1856, at which time Thomas G. Masterson was appointed administrator de bonis non of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b473-11" data-blocks='[["BL_473.11",473,[141,1691,1303,733]]]'>Under the laws in force from 1836 to 1846, the term of an administration was limited to one year only, but could, upon sufficient cause shown, be extended by the court from year to year, not exceeding five years. Davis, the last administrator before Masterson, was appointed in June, 1840. Under the law as it then existed, his administration would have terminated in June, 1841, unless an order was made continuing it another year. This was not done; but on the contrary, in May, 1841, his letters were revoked and his bond cancelled. If this last action of the court did not close the administration, then the failure to make an order continuing it after June, 1841, did close it; and -there being no administration pending in 1856, when Masterson was appointed administrator de bonis non, the action of the court appointing him was null and void. That the admistration had terminated, see, Flores v. Howth, 5 Texas, 329; Boyle v. Forbes, 9 Texas, 36; Murphy v. Menard, 14 Texas, 65; Portis v. Cummings, 14 Texas, 139.</p>

    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[272,438,1301,337]]]'>It is also contended, that Mary S. Nuckols was a party to the probate proceedings in which Masterson sold the certificate, and that she and those claiming under her are estopped. The evidence does not sustain this contention. It shows that Mary <em>Nichols </em>was represented in the partition proceedings by an attorney appointed by the court. But Nuckols and Nichols are not the same names. But if they were, the facts disclosed fall far short of an estoppel.</p>

    <p id="b474-8" data-blocks='[["BL_474.8",474,[271,1136,1296,435]]]'>It is shown, that in March, 1884, while Phelan in fact owned an undivided interest in the land, he entered into a lease contract with appellants for the whole of it for a term of three years, and agreed to surrender possession at the expiration of the lease. At the time of making the lease contract, appellants’ attorney told Phelan, that in his opinion the appellants’ title to the land was superior to the title Phelan had acquired from the heirs of Green B. Jamison. When the term of the lease ended, Phelan refused to surrender possession, and held the same for himself and as tenant of Mrs. S. L. Jamison and the estate of Mrs. Mary Nuckols.</p>
