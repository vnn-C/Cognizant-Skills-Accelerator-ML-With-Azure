The State having sued a purchaser for land for nonpayment of interest, S. intervened and claimed it as a bona fide settler, intending to purchase it for a homestead. His petition did not show that the land had ever been restored to the school fund by the filing of the copy of the judgment of forfeiture, nor that the lands were ever classified or appraised, nor that he had made application for the purchase of it. He only states that he was an actual settler thereon in good faith, with intent and purpose to make the land a homestead by purchase, and that he had tendered to the Treasurer one-fortieth of its value. The petition is fatally defective, and demurrer to it was rightly sustained.</p>

Right to Pay for School Land Purchased After Suit to Forfeit.—September 9,1892, the State sued Page, the purchaser, for the title and possession of a section of land he had purchased, upon the ground of nonpayment of purchase money. October 12,1892, the El Campo Land Company intervened, claiming to be the owners of the land by purchase from Page, and to have paid the balance of the purchase money and interest to the State. November 10, under instruction from the State Treasurer, notifying him of the payment of the full amount of the purchase money and interest, the case was discontinued by the district attorney, and judgment rendered in favor of the El Campo Company for title and possession. <em>Held, </em>failure to pay interest when due does not ipso facto work a forfeiture. We do not think that the statute does more than to require the payment of the money in the manner prescribed, before the ease has been called for trial.</p>
