    <p id="b547-6" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[167,1383,1299,883]]]'>Four errors are assigned. The first is that of the refusal of the court to grant a continuance of the cause. The application shows that the defendant had not attempted to obtain the testimony through legal process, and it avers, as the reason for not having used the statutory means for obtaining the desired testimony, that the witness was not then in the employment of defendant, and that his residence was.unknown to defendant, although defendant had used er cry means by telegraphing and writing to ascertain the whereabouts of the witness. It needs neither citation of authorities nor argument to show that such an application is insufficient for the purpose of showing proper diligence by defendant to find the witness. The defendant was cited to answer plaintiff’s suit on the 23d of April, 1891, and its motion for a continuance was made on the 19th of October of the same year. But the application does not inform the court when the witness left the employment of defendant; when the inquiries as to his residence were made by defendant; nor to whom, nor to what place or places, its letters or telegrams were directed. Nor does the application aver even a probability that the testimony can be had at some time in the future, not unreasonably distant. The motion was properly overruled.</p>
    <p id="b547-7" data-blocks='[["BL_547.6",547,[168,2278,1298,235]],["BL_548.1",548,[267,338,1300,486]]]'>Another error assigned is the refusal of the following charge requested by the defendant: “ You are charged, that though the defendant may be guilty of negligence in failing promptly to deliver the message to Dr. Fields, yet if the plaintiff could have obtained medical attention—if he could have gotten another doctor—and by his negligence failed to do so, <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>then yon will not find any damages for the plaintiff for the mental anguish suffered by him after the time he could have obtained such a doctor, as his omission to obtain such a doctor would have been contributory negligence on his part.” This charge is plainly upon the weight of the evidence, inasmuch as it assumes that the omission of the plaintiff to obtain another doctor, after the nonarrival of Dr. Fields on the morning train of the 12th of July, was per se contributory negligence. Whether any act or omission be negligence or not, unless it be so declared by law, is a question for the jury, which they must determine from the definition of negligence given them by the court, and the evidence before them.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[267,836,1298,236]]]'>The fourth assignment of error is: “ The judgment is contrary to the law and the evidence, because the damage sued for by the plaintiff was such as is known to the law as exemplary damages, and the plaintiff failed to allege and prove such facts as would enable him to recover exemplary damages against a corporation.”</p>
    <p id="b548-7" data-blocks='[["BL_548.6",548,[266,1084,1299,336]]]'>The plaintiff does not sue for exemplary damages.

    <p id="b548-8" data-blocks='[["BL_548.7",548,[264,1433,1300,635]]]'>The third assignment of error is, that the damages are excessive. The evidence shows that the telegram was received by the operator at Alvin sometime between 10 and 11 o’clock of the night of the 11th of July; that it was not delivered to Dr. Fields until 11 o’clock a. m. on the 12th; and that had it been delivered promptly the doctor would have reached the residence of plaintiff about 8 o’clock a. m. of the 12th, if not at an earlier hour of that day; that by his failure to receive the message he did not see plaintiff’s child until 8 o’clock p. m. of the same day; that the child was a sufferer all during that day, with no physician upon attendance to alleviate its pain; and it shows also that the father suffered much distress on account of the child and Ms failure to procure the services of a doctor for it, and that the child died some twenty hours after the arrival of the physician.</p>

The evidence also shows, that the plaintiff could have had but little reason to expect Dr. Fields to reach his house earlier than the hour for the arrival of the train from Alvin, which hour was 8 o’clock a. m., so that the time between the expected and the actual arrival of the doctor was 12 hours.</p>
    <p id="b549-4" data-blocks='[["BL_549.4",549,[150,585,1303,534]]]'>The plaintiff, it must be borne in mind, is not suing for the recovery of damages for the death of his child, but for damages founded upon the alleged mental anguish suffered by him between the time when the doctor should have arrived and the time when he did arrive. The question is, therefore, Are the damages under the evidence excessive ? The law, it is true, has not fixed any rule for measuring damages in such cases, and the measure of the damages rests in the discretion of the jury. But this is a judicial discretion, to be exercised by the jury without bias or prejudice to either party; and if there be evidence in the case which makes it probable that the minds of the jury were warped by passion in reaching their conclusion, the verdict should be set aside.</p>
    <p id="b549-5" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[149,1131,1301,1033]]]'>If the plaintiff might have procured the services of another physician at an earlier hour than that at which the child was first seen by Dr. Fields, as is insisted by appellant plaintiff could have done, the failure of plaintiff to do this would not bar his claim for damages. Such failure or neglect of the parent would not be contributory negligence, in the sense at least to relieve the appellant of negligence in failing to deliver the message within a reasonable time after it was received at Alvin. But if it be a fact that the parent might have procured another physician to minister to his child between the hours of the arrival of the morning train from Alvin and the hour of Dr. Fields’ arrival, such fact should be considered by the jury in fixing the measure of damages. If another physician could have and had been obtained, the duration of plaintiff’s anguish would have been necessarily shortened; and if he would have been subjected to mental suffering for want of a physician only between the arrival of the morning train from Alvin and the hour when the physician from Stafford would have arrived, then surely plaintiff should not recover damages for the whole time between the expected and the actual arrival of Dr. Fields; for it is not alleged, nor can we presume such to be the fact, that the plaintiff reposed special confidence in the skill of Dr. Fields, and that his grief was that the service of this particular physician could not be had for the suffering child.</p>
    <p id="b549-6" data-blocks='[["BL_549.6",549,[149,2176,1300,137]]]'>In view of the whole evidence, we are of the opinion that it is probable that sympathy for the parent influenced the jury in fixing the damages, and that the damages are excessive.</p>
    <p id="b549-7" data-blocks='[["BL_549.7",549,[151,2325,1299,79]]]'>The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the cause is remanded for another trial.</p>
