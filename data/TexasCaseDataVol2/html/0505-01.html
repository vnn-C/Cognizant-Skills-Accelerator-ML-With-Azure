Defendant answered that he would sell on terms proposed. Plaintiff to that replied that she would take the land, but wanted a sketch of it prepared to be attached to the contract, and time to investigate title; and defendant replied that before closing the contract he wanted a survey made. There is no pretense that plaintiff accepted in writing, and the acceptance of such an offer to sell land must be in writing.</p>

Same—Case Followed.—Where the writing relied on contains within itself all the particulars of a concluded contract, it is sufficient if it be signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced; but if instead of being evidence of a concluded agreement, whatever its form, it is really a mere proposal, such writing is turned into an agreement, and can be enforced in equity by the other party only by his acceptance of it in writing.

Sucker, 29 Texas, 402-408, where it is said: <em>“ </em>In order to their enforcement by the courts, contracts for the sale of lands must be evidenced by writing. Where the writing relied on contains within itself all the particulars of a concluded contract, it is sufficient, if it be signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced; but if, instead of being evidence of a concluded agreement, whatever may be its form, it is really a mere proposal, such a writing is turned into an agreement, and can be enforced in equity by the other party only by his acceptance of it in writing.”</p>

    <p id="b540-9" data-blocks='[["BL_540.9",540,[273,1540,1302,386]]]'>The first case was a suit on a note which was a contract complete in itself; and in the last, the offer and acceptance were both in writing. So that the question herein involved was neither, presented nor discussed. These, and the case of Morris v. Gaines, 82 Texas, 255, are based upon facts which show either a writing signed by the party to be charged, evidencing an undertaking complete in itself and not dependent on a subsequent acceptance to conclude the contract, or else an offer made and accepted in writing.</p>
    <p id="b540-10" data-blocks='[["BL_540.10",540,[271,1937,1301,386]]]'>There was no complete contract in this case without acceptance of the offer. The decision in Patten v. Bucker holds, that in such cases the acceptance must be in writing in order to complete the contract. That case involved a discussion and decision of the question, for there was a verbal acceptance of the offer to sell conclusively shown. The court virtually held that insufficient, and then decided that the writing relied on was sufficient. We do not think that the passage which we have quoted can be treated by us as a mere dictum.</p>
    <p id="b540-11" data-blocks='[["BL_540.11",540,[273,2334,1297,140]],["BL_541.1",541,[184,350,1301,681]]]'>But there is a further objection to the alleged acceptance in this case. There was no offer to show that Whitty had any authority to bind the company, and there was positive evidence that he had none. An accept<a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>anee, to bind the company, must therefore have been communicated to those officers who had such authority. The telegram relied on from Whitty to Langerman stated that plaintiff would take the land, agreeably to proposed terms, but referred to a letter, evidently for fuller expression. That letter repeated the statement, that plaintiff was willing to take the land, but added that she wished a sketch of it prepared, to be attached to the contract, and that she would have her first payment ready in about a week; “that is, she wants to take a few days to satisfy herself about the title.” The letter and telegram must be taken together, and must evidence an unconditional acceptance of the offer. Instead of that, they seem to suggest a modification of the terms of the trade, in asking time in which to make a payment which was to be made in cash, and in which to satisfy herself of the soundness of the title. See Corcoran v. White, <a href="/ill/117/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="117 Ill. 118" data-case-ids="2893485" data-case-paths="/ill/117/0118-01">117 Ill., 118</a>.</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[186,1044,1299,485]]]'>An acceptance, to complete a contract, must be the unconditional and absolute agreement to the very terms of the offer. This letter suggested modifications which necessitated further negotiations and further agreements. This is rendered evident by the reply of the company to this letter, in which the following language occurs: “Before closing this contract, we would like to have Mr. G-iraud’s survey made, and I write to him to-day. I hope we can have him go down there after New Tear. This will also give Mrs. Foster time to have our title investigated. As she wishes to cut up the land into small tracts, we can not afford to make the contract before we know just how our lands lie.”</p>
    <p id="b541-6" data-blocks='[["BL_541.6",541,[185,1542,1299,434]]]'>It appears from the correspondence, that the completion of the contract was deferred on both sides. Mrs. Foster, according to Whitty’s letter, asks for time to satisfy herself about the title, and the company wants to have a survey made before making the contract. It seems to us that the parties up to this point were negotiating, and that their minds did not meet in a binding contract, on the part of the seller to sell, and the buyer to buy, in presentí and unconditionally. The expressions used indicate that they intended to close the trade by a full contract when the necessary preliminaries were settled.</p>
    <p id="b541-7" data-blocks='[["BL_541.7",541,[184,1988,1299,278]]]'>The expression of willingness on the part of Mrs. Foster to take the land may be interpreted, in connection with all the letter contains, to mean that she was willing to so take it when she should have satisfied herself of the title and prepared herself to make the first payment. The company was authorized to put that interpretation on it, and evidently did so.</p>
    <p id="b541-8" data-blocks='[["BL_541.8",541,[184,2285,1300,187]],["BL_542.1",542,[257,341,1298,436]]]'>The obstacle here presented to plaintiff’s right to recover is not merely that she did not perform the contract, but that she did not accede to the proposition in a binding way. The plaintiff, after having introduced these letters in evidence, offered to show, that in her conversation with <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>Whitty she stated that she accepted the offer unconditionally, and did not authorize Whitty or any one to change it, and that knowledge of her acceptance in this manner was brought home to defendant company immediately thereafter. But there was no claim that any other communication was made to the company than the written ones in evidence. But it was stated that there was no other documentary evidence. If there was any evidence in the possession of plaintiff showing such communication, it should, in view of all that had been offered, have been specifically pointed out to the court.</p>
    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[254,788,1301,684]]]'>Plaintiff further offered to show on this point, 11 that the defendant company, with the knowledge brought home to its officers at Austin, permitted the plaintiff Mrs. Foster to go ahead and sell portions of the land as belonging to her under this contract, and that she actually made such contracts for sale. That in pursuance of this contract of sale the defendant company ordered a survey of the land to be made, in order to ascertain the exact number of acres embraced in the contract, and for which plaintiff was to pay S3 per acre. * * * That until the completion of the survey and the tender to Mrs. Foster on the 27th day of February, 1890, of the instrument described in appendix B, the defendant company permitted Mrs. Foster to believe that she had contracted for and was to have all the unsold land referred to in the said correspondence, the same embracing the twenty-five sections of land set forth in the exhibit attached to plaintiff’s petition.”</p>
    <p id="b542-7" data-blocks='[["BL_542.6",542,[254,1483,1300,380]]]'>On this point the defendant’s agent, Whitty, testified: “ I handed the letter to Mrs. Foster at the time [referring to the letter No. 2a above]. She stated that she would take the lands on those terms. Nothing was said as to when the first payment was to be made. She came around several times to make inquiries about the land, and as to when the surveys would be completed and when ready. I never told her that any of the twenty-five sections had been sold, because I did not know that any of them had been sold.”</p>
    <p id="b542-8" data-blocks='[["BL_542.7",542,[256,1881,1299,390]]]'>It is contended by plaintiff in error, that these facts were sufficient to show, not only that she had accepted, but that the company knew and recognized the fact, and that this cured any ambiguity which there might have been in the letter as to acceptance. No act of the company is here stated by which permission to sell was given to plaintiff. What it did and what plaintiff did, as represented in the bill of exceptions, is consistent with the contention of either party, and adds nothing to the effect of the alleged acceptance in the telegram and letter.</p>
