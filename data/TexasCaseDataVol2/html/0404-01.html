Defendant Wimberly recognized the change made by the court, and apportioned the pro rata of the school fund for the children residing on the Lewis survey to district number 2.

The evidence objected to did not tend to contradict the record, but was simply explanatory of it. The minutes of the court for that day simply showed that three commissioners, naming them, were present, but did not say that any one else required by law as necessary to constitute a part of the court was not present. The failure of the record of the proceedings of the Commissioners Court to state that the county judge Was present was evidently an oversight of the clerk in preparing the minutes of the court. The evidence was properly admitted. The county judge being present with the three commissioners, constituted a full court for the transaction of business as required by law.</p>
