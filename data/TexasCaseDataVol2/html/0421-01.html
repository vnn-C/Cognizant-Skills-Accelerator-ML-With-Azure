Hill executed a deed of trust upon certain real and personal property, to secure certain notes due by him to the San Angelo National Bank. At the maturity of the indebtedness, the property was advertised and about to be sold, and to prevent this Hill applied to J. H. Glass, of San Antonio, Texas, for relief, and agreed to pay him a.commission of $150 for his services in connection with securing him the loan, and further agreed that this additional sum due as commissions should be secured as the other indebtedness, and paid out of the proceeds of the sale under the deed of trust. The notes were transferred to Glass, and extended for Hill’s accommodation. Subsequently a substituted trustee, Hill again defaulting in payment, advertised the property under the deed of trust, and sold it. The cash was paid for the personal property, but P. J. Willis, who bought the real estate, failed to pay for it at the time. This sale occurred September 27, 1887. Thereafter, this real estate was again advertised to be sold on the 18th day of October, 1887, but before the sale Willis paid the purchase money for a part of the land bought by him at <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>the first sale, and the remainder, which is the land in controversy, was again sold and purchased by Frank Lerch, one of the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[154,426,1305,382]]]'>In the original petition filed by J. H. Hill November 11, 1887, he made P. J. Willis and Frank Lerch defendants, and sought to set aside the two sales referred to above; and for grounds of vacating the first, of date September 27, alleged, that he was unable to attend on account of sickness, but before it was made he caused a tender to be made of all moneys due, including the costs, and that the property was not advertised a sufficient length of time under the deed of trust, and for these reasons the sale was void.</p>
    <p id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.6",449,[157,826,1300,136]]]'>The second sale, of date October 18, was also attacked, on the grounds that it was not sufficiently advertised, and because, as alleged, the proceeds of the first sale had satisfied all demands against the property.</p>
    <p id="b449-7" data-blocks='[["BL_449.7",449,[156,973,1303,488]]]'>Thus the case stood, with J. H. Hill as plaintiff and the said P. J. Willis and Frank Lerch as defendants, until November 16, 1888, when D. H. and J. W. Snyder filed what is styled their petition of intervention, in which they make no complaint againt P. J. Willis, but sue Frank Lerch, and join therein Otto Lerch as a defendant. In this plea of intervention the original sale, of date September 27, is treated and considered as valid and regular in all respects, but they attacked the second sale as void ab initia upon two grounds: (1) That the sale was not advertised the requisite length of time under the deed of trust. (2) The first sale satisfied the debt secured by the deed of trust and the cost and expenses.</p>
    <p id="b449-9" data-blocks='[["BL_449.8",449,[156,1474,1303,335]]]'>These intervenors set out as the basis of their right to intervene, that the original plaintiff, J. H. Hill, had executed a certain instrument to one of them, John W. Snyder, whereby these lands, with others, were conveyed to said Snyder to secure said intervenors in certain indebtedness due them by said Hill, and to indemnify them for certain liabilities incurred by them for said Hill. Said instrument is set out in full as an exhibit to said petition of intervenors.</p>

H. and J. W. Snyder, which were overruled and exceptions taken; and also pleaded that the original sale of September 27 was properly advertised, and did not satisfy the deed of trust, expenses, costs, etc., and the second sale was in all respects regular and valid, and passed the title. Also, that the defendants were innocent purchasers of the land for a valuable consideration, without notice of any irregularities and defects, if there were any, etc.</p>

H. Hill to D. H. and J. W. Snyder, is simply a deed of trust or mortgage, with power of sale, and does not confer upon the Snyders such interest in the land as would permit them to maintain this action. We think the deed of trust is broad enough in its terms to confer upon the Snyders the authority to make the transfer of the property to the intervenor the Park Land and Cattle Company, and in permitting them to remove cloud from the title and to cancel sales affecting the title, as could have been done by Hill himself, if he had insisted upon his rights in this case. The instrument authorizes the Sny<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>ders to take full possession and control of the lands; to sell the same at public or private sale, for cash or on time, and for such sums and in such manner as they may see fit; to do any and everything with regard thereto as if his own individual property; to make good and warranty deeds thereto. In accomplishing these purposes, Snyder had the right, in order to put him in a position to do the very acts and to perform the powers conferred upon him by the instrument, to have cancelled and set aside any adverse title that may have been a hindrance in the performance of these duties.</p>
    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[247,781,1299,686]]]'>The second question presented by appellants is, that it does not appear from the pleadings or from the evidence that a tender was made by the appellees of the amount of purchase money paid by appellants at the trustee’s sale under which they hold. Reimbursing the appellants was not a duty required of the appellees as a predicate to maintaining this action and in obtaining the relief granted by the trial court. The sale made by the trustee was absolutely void. The Snyders had no interest in that matter, excepting so far as that sale may have been a cloud upon their title. Their interest was adverse to that of appellants, or that of any one else which tended to affect the title asserted by the Snyders. No obligation was resting upon the Snyders’, as a prerequisite to the right of attacking this adverse title, that they should discharge any claim that the appellants might have against J. H. Hill or Glass, to recover from them the price that the)r had paid for property of which they received no title.</p>
    <p id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[242,1480,1302,835]]]'>The third question presented is, was the sale to appellants under the deed of trust under which they claim void ? The deed of trust required the land to be sold after advertisement of ten days in some newspaper published in Tom Green County. The evidence shows, that the first publication was made on the 8th of October, 1887, and the sale was made on the 18th of October, 1887. It is apparent from this statement that the sale was not advertised for the length of time required b)1- the terms of the deed of trust. The requirement of the law on the question of time, as shown by the facts of this case, is ten full days. The sale made upon the 18th would not be ten full days, because the day upon which the advertisement is first published is to be excluded in computing the time when the publication begins. The court below held the sale void for this reason, and also for the further reason that the debts secured by the deed of trust under which appellants claim had previously been paid and satisfied. Holding as we do, that the sale was void because not advertised for the length of time required by the deed of trust, it is not necessary for us to pass upon the other reason given the court below for holding the sale void.</p>
    <p id="b452-7" data-blocks='[["BL_452.7",452,[284,2327,802,37]]]'>The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>
