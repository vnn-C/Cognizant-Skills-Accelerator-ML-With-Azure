      <em>Conclusions of </em>Lato.—Under the foregoing facts, we concur with the trial court, that the Boatman Savings Bank was subrogated, as regards the judgments against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond, to the rights of the original owners of those judgments, Henderson, Dabbs, and others, principals in the main judgment, and of Rollins, the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, and others who were sureties therein. Coleb. on Coll. Secur., secs. 217, 212. These collateral judgments against Smith and others were held by the Boatman Savings Bank as a pledge to secure the payment of the original judgment against Dabbs and others. As a pledge, they were an incident to the debt evidenced by the main judgment, and were so transferable with the latter. Coleb. on Coll. Secur., sec. 79, p. 107; Freem. on Judg., sec. 431; The Batesville Inst. v. Kaufman, <a href="/us/85/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="18 Wall., 151" data-case-ids="3427205" data-case-paths="/us/85/0151-01">18 Wall., 151</a>.</p>
    <p id="b712-8" data-blocks='[["BL_712.8",712,[275,1466,1303,934]]]'>We fail to appreciate the distinction, in this respect, sought to be drawn by appellants’ counsel between a pledge and a mortgage. The thing pledged ,• in its character as a security, is as much an incident of the debt intended thereby to be secured as would be a mortgage. The transfer of the main judgment to Smith operated as a transfer of the collateral, and going thus hand in hand, so to speak, the latter, to the extent of the former, must be held to have operated as a cancellation of the former. Otherwise it will have altogether lost its character as a pledge for the former. It is not to be questioned, that had Smith paid to the Boatman Savings Bank the amount of the collateral judgments against himself, such payment would to the extent thereof have discharged the main judgment. Unless the converse be true, the purpose with which the Boatman Savings Bank held the collateral judgments would be defeated, and Dabbs, with the remaining principals, and the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company and the remaining sureties on the main judgment, would be deprived of all benefit from the collateral held for them by the Boatman Savings Bank. It would seem that payment, under such circumstances, of the one judgment would operate pro tanto to extinguish the others, and vice versa. Freem. on Judg., sec. 467.</p>
    <p id="b712-9" data-blocks='[["BL_712.9",712,[277,2411,1296,90]],["BL_713.1",713,[130,321,1305,1034]]]'>When Smith took a transfer from the Boatman Savings Bank of the judgment against Dabbs, Henderson, and others as principals, and the <a id="p687" href="#p687" data-label="687" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*687</a>Stone Cattle and Pasture Company as endorsers, it can not be so accurately said that he purchased the judgment as that he paid it. And this is true, because he owed the amount which he paid; not indeed for the reason that he was directly a party to the judgment which was transferred to him, but for the reason that he was a debtor in two judgments held by the transferrer as a security and a pledge for the judgment transferred, and that as between himself and the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company he was primarily liable. His obligations, reduced to judgments, were held by the Boatman Savings Bank as a security for the obligation of Dabbs and of the cattle company which he purports to have purchased. When he, with J. D. Reed and E. G-. Thurmond, executed the notes on which were founded the judgments against him, he contracted that these notes might be assigned by their holders as a pledge or security for any debt which might be due by them. He must be held then to have contracted for their payment in contemplation of the fact that they might or would be assigned to the Boatman Savings Bank (as to any other person, natural or artificial), to whom their payees might become indebted. He is not, under the facts stated, to be regarded as occupying the attitude of a stranger, taking as such an assignment of the judgment. He did not <em>purchase </em>it; he <em>paid </em>it. Otherwise the very purpose for which his primary obligations had been legitimately pledged would be defeated.</p>
    <p id="b713-5" data-blocks='[["BL_713.5",713,[135,1367,1302,535]]]'>It can not be said that this interpretation of the transaction produces a result which will operate as a hardship upon Smith. The money paid by him upon the principal judgment will have been applied to the payment of his own obligations, and in a manner which might be considered as within his contemplation at the time he bound himself by the promissory notes afterwards pledged to secure the debt of their holders. The latter will have secured the benefit of the collateral securities, legitimately obtained and pledged by them to the payment of their obligation; and the Boatman Savings Bank, the pledgee, will have collected the amount justly due it. Thus, ‘ ‘ all things ’ ’ between the several parties 11 will have been made even,” and the behests of equity fully subserved.</p>
    <p id="b713-6" data-blocks='[["BL_713.6",713,[137,1914,1301,335]]]'>The fact, insisted upon by appellant, that at the time of the transfer by the Boatman Savings Bank to Smith the latter held other notes of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, does not affect the conclusion above expressed. These notes can not, as we think, be used to thus defeat the specific purpose with which the judgments against Smith were pledged, not only in the interest of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, but also of its cosureties and others, principals in the main judgment.</p>
    <p id="b713-7" data-blocks='[["BL_713.7",713,[138,2261,1300,236]]]'>The further fact which appellants sought to prove, that in 1888, F. M. Daugherty, assignee (subject to the rights of the Boatman Savings Bank) of the collateral judgments, brought suit against Smith to revive these judgments, is alike, in our opinion, immaterial. That suit and the issues therein involved must be regarded as “ res inter alios acta.”</p>

      <a id="p688" href="#p688" data-label="688" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*688</a>Nor do we find merit in the contention of appellants against the admissibility of the testimony of the witness Rollins, wherein he refers to the notes against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond, giving the names of those who signed them, and stating their date and amounts and the particular notes on which the judgments against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond were rendered. The character of these notes as pledges was the issuable fact in this connection. This fact rested in paroi. It could not be otherwise proved, because it did not otherwise exist. The notes themselves were merged in judgments and the judgments were read in evidence. We do not think that it was improper that the witness should be permitted, in explanation of this issuable fact, to state, without producing the notes themselves, the date and amount thereof and the names of the signers, and to trace them to the judgments, which were themselves introduced. This testimony seems to us to have been but collateral to the main issue. 1 Greenl., sec. 89.</p>

As in our opinion the judgment on which this sale rested had been by Smith, in the manner above indicated; paid off and satisfied, there was then and is now no basis for appellants’ title.</p>
