This rendition was made out at Austin, and forwarded to the assessor by mail, who, upon receipt of same, notified appellant’s said agents that this valuation was too low, and would be referred by him to the board of equalization. On the 27th of June the board of equalization of Stonewall County raised the valuation of this land from $1 to $3.50 per acre. Prior to this, on the 27th of May, 1889, the Commissioners Court of said county met as a board of equalization and ordered the clerk to give, ten days notice of the sitting of the board, and the clerk, in obedience to said order, in person posted one notice at the court house door of Stonewall County, but did not post such notices in each justice’s precinct in said county. Said, clerk also mailed to Thomson <em>&amp; </em>Donnan a written notice that the board of equalization desired to raise the valuation of said land so rendered by them for appellant, but he did not issue notices in the name of the State of Texas, directed to the sheriff or any constable of Travis County, Texas, or any other constable or sheriff of the State, citing Thomson &amp; Donnan to appear before the said board to show cause why the rendition of S. M. Swenson’s property should not be raised, as it is contended is required by article 1531, 1 Sayles’ Civil Statutes. The board raised the valuation-above set forth without hearing any evidence as to the value of the land, but acted upon their own knowledge in fixing its value.</p>

Peeler, 74 Texas, 268, it is held, that until a tax payer has exhausted the legal remedy thus given, the courts should refuse him the equitable remedy by injunction, .and in that opinion it is said: “ This is a broad statute, and covers errors in valuation as well as all others.” And again: “The petition failing to show that appellee had been denied this plain remedy, existing <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>when this suit was brought, or that for some reason it was inadequate,, was fatally defective and should have been so held.”</p>

Though a statute directs a thing to be done at a particular time, it does not necessarily follow that it may not be done afterwards. In other words, as the cases universally hold, a statute specifying a time within which a public officer is to perform a final act regarding the rights and duties of others is directory, unless the nature of the act to be performed, or the phraseology of the statute is such that the designation of time must be considered as a limitation of the power of the officer.” And again, in section 450: “ The assessors of a school district were directed by statute to assess the district tax within thirty days after the clerk had certified the vote for raising the tax, and it was held to be merely directory, as there were no negative words in the statute limiting their power to make the assessment afterwards.” Such we believe to be the general rule (Flatan v. The State, 56 Texas, 93), and we see nothing in this statute which requires a different construction to be placed upon it. We find no negative words in this provision; and in view of the fact that at the time of its passage many of the counties in this State were unorganized, and could not comply therewith within the time named, it would be unreasonable to hold that such counties were intended to be deprived of all benefit to be derived from our district school system. We are of opinion that the <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>action of the Commissioners Court in subdividing Stonewall County into" school districts in 1889 was legal.</p>

Upon its face the notice appeared to be only the act of the county judge.</p>
    <p id="b361-6" data-blocks='[["BL_361.6",361,[177,936,1300,884]]]'>Mr. Cooley, in his work on Taxation, section 335, in speaking of these special elections to vote taxes, says: “All special meetings must be regularly called as the statute may have prescribed, for no one is under obligation to pay heed to any but the legal notice, and those who come together in pursuance of any other do not, for legal purposes, represent the electors. The following are customary regulations: That the meeting shall be called by the officers of the municipality, either on their own motion or on the application of a certain number of the voters or freeholders; that it shall be notified either by a warning delivered or its contents stated to the several voters, or by notice published or posted in a manner particularly indicated by the statute; and that the subjects to be considered at the meeting shall be specified in the warning or notice. With all these provisions there must be careful compliance, and the meeting when held must confine itself strictly to the subjects indicated in the notice or warning.” To sustain this a great number of cases are cited, in a number of which it is held, that a school district tax voted at a meeting not legally called is void. To the same effect is 2 Desty on Taxation, 1126 to 1133; also, see Reynolds Land and Cattle Company v. McCabe, 72 Texas, 57.</p>
    <p id="b361-8" data-blocks='[["BL_361.7",361,[178,1831,1297,426]]]'>We are therefore of opinion that the irregularities attending the ordering and giving of the notice of this election as above indicated renders the tax voted thereat illegal and void. It will be noted one of the provisions of the statute requires, that “the Commissioners Court shall order the sheriff to give notice of such election by posting three notices in the district for three weeks before the election, and the sheriff shall obey such order,” and no authority is given the county judge to give such notice, and we are of opinion that the tax payers were not called upon to assemble at his call.</p>

Davis, 57 Texas, 225, and Dwyer v. Hackworth, 57 Texas, 245), we are nevertheless of the opinion that the action of the court was correct. If it be desired to show that a certain instrument does not appear of record in a county, it has been held, that the proper practice is to have the custodian of the record make a careful examination, and then prove by him as a witness this fact (Edwards v. Barwise, 69 Texas, 84); and we believe the same rule should apply where it is sought to prove that a name does not appear upon the tax rolls. It would seem to be impracticable to have the entire tax roll introduced in evidence, and the jury required to search through it to see if the name appears thereon.</p>
