That in the meantime Brooks and Penn had made a contract of sale of the lots to William R. Emery and John A. W.

Refusal by defendants to pay any part of the amount is alleged, wherefore plaintiff prays for judgment, etc., according to the liabilities set out.</p>

It could not be held that plaintiff would be compelled to sue the principals for the $250 or 8500 in the County Court, and after judgment sue the guarantor in the Justice Court. Even when a counter-claim is set up which exceeds the jurisdiction of the court, it controls jurisdiction, and the court can not act. 1 W. &amp; W. C. C., sec. 273.</p>

Without dispute, the evidence shows that the transfer and guaranty were genuine and for a valuable consideration, and though the object, in part, was to give jurisdiction to Williamson County, the transfer being valid and binding, therefore was not a fraud upon the court’s jurisdiction.</p>

The deed sent by Turner to Huff to deliver to Brooks and Penn states as a consideration substantially the same terms as the receipt given by Huff, which shows that he had consented to the sale made by Huff. The deed was not different in any material respect from the receipt. Turner directed his agent to insert in the notes an additional obligation of the payees to pay attorney fees in case of suit on the notes, which was done, <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>and Brooks and Penn offered to comply, but the agent refused, because of a maturity clause in the notes different from the receipt.</p>
    <p id="b482-5" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[253,416,1306,436]]]'>But apart from this, Turner would be liable for the amount paid to Huff, if in fact there was no assent of the parties to the contract. The fact that there was no assent to the contract, or, in other words, that there was no consummation of the contract upon the terms proposed by either side, would furnish the best reason why Turner should not keep the money of Brooks and Penn. The evidence does not explain why he allowed his agent to retain one-half of this payment, nor does it show that he did not know the agent had received the amount. His receiving the money bound him to return it, if there was no assent to the contract.</p>
    <p id="b482-6" data-blocks='[["BL_482.6",482,[252,864,1304,487]]]'>There was no error in allowing plaintiff to prove that he and Penn, during the time the sale was pending, sold the lots for $3000, a profit of $250. The evidence was not offered to recover profits, and was not admissible for that purpose, there being no allegation of such damages, and the proof failing to show that Turner knew of such sale, though Huff is shown to have known it. The testimony was offered, and was legitimate, upon the question of the value of the lots. The measure of damage for the breach of the contract was the difference in the value and the price to be paid by Brooks and Penn. The jury only allowed about $50 as damages for the breach of the contract, not the profits lost.</p>
    <p id="b482-7" data-blocks='[["BL_482.7",482,[248,1363,1304,685]]]'>We do not find that there was reversible error in the court’s charge directing the jury to find for plaintiff the $250 paid Huff in any event. Under the facts, the charge was proper. There is no doubt but that Turner and Huff refused to comply with the contract made by Huff as Turner’s agent when he received the money—refused by adding obligations to the agreement not in the contract with Huff; there is no doubt but that Brooks and Penn offered full compliance according to that original contract, which was rejected. This breach of the contract, or failure to fully consent to it, and his stipulating other onerous terms, gave Brooks and Penn the right to declare the original contract at an end, and gave them the right to decline making the contract as proposed, in which case they were entitled to at least the amount of money advanced on the original contract. Had this been the only question, the court should have directed the jury to find for the plaintiff the amount paid.</p>
