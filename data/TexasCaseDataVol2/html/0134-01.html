This deed contained the further recital that, “my husband, C. M. Byars, having left and abandoned me, and now being absent from the State, having been away for months, I make this quitclaim and release as the remaining manager of the community property, and to further protect its interest.” In other respects, it was a quitclaim deed in the usual form, reciting only the considerations above specified.</p>

M. Byars, in the District Court of Galveston County for over $4000, should also be considered settled on that day and by the agreement then entered into, and that thereafter said Diehl would mark the same satisfied on the record of said suit in Galveston County.</p>

    <p id="b162-7" data-blocks='[["BL_162.7",162,[250,871,1306,436]]]'>The testimony, however, does not seem to have been admitted upon this ground; and the court in the charge did not submit that issue to the-jury, but instructed them that if at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed from M. A. Byars to plaintiffs below, it was understood and agreed by both deféndant and plaintiff’s agent, George Diehl, that the deed should be accepted by plaintiffs in full satisfaction and payment of said judgment, and that said Diehl had authority to settle said judgment, that they should find in favor of appellee upon that issue. This charge is also complained of by appellants.</p>
    <p id="b162-8" data-blocks='[["BL_162.8",162,[250,1320,1303,287]]]'>The first contention of appellee, in support of the action of the court, is, “Where written instruments form a part of"a more comprehensive transaction, the terms of which are not attempted to be expressed in writing, paroi evidence as to such parts of the transaction as were not reduced, to writing is admissible;” citing the case of Thomas v. Hammond, 47 Texas, 54, and other cases.</p>
    <p id="b162-9" data-blocks='[["BL_162.9",162,[248,1621,1306,636]]]'>These cases announce the correct rule where no attempt is made to reduce the more comprehensive agreement to writing. That, in our opinion, is not this case. Here the parties undertook with care to reduce to writing an agreement comprehending several different transactions. The agreement on its face appears to be complete. As to whether there was- or was not at the time, as a part of the settlement, an additional verbal agreement to satisfy the original judgment, the statements of the witnesses-for appellants and appellee were in sharp contradiction. To prevent such a result is evidently one of the objects of the rule which holds the writing to contain the entire agreement where on its face it appears to be, though not in fact, complete, and it is not shown that this appearance of completeness results from fraud, accident, or mistake. Belcher v. Mulhall &amp; Scaling, 57 Texas, 18, and cases there cited.</p>

This proposition seems to have been decided against appellee by us at a former <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>day of this term in the following cases: Weaver v. The City of Gainesville (1 Texas Civil Appeals, 286), and Rubrecht v. Powers (Id., 282).</p>
    <p id="b163-5" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[143,429,1300,289]]]'>Our construction of the written instruments executed as above set forth, and constituting one transaction, leads to the conclusion that oral testimony to incorporate as a part thereof the agreement to satisfy the Galveston judgment was erroneous and necessitates a reversal of the judgment. We are, however, of the opinion that the court did not err in refusing to strike out appellee’s plea in reconvention.</p>
