Jurisdiction of Suits to Enjoin a Trespass.—Appellee John Evans was the assignee of a vendor's lien note, dated November 23, 1886, and signed by Van Evans and wife. He obtained foreclosure judgment; the land was sold thereunder, and he became the purchaser and was placed in possession. Appellants Borchard, Ehrlick &amp; Co. were the holders of two deeds of trust made by Van Evans and wife, dated January 24 and February S, 1890, to secure a debt due B., E. &amp; Co., which was foreclosed in Galveston, with order that the purchaser be placed in possession. At sale made thereunder B., E. &amp; Co. became the purchasers. This suit was to enjoin the sheriff of Cherokee County, Reagan, from executing the writ of possession from Galveston County. Held, that the District Court of Cherokee County had jurisdiction.</p>

If the writ was void, the threatened <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>ejectment, if executed, would have been a trespass committed by the sheriff, and an injunction to restrain it is not an injunction restraining the execution of the judgment upon which the writ issued, and need not be returned to the court where judgment was obtained.</p>

D. 1891, in a suit wherein the said Borchard, Ehrlick <em>&amp; </em>Co. were plaintiffs and the said Van and Judith Evans were defendants, commanding said sheriff to sell said premises, and to place the purchasers in possession thereof; and that by virtue of said writ the said sheriff, as they were informed and believed, had sold said premises, and that at the sale the said Borchard, Ehrlick &amp; Co. became the purchasers. And petitioners further averred, that they were advised and believed that said writ was then functus officio; that it issued <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>on the 11th day of August, A.

Because said amended petition sets up a different cause of action than that set up in original petition, and the relief prayed for in the amended petition could not have been granted under the averments of the original petition. Second. Because the petition shows upon its face that at the time the appellee John Evans became the owner of the alleged vendor’s lien note, and at the time of the judgment of the District Court of Cherokee County foreclosing said lien, and under which said appellee claims title to the land in controversy, the appellants, the said Borchard, Ehrlick <em>&amp; </em>Co., were encumbrancers upon said land by virtue of two deeds of trust, men<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>tioned in said petition, and as such encumbrancers, had the equity of redemption of said land, and that they were not parties to said suit in which said vendor’s lien was foreclosed; and that said petition neither discloses nor alleges any fact or facts which would bind appellants by said judgment or the sale made thereunder.</p>
    <p id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[155,581,1302,683]]]'>As to the first of these two grounds of objection urged to the judgment of the court overruling appellants’ special exception to the amended petition, it is sufficient, we think, to say, that the court had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject matter of the suit, and the petition presented a good cause of action; and even if the cause of action set out in the amended petition was another and a different one to that presented in the original petition, if was competent for the court to permit the suit to proceed under such terms and conditions as in its judgment were proper; and if the appellants were surprised by the averments of the amended petition, or for any other sufficient cause they desired a postponement or continuance of the cause, they should have made application to the court for such postponement or continuance; and not having done so, they can not now be heard to complain of the judgment of the court in overruling their exception.</p>
    <p id="b67-6" data-blocks='[["BL_67.6",67,[155,1275,1299,434]]]'>The second ground of objection is based upon the assumption, that as the deeds of trust mentioned in plaintiffs’ petition showed that appellants Borchard, Ehrlick <em>&amp; </em>Co. were encumbrancers before the purchase of the vendor’s lien note, and before the institution of his suit by the said appellee John Evans for the foreclosure of said lien, the said appellants were necessary parties to said suit, in order to convey title to appellee John Evans under the decree of foreclosure. The vendor’s lien was expressly retained in the deed conveying the land from J. Addis to Edith Evans, under whom both appellants and appellee John Evans claim title.</p>

And as Addis, the assignor of the note, held the superior legal title to the land in trust for the benefit of his assignee, we think the rule announced in the cases cited, supra, is as applicable to this case as if the vendor, Addis, were the plaintiff, instead of his assignee, John Evans.</p>

Webb v. Maxan, 11 Texas, 340. And there is nothing in the record which shows, or would authorize us to conclude, that Evans, the plaintiff, knew of the mortgages executed by the vendee of the land to Borchard, Ehrlick <em>&amp; </em>Co. at the time he instituted his suit. The mortgagees were not in possession of the premises. The registration of the mortgages <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>was not notice to plaintiff. He was not asserting or claiming any rights under the mortgagor. The registration of the vendor’s deed was notice to the subsequent encumbrancers of the vendor’s lien, but the registration of the mortgages executed by the vendee was not notice of the mortgagee’s lien, to either the vendor or to the vendor’s assignee.</p>
    <p id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.5",68,[249,587,1299,336]]]'>Our conclusion is, therefore, that the mortgagees were not necessary parties to the suit for foreclosing the vendor’s lien, and that the judgment must be affirmed.
