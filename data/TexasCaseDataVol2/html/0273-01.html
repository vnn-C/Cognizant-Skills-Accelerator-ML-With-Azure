Case in Judgment—Evidence Showing Good Title.—Plaintiffs claimed as heirs of their father, Charles Gates, his undivided interest in lands granted to his father, William, and proved their heirship and coverture. Defendants deraigned their title under Amos Gates, a brother of Charles. They showed an article of agreement signed by Charles, and proven by a subscribing witness, by which he agreed to convey to Amos his interest in the estate of his father and the land in controversy, in consideration of $200 received. They also showed a decree of the alcalde of San Felipe de Austin, of February 17,1834, divesting the title of the other heirs of William Gates, and vesting it in Amos. They proved that Amos was in possession of the land several years before the death of his father; that Charles lived on the land until he left the county in 1832; that he died in 1840, and his widow and children returned in 1840 and lived on the land in a house belonging to Amos until 1850 or 1853. when they left; that Amos bought the interests of his other brothers and sisters, and claimed and exercised acts of ownership over the land until he sold, in 1857; and that Charles had been heard repeatedly to say that he had sold his interest in his father’s estate to Amos. Under these facts, and as during the lifetime of Charles a paroi sale of land was valid, the judgment in favor of defendants is affirmed.</p>

It was a recorded instrument, and even if the certificate of the officer before whom it purports to have been proved be not in accordance with the statute then in force, such certificates are now good by virtue of subsequent healing acts. The paper was properly admitted over this objection. The burthen was upon the plaintiffs to show the forgery, and they could not shift that burthen to defendants by a plea of non est factum, supported by affidavit.
