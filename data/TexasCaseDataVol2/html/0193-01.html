Certificate —Title by Estoppel.—H. purchased from certain heirs a land certificate which had issued to M., and a contract made by H. with A. for the location of certain certificates described in a schedule thereto attached, which schedule included the M, certificate, recited that the certificates so described were the property of A., and that H. was to locate them and receive therefor one-tliird of the land when he procured issuance of the patents. <em>Held, </em>that the recital that A. owned the certificates was binding on the heirs of £L, who were estopped thereby from claiming the contrary.</p>

Rice instituted this suit of trespass to try title, to recover from appellees herein as defendants a survey of 640 acres of land, lying in Cooke County, and patented to the heirs of Estevan Mora. The plaintiff Rice claimed the land by virtue of certain conveyances executed by persons claiming to be heirs of Estevan Mora. Pending the suit, the appellants herein, Belle Hunt Shortridge and others, who are heirs of W. H. Hunt, intervened. Their claim is founded upon the transfer to W. II. Hunt, their ancestor, of the certificate by virtue of which the land was located. This transfer was executed by Jose Mora, Mauricio Mora, and Eulogio Mora, representing themselves to be the sole heirs of Estevan Mora. Before the trial in the court below, the defendants S. B. Allen and others purchased the interest of the plaintiff Rice, and thereby became admittedly the owners of more than one-tliird of the land in controversy. The suit was thus limited to an issue for the remainder of the land between the intervenors, as heirs of W. II. Hunt, and the defendants, as heirs of C. C. Alexander. This issue resulted in a judgment for the defendants, from which the intervenors prosecute this appeal.</p>

The children of Hunt, knowing that their father had previous'to his death dealt largely in land, had exerted diligent inquiry with reference to his claims.

This conclusion was evidently founded upon the recital contained in the memorandum heretofore set out, and entered therein by Hunt himself, showing that A. M. and C. C. Alexander are the. ‘1 owners of the certificates described in the schedule hereunto attached. ’ ’ This recital must be deemed binding upon Hunt and upon his privies in blood, in estate, or in law, and to estop him and them from asserting the existence of a state of facts different from that which the recital imports.

H. Hunt has an undivided one-third” interest in the certificates constituting the list, in connection with the fact that the Mora claim had been , patented, indicates that there is probable error in the conclusion complained of. Such error, if it exist, will not require a reversal of the judgment.

The defendants pleaded against the recovery thus sought the statute of ten years limitation, and the defense of stale demand. If Hunt performed the locative services claimed by appellants, his cause of action matured with the procuring of the patent obtained in compliance with his locative contract. This patent having issued September 29, 1859, his cause of action then accrued, and the defense of stale demand began its course. Having thus commenced to run during the lifetime of W. H. Hunt, it is unaffected by the coverture or other disabilities of the intervenors; nor is its application changed by the fact, that by analogy to the statute of limitation it was suspended during the period intervening between the 28th day of January, 1861, and the 3d day of December, 1869.

For the reason that the right to specific performance and the cause of action thereon accrued during the lifetime of W. II.
