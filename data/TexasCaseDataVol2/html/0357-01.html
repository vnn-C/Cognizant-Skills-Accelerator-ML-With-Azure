The motion for a new trial filed by plaintiffs was overruled as to a portion of the defendants, who recovered a judgment against plaintiffs, and sustained as to the rest of such defendants. Our conclusion is, that this had the effect of granting a new trial as to all the defendants, and hence that the cause stands on the docket as if there had been no trial. Wootters v.
