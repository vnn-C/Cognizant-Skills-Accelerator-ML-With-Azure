May 26, 1890, Wright, one of the plaintiffs, verbally applied to Train Master Hume, at San Antonio, for twelve or thirteen cars, to be in readiness at Pearsall Station on the morning or the evening of May 28, 1890, to take out, on the morning of May 29, 1890, 298 head of beef cattle, belonging to plaintiffs, and destined for Chicago, Illinois, for sale on that market; and Hume promised to try to get the cars, and to wire the agent at Pearsall by the morning or afternoon of May 27, whether he could have them or not.</p>

Wright saw the agent at Pearsall and asked him if he had heard from Mr. Hume about any cars for him, and he answered, ‘ Yes,’ and that the cars would be at Pearsall to take out plaintiffs’ cattle on the next evening, May 28. He told the agent he wanted to know, as he did not wish to bring in the cattle unless they could be loaded out without delay the next morning, May 29. The agent stated to him that the cars would be at the station ready for him on the afternoon of the 28th, and that he could bring his cattle in and they would be loaded and shipped out early in the morning, about 9 or 10 o’clock, May 29. The cars arrived at Pearsall Station on the evening of May 28 to take out plaintiffs’ cattle the following morning, May 29, by 9 or 10 o’clock, and these cars were pointed out to Wright by the agent as the cars intended for the carriage of plaintiffs’ cattle.</p>

      <em>“5. </em>Early the next.morning the inspection began; but, after the inspection of about three or four car loads—about one-fourth of the cattle— one Jennings, another shipper, with about 300 cattle already inspected and ready for shipment, arrived at the station and demanded cars for their transportation.</p>
    <p id="b226-4" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[254,677,1302,488]]]'>“6. The agent, over the protest and objection of Wright, shipped Jennings’ cattle in the cars at the station which had been pointed out to him as the cars intended for plaintiffs’ cattle, and plaintiffs’ cattle were delayed' and held in the small pens contiguous to the large pen, into which they had been turned after the arrival of Jennings’ cattle, and while the same were being loaded into the cars, until about 6 o’clock in the evening of May 29. These pens were crowded and muddy, and the cattle were without food or water during the eight or nine hours delay occasioned by the refusal of the agent to permit the plaintiffs to have the cars which' were given to Jennings.</p>
    <p id="b226-5" data-blocks='[["BL_226.6",226,[256,1175,1299,131]]]'>11 7. After the arrival of Jennings’ cattle, the inspection of plaintiffs’' cattle was suspended until after Jennings’ cattle were loaded, which consumed about two and a half hours.</p>

It usually took from ten to fifteen minutes to inspect and load a carload of cattle. It was the custom at the stock pens at' Pearsall, and along the entire line of the International <em>&amp; </em>Great Northern Railway, to use the pens of the railway company for inspecting the cattle, and the practice was, when enough cattle had been inspected, to commence loading, and then to carry on the inspection and loading simultaneously.

There would have been no breach of the contract or delay, if the agent had not stopped the delivery of plaintiffs’ cattle to receive Jennings’. A part of plaintiffs’ cattle were ready to be loaded, and they could have been inspected as fast as they were loaded. The fact that Jennings presented cattle for shipment could not affect the right of plaintiffs under their contract.
