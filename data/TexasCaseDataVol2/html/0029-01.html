It is only through the operation of such appointment, if at all, that the receiver is placed in the attitude of a representative. How long his authority as such may continue is a question committed to the judgment of the court whose authority he represents; and the operation of its order determining his relation to the property is derived and must be ascertained from the law under which that court has proceeded.

This was done openly and without concealment, and he was sitting quietly in the car, when he was approached by the conductor and assaulted, without any demand having been made for his fare, or any opportunity having been afforded him after he entered the car to pay it. After the conductor had struck him several blows, he demanded the fare, and appellee either paid or was in the act of paying it, when the assault was continued, and he was beaten, cut with a knife, and thrown from the train while it was in full motion. This is the state of facts shown by the record, and the rules of law relied on by appellants, and expressed in the special charges, have no application. It is not the case of a passenger who refuses to pay his fare when demanded, until the conductor has commenced his expulsion from the car, and who is then put off lawfully and with the exertion of no unnecessary force. In that kind of case, the authorities referred to hold that the passenger can not, after the expulsion has commenced, tender his fare and require the carrier’s servants to accept it and permit-him to remain on the cars.

In all of these respects the case differs from those cited. Besides, the uncontradicted evidence shows, that the conductor began his expulson with an assault; followed that with a demand for his fare from appellee, and upon that being paid or offered, continued the use of violence, striking and cutting appellee, and finally threw him from the cars and left him dangerously wounded and senseless. In this he was exercising his functions as conductor, and acted as the servant of appellants; and whether the relation of carrier and passenger existed or not, the master would be liable.
