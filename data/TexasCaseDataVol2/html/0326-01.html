Lessor and Lessee—Liability of Lessee for Rent.—Appellee leased to appellant a lot on the gulf shore for $400 per annum, payable quarterly in advance. The defense was, that since the execution of the lease, and before the accrual of the rents sued for, the leased property had been submerged and encroached upon by the waters of the gulf, so that it was in great part below ordinary high tide, and because of the cutting away of the beach and the consequent depletion of the land it had ceased to be owned by plaintiff, was not subject to lease, nor under private dominion. Recovery by plaintiff was affirmed.</p>

Same—Destroyed Property.—In a proper case, rent for property totally destroyed should be abated, and when there is a partial destruction of the property, apportioned; but in this case the purpose of the lease was to prevent a rival street railway company from using it. The lessor knew when the lease was made that the lot was about two-thirds under water, and was a daily witness of the erosion of the beach and the encroachment of the water. It got all it contracted for, and the judgment of the lower court was right.</p>
