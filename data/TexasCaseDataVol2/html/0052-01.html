In 1885, under proposition for reorganization made by some of the directors and stockholders of an insolvent bank, it was proposed that if all stockholders would surrender their shares of stock, and the creditors would accept seventy-four per cent of their debts' in full payment, the proposers would provide <em>$1,000,000 for </em>the purpose of resuming business under a new organization. At a meeting of the stockholders of the insolvent bank, at which more than three-fourths were present, the proposition was accepted, and the directors were authorized to do all that was necessary to carry into effect the proposed arrangement, which they subsequently did by transferring to the new organization all of the property of the bank. One thousand shares of new stock were issued and taken, and these new stockholders assumed control of the bank. All the old stock, except thirty-two shares held by Corbin and Van Sickle, and now by appellant, were surrendered. Corbin and Van Sickle were not present at any of the meetings, and never in any way consented to or ratified the action of the other stockholders. They had paid in full for their stock, and advanced no additional sum, and took none of the new shares. Thereafter, by resolution, the directors undertook to make an assessment of $100 on each share of the old stock, and declared that unless payment thereof was made <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>in thirty days by the owner of the old stock, it should be forfeited. Notice of this resolution was given to Corbin and Van Sickle. <em>Held:</em>

After the failure of the bank a proposition was made to a meeting of its stockholders by S. Heidenheimer and others, which was, in substance, that if the owners of all of the stock of the bank would transfer and deliver to the signers of the communication all of the shares, and if the creditors of the bank would consent to accept 74 peícent of the amounts due them in full settlement, such signers would provide the sum of $100,000 for the purpose of carrying on the business of the bank, under a new organization and by the issuance of new stock, <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>under the charter of the bank, and would settle the debts on the proposed basis. It was also proposed, that ten days be allowed in which the stockholders and depositors might subscribe for the $100,000 of new stock, and that the proposers would take such balance as might be left untaken at the expiration of that time. By resolution this proposition was accepted by the unanimous vote of the meeting, at which more than three-fourths of the stockholders were present, and the directors were authorized to do all that was necessary to carry into effect the proposed arrangement. The resolution recited that the stockholders should surrender their certificates for such disposition as Heidenlieimer and his associates might see proper to make, and directed that such stockholders deliver their certificates transferred in blank to the Island City Savings Bank, that they might thereafter be disposed of to carry out the object in view.</p>

For it can hardly be contended that by such transfer and surrender Corbin and Van Sickle acquired any additional interest in the concern. It seems equally true that they are not entitled to be placed upon an equal footing with the holders of new stock; for these acquired all the rights of the other old stockholders "and contributed 8100,000 to the capital stock with which the business was resumed. Thus the new shares when issued represented both the rights of the old stockholders who transferred their shares, and those acquired through the new subscription. Counsel for appellant, in their brief, treat the issuance of the new certificates as being, in legal effect, an increase of the capital stock under the power given in the charter; and for the purpose of ascertaining the relative rights of appellant and other stockholders, this seems to us the true light in which to regard it. But if we should hold that appellant’s shares are equal to the others, this <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>would give to the transaction the effect of a reduction of stock; for there would then be only 1036 shares of $100 each, whereas there were formerly 1141 shares of the same denomination.</p>

This was not really done. By the consent of all persons concerned, but the three nonassenting members, the stock was fixed at $100,000, represented by 1000 shares. It is necessary to ascertain the proportionate interest which appellant’s stock continued to represent as against the holders of the new stock, and this is arrived at in the way indicated.</p>

Appellee contends that appellant’s assignors should be held to have acquiesced, by their delay to sue, in the action by the stockholders and directors. They did nothing affirmatively showing an intent to do so. The acceptance by Corbin of the money paid him as a creditor of the bank can not be held to have such effect. The nature of the demand made upon them was such as to call for positive action, rather than mere silence, to signify assent to the transaction. Their failure to transfer and surrender their stock prevents any inference of acquiescence from their silence. As to their failure to sue, the statute of limitations prescribes the time which would constitute a bar. The well settled principles of equity, by which a party may be precluded by loches from attacking unauthorized acts of a corporation of which he is a member, do not apply to the facts of this case. Because of such delay, however, if for no other reason, we think the aid of equity to reinstate him in the enjoyment of the • privileges of a stockholder should be withheld. The managers of the bank have been allowed to go on and establish its organization in accord.anee with the arrangements made in 1885; the business of the bank is doubtless readjusted to the conditions arising out of them. The consequences of forcing appellant into the corporation as a shareholder upon the basis of his right, as we find it to be, may not be easily foreseen. He can be compensated in money for any damages which he has sustained, and we think, under the circumstances, that should be his remedy. The measure of damages should be the value of the stock, treating it as 32 <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>shares in 2141, at the time of its conversion, with legal interest thereon to the date of trial.</p>

The value at that time should be ascertained and form the basis of recovery at another trial. Cook on Stock and Stockh., sec. 581, and notes.</p>
    <p id="b85-5" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[154,727,1303,186]]]'>Plaintiff’s exceptions to the plea of intervention should have been sustained, in the absence of allegations showing that the defense would not be properly conducted by the defendant. The stockholders are not ordinarily proper parties in such a case.</p>
    <p id="b85-6" data-blocks='[["BL_85.6",85,[152,926,1304,486]]]'>From what we have said, it follows that the court should have sustained plaintiff’s exceptions to the third and fourth subdivisions of defendant’s answer, in which the resolutions of the board of directors attempting to assess and cancel the stock were relied on as a bar to the action. The defendant, however, adopted the plea of interveners, and the proceedings of the stockholders’ meeting therein set up, showing the proposition of Heidenheimer and others, and its acceptance, while constituting no bar to the suit, are proper to be considered in determining the rights thereby acquired, as we have defined them, as are all other facts affecting that question.</p>
    <p id="b85-7" data-blocks='[["BL_85.7",85,[151,1424,1302,236]]]'>Upon the written transfers of the stock appellant was entitled to maintain the action. He acquired only such rights as his assignors had, and he can not be considered an innocent purchaser. Evidence therefore as to the agreement with his assignors, under which he acquired the certificates, under present issues, would be immaterial.</p>

That seems to be the only issue that needs to be submitted to the jury.</p>
