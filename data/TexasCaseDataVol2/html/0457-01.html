It does not convey title had it been in May’s principals, but it is on its face a deed, containing all the elements of a valid deed tested by itself,, <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>and we think may be the basis of- limitation by the ten years statute. The deed was duly acknowledged and duly recorded. Assuming that there was no power in the agent to make the conveyance, his act was a deed.</p>

McKinna, 23 Texas, 44, where it was held that a void tax deed could be used as predicate of limitation, the question of necessity of a power was discussed; it is said: &lt;{ It does not follow that it [a deed] is not a deed because the power of the agent is not produced.”</p>
