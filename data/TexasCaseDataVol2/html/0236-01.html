That appellant was engaged to furnish said labor and material by said Smye and Peters, president and secretary of the two corporations, while they were in possession of and managing the property. That part of the same was furnished after November 3, 1887, though what proportion is not shown.

Patterson admitted in his answer that his partner, Scudder, had acquired all the rights of Patterson &amp; Scudder under the deed of trust to the property in question.</p>

    <p id="b267-6" data-blocks='[["BL_267.6",267,[170,830,1301,724]]]'>2. Appellant alleged in his petition that the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was the owner of the land at the time the contract for labor and material was made, and said company, as defendant, filed no answer, but made default. Under these circumstances, as against this company, appellant was not required to prove its ownership of the land at the time the contract in question was made; and as the record does not show that the trust deed to secure the mone3’" borrowed by said company from Patterson &amp; Scudder has ever been foreclosed, he was, at least, entitled to a judgment establishing and foreclosing his lien against the property in question, subject to the Patterson &amp; Scudder debt. In other words, as the evidence does not show that the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company’s equity of redemption has been sold and bought in by Scudder, as alleged in his answer, and as the company made default, appellant was entitled to a judgment subjecting the company’s right of redemption to the satisfaction of his debt.</p>
    <p id="b267-7" data-blocks='[["BL_267.7",267,[168,1576,1300,532]]]'>3. Appellant contends, however, that he is entitled to a judgment establishing his lien against the property and according it priority over the mortgage lien of Patterson <em>&amp; </em>Scudder, or any right or title dependent upon their mortgage. On the other hand, Scudder resists this contention, and claims, that as the mortgagor, the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, had no title to the land upon which the house was built at the time it contracted with appellant to furnish labor and material for its construction, appellant could not, and did not, acquire a lien on the property, although said company acquired title thereto prior to the execution of the mortgage under which appellee claims', and pending performance by appellant of his part of the contract.</p>

In that State it is provided, that 11 such lien shall not attach unless the contract is made in writing and signed by the owner of the land, or some person duly authorized by him, and recorded in the registry of deeds for the county where the land lies.” The same statute declares, that “if the person who procures the work to be done has an estate for life only, or any other estate less than a fee simple, in the land on which the work is to be done, he shall nevertheless be considered as the owner for the purposes of this chapter, to the extent of his right and interest in the land, <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>and the lien before provided for shall bind his whole estate and interest therein.”</p>

    <p id="b269-8" data-blocks='[["BL_269.8",269,[210,949,1301,882]]]'>Other authorities, however, not cited by Mr. Jones, support a much more liberal construction of lien statutes. In the case of Coleman v. Goodnow et al., 36 Minnesota, 9, it was shown, that the plaintiff furnished the last of the material for the erection of a building, about the 16th day of December, 1880; the building was commenced in October, 1880, the defendants being in possession of the premises at the time; it was not shown that they had any contract to purchase, and when the contract was made the defendants had not acquired title to the land, but the same was owned by one Pease, who conveyed the same to the defendant Goodnow, November 23, 1880. In that case the mechanic’s lien was upheld; the court holding that the acquisition of title by Goodnow united in him the ownership of the house and lot, and that the lien rested upon his interest in both, and that he would not be permitted to defeat it by setting up title in a third person previous to that date. It is true, that the opinion does not disclose the terms of the statute then in foi;ce in that State, nor have we had access thereto. We infer, however, from the tenor of the opinion, that the statute in question required a contract with the owner. See also Hooker v. McGlone, <a href="/conn/42/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="42 Conn. 95" data-case-ids="747185" data-case-paths="/conn/42/0095-01">42 Conn., 95</a>.</p>

    <p id="b270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_270.6",270,[232,776,1300,486]]]'>The rule of construction, applicable in many States of the Union, that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly' construed, probably had considerable influence in producing the line of decisions that place rigid interpretations upon statutes creating and securing mechanics’ and material men’s liens. Indeed, Mr. Jones, in section 1554 of his treatise on Liens, says: “ Mechanics’ liens are in derogation of the common law, depending for their existence wholly upon statutes; and therefore, upon the question whether a lien attaches at all, a strict construction is proper.” As before said, and for reasons given, this rule of construction has no application in this State.</p>
    <p id="b270-8" data-blocks='[["BL_270.7",270,[232,1274,1298,536]]]'>4. Appellee Scudder, however, claims protection as a bona fide mortgagee and purchaser for value and without notice. This claim is founded upon these facts: November 15, 1887, Patterson &amp; Scudder made a loan of $15,000 to the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, to secure which a trust deed was executed by said company on the property in question; at the time of making this loan, they caused the records of Bexar County to be examined, and found no evidence of appellant’s lien or claim on record, and Patterson admitted in his answer that the averments in Scudder’s answer, to the effect that the property had been sold under the deed of trust and purchased by him, Scudder, were true. As against appellant, the record contains no proof of such sale.</p>
    <p id="b270-9" data-blocks='[["BL_270.8",270,[229,1823,1299,630]]]'>It was not charged in the answer, and there was no evidence tending to show, that the money was loaned or mortgage taken because of any concealment, misrepresentation, or other fraudulent conduct on the part of appellant. Appellant’s claim against the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was founded upon a verbal contract, by the terms of which he was to furnish all the sheet iron, tin, galvanized iron, and other like material, as well as the necessary labor, to cover the sides and roof of a factory; and under article 3166, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, he was allowed four months after his demand became due to secure his lien by filing for record his verified account. His debt was not due until the company notified him of its insolvency and inability to complete the building, and directed him to quit work thereon; and he at once filed his account in compliance with the statute referred to.</p>

    <p id="b271-6" data-blocks='[["BL_271.6",271,[208,737,1299,485]]]'>It was held in Trammell v. Mount, 68 Texas, 215: “The lien of a mechanic, though not fixed before record of the contract or bill of particulars, when it is fixed, relates back to the time when the work was performed or material furnished, and hence takes precedence of all claims to the property improved which have been fastened upon it since that time.” In Keating Implement and Machine Company v. Marshall Light Company, supra, this doctrine was reaffirmed, and the broad proposition asserted, that within the period of time allowed by the statute for the lien to be fixed by being recorded, every person dealing with the property is charged with notice of the existence of the lien.</p>
