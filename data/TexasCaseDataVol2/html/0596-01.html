Charge of Court—Evidence Held to Raise Issue.—Where plaintiff gave in evidence a transfer purporting to have been executed and signed by W.. and defendant offered testimony to the effect that W. could neither read nor write, an issue was thereby raised as to whether the instrument was executed <em>by authority </em>of W., and this question was therefore properly submitted by the court to the jury.</p>

The land was located many years ago by virtue of an unlocated balance of the head-right certificate issued to Gadi West, but no patent ever issued. Appellee deraigned title by mesne conveyance from West. The matter in controversy was the genuineness of the conveyance from West to one William C. Boone, which bears date July 5,1838, and was acknowledged July 25, 1852. This issue was submitted to the jury, and our conclusion is, that their finding in favor of its genuineness is supported by the evidence. It is undisputed that appellee had whatever title Boone acquired by that conveyance.</p>

There was testimony offered by appellants to the effect that West could neither read nor write. The issue was therefore raised, whether <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>his name had been signed to the conveyance with or without his consent. It seems clear to us that this assignment is not well taken.</p>
    <p id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[277,439,1299,335]]]'>The second assignment complains that there was error in allowing this conveyance to be read to the jury over the several objections made thereto by the defendants, as shown by their bill of exceptions number 1. No propositions or statements are submitted under this assignment, nor are we in any way informed by the briefs what these objections were. It appears therefrom that there were several of them. This assignment is therefore manifestly bad.</p>
    <p id="b624-6" data-blocks='[["BL_624.6",624,[274,787,1301,238]]]'>The fourth assignment complains of the refusal of the court to give special instructions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Appellee objects to our considering the propositions submitted under this assignment, because it is not sufficiently specific. Under the well settled rules of practice, therefore, we are precluded from considering these propositions.</p>
