Appellants claimed, also, that the land was their homestead at the time of the recording of the abstract, the levy of the execution, and the sale thereunder. Appellee, at the time his abstract was filed, and when the execution was levied, had no notice of the deed from Russell to his wife, but received notice before the sale. He also attacked the deed from Russell to his wife, on the ground that it was made with the intent to hinder, delay, and defraud Russell’s creditors.</p>
    <p id="b88-8" data-blocks='[["BL_88.9",88,[240,1230,1303,1180]]]'>The facts in regard to the claim of homestead, as found by the district judge, and shown by the evidence, are as follows: Russell and his first wife, up to 1873, occupied the land as their homestead. They were then divorced, and Russell continued to live on the place until he married his present wife, in December, 1883. She refused to' live there, and neither of them have since done so, though they have gotten some firewood, vegetables, fruits, and the like, from their tenants on the place, which they used for family purposes. The land lies three miles from Beaumont. In 1890 Russell bought lots 15 and 16, in block 4 of the Calder addition to Beaumont, after the same had been cut up into blocks, lots, streets, etc., and a map thereof placed of record. His lots front on Calder Avenue, and he immediately built and occupied, with his wife, his residence on these two lots, and was so living upon and occupying them at the time of this trial in the District Court. He paid for the lots, but there is a lien upon them for balance due for improvements. There were houses north, east, south, and west of him, and lots in the Calder addition were then worth from $250 to $600, the defendant paying $625 for his. A part of this Calder addition runs up to the Crosby Hotel, the chief hotel in the city, though the addition itself lies just outside the corporate limits. The town was incorporated in 1881. The superintendent of the city public schools lives across the street from defendants. Russell is a practicing lawyer and keeps an office in Beaumont. The court found, as a fact, that the Calder addition was a part of the town of Beaumont, and that appellants’ homestead was in the town.</p>

There was no objection to the evidence when offered in the court below, no motion for new trial, nor exceptions to the findings of the judge, nor was the point in any way called to the attention of the trial court. It is too late to present it for the first time in this court, and it can not be considered.</p>

The sheriff had made the deed to plaintiff, and whether or not he had paid the costs was an inquiry which could not affect the issues involved in this suit. It was shown at the trial that he did pay the costs and had the balance of his bid credited on the execution.</p>

It follows, that under the evidence in the case, unless appellants sustained their claim that the land was their homestead, no judgment was proper but that which was rendered. As to such claim, the evidence amply sustains the finding of the court below, that they had abandoned the rural homestead and acquired another in a town or city. They could not hold both, and the land in controversy was therefore subject.</p>

    <p id="b90-6" data-blocks='[["BL_90.8",90,[266,839,1305,738]]]'>The evidence shows clearly, that the judgment in favor of the appellee against appellant Thomas J. Russell was duly recorded in the office of the county clerk of Jefferson County before the deed from the latter to his wife was registered, and there is no evidence that appellee had notice of such deed, or of any claim to the land by Mrs. Russell, before his judgment was recorded. Under such circumstances the title of the purchaser at the execution sale, although he then had notice that Mrs. Russell was the owner of the land, must be held paramount to hers, .notwithstanding the fact that the premises may have been conveyed to her for a valuable consideration, prior to the recording of the judgment against her husband in favor of appellee. This is so by the operation of the statute, which declares all unregistered deeds of conveyance void as to subsequent purchasers and creditors. Wallace v. Campbell, 54 Texas, 90; Grimes v. Hobson, 46 Texas, 418; Borden v. McRae, 46 Texas, 396; Grace v. Wade, 45 Texas, 528; Ayres v. Duprey, 27 Texas, 593.</p>

Kornrumpf, 64 Texas, 390, to which appellants refer us in support of their motion, is not in conflict with the cases cited above. Ross v. Kornrumpf, like McKamey v. Thorp, 61 Texas, 648; Parker v. Coop, 60 Texas, 111; Senter <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Lambeth, 59 Texas, 260, and Blankenship v. Douglas, 26 Texas, 229, holds, that the statutes of registration do not apply to equitable titles such as are derived from resulting trusts, as where land is purchased with the separate funds of the wife and the deed of conveyance is made to the husband, or when the deed, though made to the wife, does not by its terms show that it is made to her in her separate right. When such is the case, the creditor, by recording his judgment against the husband, acquires a lien against the ap<a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>parent title of the husband; but such lien may be avoided by the wife upon giving notice of her title to the creditor before sale of the land.</p>
    <p id="b91-5" data-blocks='[["BL_91.5",91,[154,423,1307,235]]]'>But in this case, the property in controversy was owned by Thomas J. Russell before his marriage with the appellant Louise H. Russell, and the latter acquired the legal title to the property by direct conveyance from her husband; and her deed therefore must be considered as within the •operation of the statutes of registration.</p>
    <p id="b91-6" data-blocks='[["BL_91.6",91,[156,670,1306,378]]]'>Where the title is one which rests in equity, as we have seen, it is excepted from the operation of the registration laws, for the very obvious reason that such title, from its very nature, can not be registered. But where a married woman acquires the legal title to the land, although the title be through conveyance from her husband, she must register her deed, otherwise it, like any unregistered deed from her husband to a stranger, will be void as to subsequent purchasers or creditors without notice.</p>
    <p id="b91-7" data-blocks='[["BL_91.7",91,[154,1069,1308,1131]]]'>The appellant Thomas J. Russell has thought proper to assail the honorable court that tried this cause, and to charge that its judgment was inspired by the malice of the judge. The judge of every court, until otherwise determined in the mode prescribed by the law of the land, must be presumed to be incapable of intentional wrong or injustice; and he must be treated with courtesy and deference by litigants and their counsel. This is essential for the peaceable and orderly administration of justice. We must therefore condemn the conduct of the appellant for the language applied in his brief to the judge of the lower court, and place upon it the seal of reprobation. For similar language applied by counsel in his brief to a judge of the District Court, as shown in the case of Smith v. The State, 5 Texas, 578, proceedings for contempt were instituted both in the District and Supreme Court; and in the District Court the offending counsel was fined and his license revoked. For the present, however, we refrain from ordering an attachment for the appellant. But in justice to him who tried the case in the court below, we are constrained to say, that not one of his conclusions of fact is without some evidence at least to support it; and while it is true that under the pleadings there was no issue of fraud in the case, yet evidence of fraud was admitted, without objection by the appellants, which fully sustained the conclusion of the court, that the deed from appellant Thomas J. Russell to his wife was made with the intent to hinder and.delay his creditors. The motion is overruled and a new hearing refused.</p>
