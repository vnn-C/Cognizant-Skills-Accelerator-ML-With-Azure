And the decree, after adjudging that the parties to whom the lands were adjudged should pay the judgments in favor of League and Lapsley, each in proportion to his share in said lands, further directed, that if these judgments were not paid within six months, execution might issue and be levied upon so much of the eleven leagues as should be necessary to satisfy the judgments.</p>
