Appellant Martin held a junior lien, dated June 25, 1885. In December, 1885, the debtor, Johnston, executed to the bank one note for his total indebtedness to it, due at ninety days., which included a discount of eighteen per cent, and at the end of every ninety days a new note was executed and discounted at the same rate, the lien notes being held by it as collateral security. Desiring further extension, on January 1,1887, Johnston executed a new note to plaintiff, bearing 12 per cent interest, payable eighteen months after date, and reciting that the other notes were held by and hypothecated to plaintiff as collateral security for its payment. Plaintiff paid Johnston’s indebtedness to the bank, and the lien notes were by the bank transferred to plaintiff. By agreement annexed, Johnston recognized the validity of the lien notes, and waived the statute of limitation. Mrs. Martin pleaded as a defense against the elder lien notes, usury. As a junior encumbrancer she could avail herself of whatever defense Johnston had, although he was a party to the suit and suffered judgment by default.</p>

Limitation Waived, Effect of.—The agreement of December 30,1886, made by Johnston with plaintiff, acknowledged the validity of the three lien notes, and promised to pay them, waiving the statute of limitations; and though it was-a promise made by him subsequent to the execution of the junior encumbrance, the weight of authority is, that he had the right to waive limitation, though it would deprive the junior encumbrancer of the defense of limitation.</p>

Amount Forfeited for Usury.—Two of the elder lien notes were not tainted with usury when made; it was only after they were transferred to the bank that the question of usury arises. As to the amounts represented by these notes, the entire interest should not be forfeited, but only the excess of interest over the amount of interest called for by their face.</p>

Same.—The $3500 note was discounted to the bank for $2865, being at the rate of 18 per cent per annum, and the contract was usurious, and all payments of interest on this note, whether by way of discount or otherwise, should be applied to the principal thereof, including the first discount; and as a new note was executed every ninety days for the aggregate indebtedness and discounted afresh,.there should be quarterly rests in the computation of the interest to ascertain the amounts to be credited.</p>

Renta Under Lien, How Applied.—The rents of Johnston’s building were also mortgaged to secure the senior debts; but he remained in possession of the property, and applied the rents to the payment of his unsecured indebtedness. This he might do, as he was in possession and had the right of disposition thereof until possession was taken under the deed of trust; but after a receiver was appointed the rents should have been applied to the extinguishment of the lien on the property and rents.</p>

    <p id="b525-3" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[181,801,1297,428]]]'>It was shown by the evidence, that the balance of indebtedness taken up by the plaintiff, and for which Johnston executed his note for $5500, was ascertained after the application of the rents of the building, which were collected by the bank, to the payment of usurious interest. Mrs. Martin p'eaded usury, and contends that all interest should be forfeited, and the rents should be applied to the principal of the lien notes; first, to the note for the amount of indebtedness represented by the $3500 note and deed of trust, which was also a lien on the rents, and then to the other notes.</p>
    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[179,1249,1298,377]]]'>There are many authorities which hold that usury is a defense so strictly personal that a third party can not avail himself thereof; but it seems that 11 the doctrine more generally adopted is, that not only the mortgagor, but any person who is seized of his estate and vested with his rights, unless he has assumed the payment of the mortgage, may interpose this defense, although a mere stranger can not.” 1 Jones on Mort., sec. 644. A junior mortgagee may set up usury in the mortgage. <a href="/minn/5/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="5 Minn. 508" data-case-ids="8877026" data-case-paths="/minn/5/0508-01">Id.,</a> and authorities cited in note 9.</p>
    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.6",525,[178,1647,1298,435]]]'>When a purchaser of the equity of redemption assumes the payment of the mortgage, it becomes a part of the consideration paid for the land, and it is immaterial with such purchaser whether there is usury in the mortgage or not. The language used in the Martin deed of trust, that it is taken subject to the liens in favor of the Brooke Smith and Cameron &amp; Co. notes, is nothing more than a mere acknowledgment of notice of these liens, and does not affect the holder of the Martin encumbrance with any obligation not to set up any lawful defense which Johnston himself may have then had or subsequently acquired to the notes.</p>
    <p id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.7",525,[179,2093,1299,437]],["BL_526.1",526,[280,349,1301,828]]]'>We do not think, however, that the Coggin <em>&amp; </em>Parks vendor’s lien note nor the William Cameron &amp; Co. note were tainted with usury. It was only subsequently to their execution, and after they had been transferred to the bank, that the question of usury arises, and then usurious interest was paid and taken upon sums represented by them as the amounts paid for them. With reference to the amounts represented by these notes, we do not think the entire amount of interest should be forfeited; only the excess of interest over the amount called for in their face should be credited on the principal. The note for $3500 was executed to indemnify <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>the said Brooke Smith as an endorser of a note executed by the said Johnston to the bank for §3000. As the creditor of Johnston, with Smith as security, the bank was entitled to whatever security Smith had, and when Smith endorsed the note for $3500 to the bank, it became in the hands of the bank merely collateral security for the note of Johnston to the bank for $3000. The latter note was discounted to the bank for $2865, being at the rate of 18 per cent per annum, a rate which was usurious, so the contract was a usurious contract. All payments of interest on this note, whether by way of discount or otherwise, should be applied to the principal thereof, including the first discount. In the judgment below the court seems to have only allowed the excess of interest as a credit on the principal, which was error. As a new note was executed every ninety •days for the aggregate indebtedness, and discounted afresh, it follows that there should be quarterly rests in the computation of the interest, so as to ascertain the amounts to be credited, and we are not in the possession of sufficient data to enable us to arrive at the amount. It may be that the books of the bank will show the actual amounts received as interest.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[282,1196,1296,739]]]'>Johnston remained in the possession of the property, and in addition to the payment of interest applied the rents to the extinction of his unsecured indebtedness. Appellant contends, that as the deed of trust for the $3500 note was also a lien on the rents, they should have been applied entirely to the extinction of the lien. This seems to be otherwise. 1 Jones on Mort., sec. 670. Johnston remained in possession of the rents as of the other property included in the deed of trust, and had the right of disposition thereof until possession was taken under the deed of trust. But when the receiver was appointed and the property taken charge of by the court, the rents should then have been applied at least to the ex-tinguishment of the lien on the property and rents to secure the note for $3500; hence the court erred in adjudging that the rents accumulated and to accumulate in the hands of the receiver after his appointment should be applied to the payment of that portion of the plaintiff’s judgment which had been postponed to the appellants’ lien.</p>
