It is also set up, “that for thirty years, and while the land over which the road runs was public domain, the public acquired and has since maintained over said roadbed through said tract of land a constant right of way, adequate in width, to-wit, 60 feet wide, to meet the public demands, and that the said roadway the whole of said time has been continuously and peaceably kept public for all purposes of a free and unobstructed passage, and that no part of said roadbed has ever been discontinued, nor has the easement in said passage' ever been in anywise diminished; that on and for more than three years prior to the 17th of February, 1887, Llano County has held in trust for the said travelling public 30 feet width of said roadbed, and styled said portion of said roadbed a second class road, and works the same as such; that in 1882, plaintiff’s vendor, Cr.

The jury are required (article 4370) to issue notice in writing to the land owners through whose lands a proposed road may run, or to agents, of the time when they will lay out the same, or when they will assess the damages incidental to the opening of the same, which notice shall be served upon the owner or agent at least five days before the day named. This notice is the initial step, the original writ, that invokes the jurisdiction of the jury and the Commissioners Court, and requires the land owner to appear and make claim for damages. If he does not appear after such notice and state his damages, he waives them, according to article 4372; but if he makes his claim, it is made the duty of the' jury to assess the damages and report the same with their report of survey to the Commissioners Court, which then estimates the damages—an adequate compensation for the land taken. We do not wish to be understood as holding that there could be a waiver under article 4372, under a regular proceeding. It is not necessary to decide the point in this case.</p>

The statute does not require the jury to assess the damages at the same time they lay off the road; the notice may fix another time for this purpose. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 4370. But no notice of any kind was served upon plaintiff. In such case there could be no waiver. His presence as one of the jury could not bind him. The proceeding to assess the damages had not been instituted, and he was not bound to make the claim at the time. He protested against their running the road through the land, and made a minority report as one of the jury. After the court adopted the majority report and appropriated his land, he asked the court to appoint a jury to assess his damages. This was the mode of having the damage» assessed under the Revised Statutes (article 4371), referred to in article 4360a of the amended law, but article 4371 of the old law was amended only two days before article 4360a was added to the old law. It is not necessary that we should determine what act was referred to in article 4360a. Let it be admitted that it referred to article 4371 as amended two days before, it is still true that plaintiff had not been notified to appear before the forum authorized to assess his damages, and had waived no right to the same.</p>
