Ambiguities—Defective Description.—The rule is well settled that less indulgence will be shown in favor of descriptions in deeds based on compulsory sales, than applies to descriptions in deeds voluntarily executed by the owner. In compulsory sales under judicial process, if there is a patent ambiguity in the description of the land sold, it can not be aided by paroi evidence, and the deed is void.</p>

Defective Description.—In a sheriff's deed was the following description: “All the right, title, and claims of the said Mariana Rodriguez, in and to the aforesaid interest in the old Hernandez tract, the said interest being one-half of that part and portion of the said tract which was transferred to the Manehacas.

    <p id="b235-6" data-blocks='[["BL_235.6",235,[164,529,1298,338]]]'>The deed executed by J. C. Morgan, as deputy sheriff of Bexar County, to Thomas M. Dennis, dated October 2, 1839, constitutes a link in the chain of title upon which the plaintiffs and the intervenors rest their claims to the land involved. The introduction of this deed in evidence was objected to by appellant Victor Beze, because of its failure to describe the land in controversy. Error is assigned upon the action of the court in overruling this objection.</p>
    <p id="b235-7" data-blocks='[["BL_235.7",235,[164,880,1298,437]]]'>The deed describes the land which it purports to convey as follows: 6 £All the right, title, and claims of the said Mariano Rodiguez in and to the aforesaid interest in the old Hernandez tract, the said interest being one-half of that part and portion of the said tract which was transferred to the Manchacas; the said part and portion being on the east bank of the San Antonio River, below and adjoining the lands of the Arochas, commencing at Pajaritos Creek and running down, and known as the Manchaca tract, the interest and half of the same above sold and herein conveyed being the upper half.”</p>

C. Morgan, deputy sheriff as aforesaid, levied upon divers real properties (therebeing no goods or chattels found), to-wit: *' * * and an interest in a tract of land known as the old Hernandez tract on the San Antonio River,” and, “I, the aforesaid deputy sheriff and party of the first part in this indenture, did on the specified day offer the same, to-wit, the aforesaid interest in the Hernandez tract, for sale.”</p>
    <p id="b235-10" data-blocks='[["BL_235.9",235,[166,1776,1296,426]]]'>The rule is well settled, that less indulgence will be shown in favor of descriptions of property contained in deeds based on compulsory sales under judicial process than applies to descriptions given in deeds and other instruments voluntarily executed by the owner of the property. And in the former class of cases, if there is a patent ambiguity in the description of the land, it can not be aided by paroi evidence, and the deed is void. Wofford v. McKinna, 23 Texas, 36; Norris v. Hunt, 51 Texas, 615; Mitchell v. Ireland, 54 Texas, 301; Wooters v. Arledge, 54 Texas, 395.</p>

For instance, it does not name the county, state, or other political division wherein the land is situated; it does not give the name of the original survey of which the land con<a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>veyed is a part, but merely calls it “ the old Hernandez tract;” it describes the land conveyed as “ one half ” of the portion of said Hernandez tract transferred to the Manchacas, without disclosing whether the “ one half” so conveyed isa segregated moiety of, cran undivided interest in, the whole of the Manchaca tract; it calls it one half the portion which was transferred to the Manchacas, but fails to show when or by whom it was transferred, and to how many and which of the Manchacas the transfer was made, and the quantity of land so transferred to them; and gives no other means of identifying the Manchaca land than the statement that it is on the east bank of the San Antonio River, below and adjoining the lands of the Arochas, commencing at Pajaritos Creek and running down, and known as the Manchaca tract. And the final clause, “ the interest and half of the same above sold and herein conveyed, being the upper half,” is equally as uncertain. If “ the interest” constitutes the upper half, it is difficult to perceive how ‘' half of the same ’ ’ can also be the upper half. And the word “upper” may mean up the river, up the creek, or the natural ascent of the land.</p>
