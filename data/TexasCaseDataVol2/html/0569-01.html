Injury to Brakeman — Case in Judgment.—Plaintiff, a bralceman of eight or ten years service, attempted tó go to the top of a box car upon which he was braking; the hand-hold on top of the car pulled out, and he was thrown to the ground and seriously injured. The cause of the hand-hold pulling out was because the top of the car to which it had been screwed was rotten. The condition of the hold was not known to the plaintiff, was not patent, and could not have been known by the exercise of ordinary diligence, and no rule of the company required him to inspect the hand-hold before using it. He had noticed a good many roofs rotten on the road, and had worked on cars with rotten roofs, but never noticed any hand-holds loose. A verdict for §3000 was affirmed.</p>

Culver against the defendants, as receivers of the St. Louis, Arkansas &amp; Texas Railway in Texas, to recover damages for personal injuries received by the plaintiff while in the employ of defendants and in the discharge of his duties as brakeman, and alleged to have been caused by a defective hand-hold upon a car which the plaintiff was mounting, by reason of the rotten condition of the wooden roof to which the hand-hold was attached by screws.</p>
    <p id="b596-6" data-blocks='[["BL_596.10",596,[268,1141,1300,89]]]'>Trial was had by jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff upon a verdict in his favor for §5000.</p>
    <p id="b596-7" data-blocks='[["BL_596.11",596,[268,1242,1300,429]]]'>Briefly stated, the facts are, that on the 28th day of May, 1890, the plaintiff was in the employment of the defendants in the capacity of brakeman. He was an experienced railroad man of eight or nine years service, and was familiar with the duties of brakeman. On that day, while attempting to go on top of a box car in the train upon which he was braking, the hand-hold on top of the car pulled out and plaintiff was thrown to the ground and seriously injured. The cause of the hand-hold pulling out was because the top of the car to which it had been screwed was rotten.</p>
    <p id="b596-8" data-blocks='[["BL_596.12",596,[265,1690,1302,487]]]'>The condition of the hand-hold was not known to the plaintiff when he attempted to go on top of the car, and it was not open and patent to him, and under the circumstances he could not have known of it by the exercise of ordinary diligence. There was no rule of the defendants which required him to inspect the hand-hold or car before using the handhold. It was not customary to inspect the cars above the running gear at inspecting points, where the wheels and other running gear were inspected, but only when the cars were put on the repair tracks. Plaintiff was not a car inspector, but the brakemen were expected to report anything that they saw that was unsafe.</p>
    <p id="b596-9" data-blocks='[["BL_596.13",596,[266,2188,1299,229]]]'>Plaintiff testified that he had noticed a good many roofs being rotten at times, and had seen some of the cars belonging to the system of which the railway in charge of defendants was a part with rotten roofs, and had worked on cars with rotten roofs, but had never noticed any hand-holds loose.</p>
    <p id="b596-10" data-blocks='[["BL_596.14",596,[275,2436,1290,88]],["BL_597.1",597,[133,339,1307,1283]]]'>Plaintiff was hurt May 28, 1890, and the trial was had in February, 1891. Before the injury he had been a stout, healthy young man; but <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>afterwards, up to the time of the trial, had been unable to do any work. He fell about sixteen feet, and in falling his right side struck on a flat car ■standing on a side track, and he then fell into a ditch alongside of the train, where he lay insensible, with blood running from his nose and mouth, until he was taken up and carried to the hospital. He had hemorrhages from the lungs on account of the injuries, shortly after-wards. He remained in the hospital about a month. He used crutches for awhile, but had discarded them. Dr. Baldwin examined him three or four months after the injury, and found him in a wretched state of health. He was considerably emaciated, had jaundice, and considerable trouble with his lungs. The doctor found his right lung in a congested state, and found scars located on the right side above the fifth or sixth rib, and right over the lung; the liver is just below this region. The lung was hepatized and consolidated, with very little air passing into it. It was caused by stasis, or stagnation of blood in the lungs. The other lung was clear and all right. It was the opinion of the physician that plaintiff’s condition was caused from a blow or injury; that-a blow was calculated to affect the lung by congestion. On further examination just before the trial, Dr. Baldwin found the condition of the lung still to be hepatized and consolidated in the lower part. Pleurisy, or inflammation of the pleura, was indicated. It was his opinion, that the lung was permanently injured, and on account thereof plaintiff was more liable to cold than if the lung was in its normal condition. It might take pneumonia. Plaintiff could not do the heavy work that he had done, and the lung would be always one great point in breaking down his health. Jaundice was merely a symptom of disease.</p>
    <p id="b597-5" data-blocks='[["BL_597.5",597,[136,1636,1299,235]]]'>There was much other evidence. The effect of all is, however, that the plaintiff was very severely injured, and received internal injuries which resulted in permanently impairing the lower lobe of his right lung, and weakening him so that he would never be capable of doing heavy work again.</p>
