Said instrument was endorsed, <em>“ </em>Filed 4th October, 1836. E. H. Winfield, clerk D. C. B.” It was also filed for record in the record of deeds for Brazoria County, August 30, 1887, and then recorded; and again, on proof made by the affidavit of H.

All the evidence as to the custody is, that by some means the deed was deposited by some one with the clerk of Brazoria County, probably at the date of the file mark thereon, and was found in the clerk’s office in an old package of deeds, in 1886 or in 1887.
