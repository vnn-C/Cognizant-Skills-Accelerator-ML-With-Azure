Appellant having amended his account in the County Court, and added thereto items not embraced in the account sued upon in the Justice Court, he ought not to be permitted to •complain of the action of the trial court in permitting appellee to plead in offset to these new items matters not pleaded in the Justice Court. Appellant occupies the inconsistent position of violating the rules of practice, and at the same time invoking these rules against appellee. This he can not do.</p>

We think this was error. It has been settled that article 316 of the Revised Statutes, which prohibits any setoff or counter-claim from being set up by the defendant in the County Court which was not pleaded in the court below, in cases brought by certiorari, applies as well to a case taken to the County Court by appeal.

This, however, seems to have been done without objection from appellee, and we are of opinion that this furnishes no sufficient reason for overrul<a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>ing the objection of appellant. We do not wish, however, to be understood as holding that the amendment' made by appellant was subject to exception had it been interposed by appellee. As to this we express no opinion.</p>
    <p id="b123-4" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[153,527,1301,490]]]'>One of the items in appellee’s counter-claim was 820, claimed to have been paid by A. S. Connellee, a brother of appellee, to appellant, and to prove this item said Connellee was allowed to testify in reference to its payment, over the objection of appellant, as follows: “I do not know anything from my own personal knowledge, but I do from circumstances. My wife told me that I borrowed 820 from her, and that at the time I borrowed it I told her I wanted it to pay Dr. Downtain for brother Charley; but I do not know whether I paid it or not, or anything further about it.” That this evidence was pure hearsay and inadmissible, we think quite too clear for argument.</p>
