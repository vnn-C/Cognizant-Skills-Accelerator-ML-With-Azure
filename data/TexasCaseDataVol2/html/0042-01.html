Damages — Impaired Capacity for Pursuing Occupation.— Plaintiff alleged that prior to his injuries he earned $1500 per year, and by his injury was made a cripple for life, and incapacitated from ever pursuing his occupation of stockman, which' was the only business for which he was qualified; that he was forty-six years old, in good health, and would probably live twenty-five years longer. Demurrer to these allegations was properly overruled. It was proper to show that he was engaged in a particular business, and the loss from incapacity to pursue it.</p>

It was held in Railway v.

Limiting Effect of Such Evidence.—The following charge properly limits the effect of evidence touching plaintiff’s age and expectancy of life: “ The evidence adduced touching the age, probable expectancy of life, and earnings of the plaintiff, may be considered by the jury, if they find for the plaintiff, along with all the other evidence, in arriving at what loss, if any, plaintiff has sustained from diminished earnings since the injury, and loss of earning power; but the jury will not understand from this that they can from such facts fix a basis of computation without regard to plaintiff's capacity, if any, to earn money since the injuries and in the future; nor are such facts,-if proved, to be considered otherwise than as circumstances to be weighed by the jury with all the other evidence, in arriving at a fair and just pecuniary compensation for the loss to plaintiff, if any, resulting directly from the injuries sustained.”</p>

    <p id="b72-6" data-blocks='[["BL_72.6",72,[243,472,1299,288]]]'>1. At night, on May 9, 1885, the plaintiff, J. C. Cooper, on his return from the town of Wharton, where he had been attending court, to his home near Alleyton, Colorado County, purchased a ticket from the defendant company at Rosenberg, on the line of defendant’s road, for passage over said railway from Rosenberg to Alleyton, going west, and entered the cars for the purpose of going to Alleyton.</p>
    <p id="b72-7" data-blocks='[["BL_72.7",72,[241,771,1305,834]]]'>2. Plaintiff had been charged by some one with a message to be delivered to Tom Jones, who was camped with his crowd of cow drivers at Randon, which was an intermediate station between Rosenberg and Alley-ton, about seven miles west of Rosenberg. When the train reached Ran-don it stopped in a position so as to leave the last two cars of the train alongside of the depot platform. Plaintiff was in the next to the last car, and as soon as the train stopped he got off the rear end of the car on the platform and stood near the car steps and called for Jones, and delivered the message for him to some one in the crowd who had answered-that Jones was asleep. Plaintiff turned to get back on the train, which was standing still, and just as he leaned forward and seized one of the iron rails put on the coach for the purpose of assisting passengers to board the train, with his right hand, and was in the act of seizing the other rail with his left hand, the train started without any warning, and plaintiff was thrown down under the train, and the wheels of the cars ran over his foot and ankle, crushing the same so that the foot had to be amputated below the knee.</p>
    <p id="b72-8" data-blocks='[["BL_72.8",72,[239,1618,1300,636]]]'>3. Plaintiff testified, that the train was suddenly and violently started, thereby suddenly and violently jerking him down and under the train, about three or four fqet east from the west end of the platform, and between the train and the platform; and that no notice whatever was given that the train was about to start before it was started. Neither was the engine bell rung nor the whistle blown, nor did the conductor say <em>“ </em>all aboard.” If notice had been .given, plaintiff would have had a plenty of time to get back on the train in safety. Witnesses for the defendant testified, that the train was not started with a sudden jerk, because Miller couplings were used, and when they are used the train does not start with a jerk. They testified to their belief that notice of starting was given, but could not say so positively. We find that the train was started quickly and without warning.</p>

A flag station is a station at which the trains of the defendant are not stopped unless there is some one on the train who desires to get off at the station, or the train is flagged by some one at the station desiring to get on. It is not the custom to stop unless the <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>train has been flagged, or there is some one aboard to be put off there. At the time of the accident there was at Eandon a depot, platform, and waiting room; also a section house, stock pens, and a water tank; but no agent or telegraph operator. The stop made on the night of the accident at Eandon was for water. The train had not been signalled for any one to get on, and there was no passenger to get off. Defendant’s employes who were operating the train did not know that plaintiff had gotten off. When the train drew near to the station the engine whistled. Plaintiff had often gotten off and on defendant’s train at Eandon, and never had to notify the conductor or signal the train. He always considered it a regular passenger station.</p>
    <p id="b73-5" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[138,880,1302,1182]]]'>5. Plaintiff was taken to Eichmond for treatment on the morning of May 10, where he had skilled physicians and surgeons to attend him. His foot and ankle became so badly inflamed and irritated that on May 15 it became necessary to amputate his leg about half-way between the ankle and knee. He was confined to his bed about two months, and suffered greatly. His expense for board, medical treatment, nurses’ hire, and incidental expenses in getting cured, amounted to 81040. Plaintiff’s occupation was that of a stockman, and had been such from early boyhood. He was 46 years of age, and was strong and healthy, and was in good health at the time of the trial, and in a robust condition except as to his amputated leg. His expectation of life at the time of the accident, according to mortality tables, was twenty-three years. He had not pursued any other occupation than that of stockman, and his education was limited. He was expert in his business, and earned from 81500 to 82000 annually, besides attending to his own cattle and horses and other business about his place. Stockmen testified that a man as he was before the injury ought to earn from 8800 to 81000 a year, but that his capacity as a stockman had been destroyed. By reason of the injury plaintiff’s earning capacity was shown to be practically destroyed. He could not do anything in the line of stockman or boss cow driver, because he could not get about, and mount his horse and ride as before. He testified that he could not plow nor hoe, nor perform any other labor he thought himself capable of doing; that since the injury he had not been able to perform any kind of labor, nor had he made any money since the accident.</p>

The loss is the difference between what the annual earnings were before the injury and what they would be, if any, with the diminished capacity; and when it has <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>been shown that the injury is permanent, as was done in the case of the plaintiff, it is proper to show what the expectation of life is, so as to enable the jury to form an estimate as nearly as possible of what the damage or loss may be. Hence there could be no error in admitting evidence to show what the plaintiff’s occupation or business was, and what his annual, earnings from his occupation had been prior to the injury. Wade v.

It is impossible for a jury to determine with any degree of exactness what damage has been sustained in cases of personal injuries, and it must be approximated by the aid of such evidence as will tend to show what it is; and having first ascertained how much the capacity for earning money has been diminished by an annual estimate, it would then become a proper subject of inquiry, how long the plaintiff would likely live. The testimony of the actuary, that a healthy man forty-six years old would probably live twenty-three and four one-hundredths years, was admissible. We are aware that it was held in Railway v. Douglass, 69 Texas, 694, that the rule seemed to be that when death results from the injury, or when the evidence tends to show that the earning capacity is entirely destroyed, the testimony is admissible, otherwise not. In support of this proposition the court cited, Pierce on Railroads, 297; Wilson v. Railway, <a href="/iowa/38/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="38 Iowa 364" data-case-ids="2303026" data-case-paths="/iowa/38/0364-01">38 Iowa, 364</a>; McDonald v. Railway, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Iowa%20139" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="26 Iowa 139">26 Iowa, 139</a>. Mr. Pierce states the proposition broadly, that “in actions for injuries not resulting in death, life tables are not competent evidence of the probable injury;” but he is not sustained by any authority to which we have had access. The case in 26 Iowa, supra, is where there were injuries to the wife, “ permanent in their nature, and likely to disable her during her life from rendering effectual service to her husband and family in the discharge of her household duties; and that in consequence a woman had been and was, and probably <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>would have to be, employed to do the work she had been accustomed to perform.” Held, that under the circumstances there was no error in the admission of the Carlisle tables to show the expectancy of the life of the wife.</p>

Notwithstanding the case of Railway v. Douglass, supra, we are constrained to hold that under the circumstances the evidence was admissible. See rule intimated by Judge Bonner in Railway v.

The refusal of the following requested instruction by the court has been assigned as error: “ The contract of a railway company as a carrier is to carry a passenger to his point of destination, and not to afford him <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>opportunities to leave the car at intermediate stations, except at stopping places for refreshments; and if a passenger alights at such intermediate stations or stopping places, unless the servants of the carrier actually know the fact, or unless the servants of the carrier are ignorant through negligence, they are not bound to more than their usual care and watchfulness in starting the trains from such stations or stopping places. And if you believe from the evidence that plaintiff, Cooper, got off the train, at night at Eandon, an intermediate station or stopping place, and not the place he was bound for; that the train stopped there for water only; that it was not a regular passenger station; that the train men knew that no other passenger was to get on or off there at that time, and that was a fact; that the train men did not know that Cooper had gotten off there, and their ignorance was not through negligence on their part, and that they started the train from Eandon in the usual careful way, without any negligence on their part, you will find for defendant.”</p>

The exception that the passenger may alight for refreshments is well established; but we do not see, when the train stops at a station, why a passenger may not alight, using proper care, for a proper purpose, as speaking to some one on the platform, as in this case. This would be a reasonable implication from the contract of carriage. Again, it has been held, that when a train stops at a passenger depot there is an implied invitation to alight, and in starting the train again every reasonable precaution should be taken to prevent injury to any passenger who should alight, whilst getting off or back on the train, such as giving warning of the starting of the train by customary signals.</p>
    <p id="b76-6" data-blocks='[["BL_76.6",76,[268,1840,1302,685]]]'>We do not think that the evidence here presents a case coming within the decisions holding that when the train stops elsewhere than at a station, as at a water tank or upon a side track, when the stop is made for the purposes of the railroad alone, and the passenger leaves the cars, he acts at his peril, and that his own negligence will prevent a recovery. It may be true that Eandon was only a flag station, but it was a station for passengers to get on and off, and there was a depot and platform there, and the undisclosed purpose of the train men to stop there for water alone-could not change the character of the station; and if the plaintiff exercised care in attempting to get aboard the train after he had alighted, he was guilty of no a'ct of negligence that would prevent a recovery for injuries caused by the negligence of the defendant’s servants in starting the train. These views we do not think are in conflict with Railway v. Foreman, 73 Texas, 314.</p>

If the jury believe from the evidence that defendant’s employes observed such care and skill in starting the train as an ordinarily prudent person in like business would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances, or if the jury believe that the injuries complained of were not the natural and probable consequences of starting the train as done, nor such consequence as defendant’s employes in charge might reasonably have anticipated as likely to flow from such starting of the train, then return a verdict for defendant.”</p>

So there could be no error in refusing to give the instruction informing the jury as to the nature of the contract and the effect of a stoppage at an intermediate station, because the instruction admits the obligation of defendant to the same degree of care as contained in the charge of the court, and the case at least, depends on the fact as to whether or not defendant’s servants used due care in starting the train.</p>
