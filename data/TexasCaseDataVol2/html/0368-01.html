A survey upon this file was made by said surveyor,, and returned to the General Land Office July 26,1882, where it remained until August 4, 1882, when the Commissioner, without having placed his file mark upon it, returned the field notes to the surveyor of Wilbarger County, because of defects therein, and because there was no evidence on file in his office that Wilbarger County had organized as a separate land district. This survey was again returned to the Land Office by the surveyor of Wilbarger County on October 13, 1882, and on October 23,1882, the Commissioner again returned it to the surveyor on account of defects therein. On January 17, 1883, appellant Sams again returned this survey to the General Land Office, and on. February 26, 1883, the Commissioner returned it to him, because the survey was incorrect. The survey was again returned to the General Land Office July 12,1883, when it was marked “filed” by the Commissioner; but this filing was more than twelve months after the date of the survey, which was made May 5, 1882.</p>

The surveyor of Wilbarger County also assisted in making this survey, and recorded the field notes in his office. Upon this survey patent was issued to Creager on December 22, 1884.</p>

Appellant Marsalis claims under this location. The record does not show affirmatively that this last named certificate was ever filed with the county surveyor of Wilbarger County; but from the fact that the survey was made and returned to the General Land Office, we conclude that it was properly accompanied with the certificate.</p>

The title of this act is as follows: “An act establishing and prescribing the manner of ascertaining the boundaries of counties.” Then follows a full and complete revision of our law upon the subject of establishing the boundary lines of counties, and the manner in which they shall be surveyed; and section 10 provides, that “Before any county in this State not already organized as a land district under existing law shall be recognized . as such, the County Court shall cause the boundary lines of the county to be surveyed and marked, and the field notes and map of such survey duly recorded and returned to the General Land Office as provided in this act.” It is not contended that this section of the law had been complied with at the time the surveyor of Wilbarger County made the surveys under which appellants claim; but it is contended that <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>this section of the law is unconstitutional; and also, when construed in connection with section 1, the survey called for therein was not required to be made until it was ordered by the County Court or by the Commissioner of the General Land Office.</p>
    <p id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[275,529,1301,436]]]'>Without entering into an extended discussion of the question, we are of opinion that section 10 wras sufficiently embraced within the subject and title of the act, and is therefore constitutional. The reasons which lead us to this conclusion will be found discussed at length in the cases of Railway v. Smith, 54 Texas, 10; Stone v. Brown, 54 Texas, 341; Day Co. v. The State, 68 Texas, 542. The subject of this act is the establishing of the boundary lines of the different counties in the State, and we think the Legislature in the same act could well provide the consequences to be attached to a failure to comply with its provisions.</p>
    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.6",398,[271,978,1302,329]]]'>We are also of opinion, that section 1 of the act was intended to apply to eases xvhere the boundary lines of counties had never been established in compliance with its provisions, although they may have previously been organized as a separate land district; and section 10 was intended to require the boundary lines of all unorganized counties in future to be well defined under its provisions before being recognized as a separate land district.</p>
    <p id="b398-7" data-blocks='[["BL_398.7",398,[269,1326,1302,587]]]'>It follows, therefore, from what we have said, that we are of opinion that the surveyor of Wilbarger County, at the time the surveys for both of the appellants were made, had no authority to make the same, and in such eases it has been held that his acts are void. Cox v. Railway, 68 Texas, 226. Article 3822, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, provides, that “Any unorganized county or newly created district which may fail or refuse to organize as a separate land district as provided by law, shall continue to form a part of the district to which it was formerly attached,” etc. From the findings of fact, it will be seen that Wilbarger County formerly belonged to the Clay Land District; and as appellee had his survey made by the surveyor of that district, the patent issued thereon constituted the superior right to the land.</p>
