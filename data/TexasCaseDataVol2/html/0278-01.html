When the latter place was reached the train did not stop, but slackened its speed, so that two male passengers alighted in safety in appellee's presence. She was standing on the platform waiting for the cars to stop. Seeing that they were not stopping, she asked an employe of appellant, whom she supposed to be the conductor, if she should jump off. and he directed her <em>to </em>wait until the train got opposite the depot. The train continued to move with increasing speed, and finally appellant’s servant told her she would have to jump off, which she did, receiving the injuries for which she seeks compensation. Appellant was guilty of negligence in not stopping the train, and judgment is affirmed.</p>

In view of these facts, we conclude that appellant was guilty of negligence in not stopping its train at the station, and that appellee was not, under the circumstances testified to by her and her witnesses, guilty of negligence in trying to alight, so as to preclude her from recovering.</p>
