    <p id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.7",276,[258,1131,1307,1285]]]'>We believe the petition states a cause of action. The petition does not meet the test ordinarily required in stating a cause of action upon a promissory note and open account. It does not allege that Benito Lopez became bound by reason of the execution and delivery of the note; nor does it set out the items constituting the account or give a bill of particulars of the amounts and items, but refers to an account filed in the papers in the case, showing the several items thereof. The same degree of certainty is required in stating a cause of action against appellee as the representative of the Lopez estate, in seeking to establish a debt against it, or in seeking to make appellees liable for the payment of the claim, as would exist in seeking a recovery against Lopez if he was alive and a party to the suit. But the want of allegations in the respects noticed is cured by the averments of the petition which charge that the appellees allowed and approved the claims sued upon. We know of no law that requires the survivor of the community estate when so administered to allow and approve a claim, nor does the law require such action by the county judge as in other administrations, and the effect of the allegations that the claims were allowed by the appellee, the survivor of the community estate, and approved by the county judge, would not have the effect of merging said claims into a judgment, as would be the effect in a regular administration under the statute; but the effect of such allegations would be, if true, that appellee admits liability upon the note and account sued upon. It is similar to a cause of action based upon an account stated. The fact that the amount has been admitted or agreed upon, relieves the plaintiff from the necessity of proving the items constituting the basis of his claim.</p>

    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[134,486,1305,535]]]'>It appears from the averments that the survivor of the community received assets of the estate largely in excess of the debts of the estate, and that she has misapplied and squandered property of the estate in value much more than all of the debts due by it. The petition seeks to recover of her and her sureties on her bond the amount of debts sued upon; alleging that the waste and misapplication of the property of the estate creates a breach of the bond. The fact that the administratrix has violated the terms of the bond by squandering and wasting property of the estate in value far in excess of all the debts due by it, renders it unnecessary to state to what class the claim belongs, as such facts show the appellees are liable for the claims sued upon as well as all other debts due from the estate.</p>

Such is evidently the construction placed upon the law by the case of Huppman v. Schmidt, 65 Texas, 585, although the controversy there was between distributees of the estate and the survivor administering the community estate and his bondsmen.</p>
    <p id="b277-9" data-blocks='[["BL_277.9",277,[133,2077,1301,434]]]'>There is nothing in article 2176 that expressly confines the creditor to the remedy there given. It simply provides a method of ascertaining the condition of the estate and if the facts exist that authorize the creditor to sue. The survivor when administering the community estate is free from the control of the Probate Court, and acquires over the property of the estate the same right of management, control, and disposition possessed by a managing partner during the life of the partnership.

And when its conditions and terms are violated to the injury of the creditor, he has the right to go into any court that has jurisdiction of the amount, as is provided for other litigants, and determine his rights there, and is entitled to all the rights and privileges granted other litigants. The facts that he has a claim against the estate and that it is unpaid, and that circumstances have arisen that make the survivor of the community and her sureties liable for its payment, are facts that can only properly be adjudicated in a court that has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit; and in ascertaining if these facts are true, it is a valuable privilege that the parties have in having them passed upon by the verdict of a jury.
