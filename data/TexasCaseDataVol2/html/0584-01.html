County Court May Foreclose Attachment Liens on Land.— A citizen of Georgia sued another citizen of that State in the County Court of Montgomery County, Texas, to recover upon promissory notes, and foreclose an attachment upon land in said county. The County Court had jurisdiction to cause the levy of the writ upon the land, and to enforce the levy by foreclosure.</p>

Right of Nonresident to Sue Nonresident.—One nonresident may, by attachment proceeding, subject the property of another nonresident, who is his debtor, to the payment of his debt, in any court of competent jurisdiction in this State. By the levy of its writ the court acquires jurisdiction over the property, and could subject it to the payment of such debt as the plaintiff might establish.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b610-9" data-blocks='[["BL_610.8",610,[255,952,1302,283]]]'>3. Appearance by Nonresident.—Defendant appeared and excepted to the jurisdiction of the court, and moved to quash the attachment, stating that he appeared for the purposes expressed therein alone; and in his other answer he stated that it was filed without any intention of waving his other pleas, and that he thus answered to the merits only in the event they should be overruled. This pleading of the defendant entered an appearance, and gave the court jurisdiction over his person.</p>

He appeared and excepted to the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground that the petition showed that both plaintiff and defendant were nonresidents, and the court had no jurisdiction over their persons and none to foreclose an attachment lien on land, and could therefore acquire none over the property attached.
