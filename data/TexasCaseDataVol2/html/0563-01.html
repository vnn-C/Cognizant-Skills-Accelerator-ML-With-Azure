The will gave R. power to sell certain realty, but did not exempt the executor from'the control of the Probate Court. Both the act of 184G and 1848 authorized the exercise by executors of powers of sale conferred by wills; confirmation was only necessary of such sales as had to be authorized by the court. Valid powers of sale given to executors by will are not revoked by the probate of the will, but may be exercised though the administration of the estate is not by other provisions of the will taken out of the Probate Court. R. therefore had power to sell and convey the land without the sanction of the court.</p>

Powers that Can Not be Delegated.—The land was sold in 1855 by T., who assumed to act as attorney in fact of R., though no power of attorney was shown. A discretionary power of sale such as was given R. by this will can not be delegated by the donee or trustee to another. Negotiations and arrangements for a sale in all its details having been made by the trustee himself, he may commit the execution of acts which are merely mechanical to another, and this includes the mere act of executing and delivering a deed of conveyance when everything else is done by the trustee.</p>

Same—Supporting Evidence.—A conveyance by one claiming to act as attorney in fact of the donee or trustee of such a power as this, where the sale was neither made nor ratified by the trustee, would be void; and in the ease above supposed the production of the deed executed by the attorney in fact would not be sufficient evidence of title, but evidence would be required of the circumstances under which it was made, to authorize and sustain it.</p>

For a third of a century the land has been openly possessed, used, and enjoyed by claimants under T.’s deed, and appellants have not in any way asserted a claim to the property, which was theirs but for this conveyance. They must be held to have known of such claim, and to have acquiesced in it. The court below correctly presumed the existence of a valid power in T.</p>
