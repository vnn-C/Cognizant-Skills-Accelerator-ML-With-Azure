Appellant contends that the petition fails to state a cause of action; because, first, no conspiracy was alleged; second, under the facts alleged, appellant had the right “ to prohibit its employes or servants from attending any place of resort, such as a saloon and boarding house combined, under penalty of being discharged,” and therefore did no wrong to appellee in issuing the order; third, the business alleged to have been injured was not averred to have been lawful; and fourth, there was no allegation that prior to the alleged wrongful acts of appellant appellee enjoyed the custom for the loss of which recovery is sought, and that he lost it through such wrongful act.</p>
    <p id="b106-4" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[288,328,1301,786]]]'>
      <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>1. The first point seems to be, that the term “ boycott” imports a conspiracy, and that the use of that term rendered it necessary for the pleader to show that a conspiracy existed. Whether or not this word has acquired, in modern usage, a meaning sufficiently definite for a court to take notice of when used in pleading, without explanation, is a question not very material to this case. (See a discussion of the point in cases referred to in 2 American and English Encyclopedia of Law, 512.) The term, so far as its import is developed, does not seem very applicable to the transaction alleged in the petition. But the legal characteristics of the cause of action are to be determined from the act alleged, and not from the name by which the pleader calls it. If that act is in law such as to give rise to a cause of action, the naming of it does not alter its character. The objection to the petition, that it does not allege a conspiracy, is not well taken, if the act charged against appellant was a legal wrong to appellee, for which he may maintain an action. The act might be committed as well by one as by many.</p>
    <p id="b106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[286,1125,1299,338]]]'>It is held in the case of Delz v. Norman, 80 Texas, 403, that a mere conspiracy is not actionable unless the act done thereby would be actionable if done by one singly. Whether this is true as broadly as it is stated or not (Bishop on Noncontract Law, section 357, et seq.), it can not be doubted that an injury to one’s trade which will subject the guilty party to liability for damages resulting therefrom may be inflicted without a conspiracy. This brings us to the second objection.</p>
    <p id="b106-6" data-blocks='[["BL_106.6",106,[285,1474,1299,337]]]'>2. Did appellant have the right to prohibit its servants from patronizing appellee’s hotel and saloon ? If in issuing the order or threat it only exercised a legal right, it may be admitted that appellee can not complain, though it resulted in loss to him, whatever may have been the motive with which the act was done. If appellant would have had the right to discharge its servants for doing the forbidden things, then it must follow that it could lawfully notify them that it would exercise it. -</p>
    <p id="b106-7" data-blocks='[["BL_106.7",106,[286,1824,1298,234]]]'>It had the same right to discharge its servants as all masters have under similar conditions. This right was not to dismiss the servants arbitrarily or capriciously, but for reasonable causes only. Were the acts, the doing of which appellant declared to its servants should be the cause of their discharge, such as would justify the action which was threatened ?</p>
    <p id="b106-8" data-blocks='[["BL_106.8",106,[286,2069,1298,290]]]'>The allegation is, that the employes were threatened with discharge if they “in any way patronized plaintiff, either by eating at his house or drinking at his bar.” We think it too plain, that, as thus stated, there would have been no just ground for discharging the servants for doing what they were thus forbidden to do. This is charged to have been done maliciously, with intent to injure plaintiff.</p>

Appellant might doubtless adopt appropriate measures with its employes, to prevent troublesome litigation with plaintiff, but it could not interfere with his legitimate business in order to do so. How it was nececessary to forbid patronage of that business in order to prevent litigation is not made to appear. It is shown that some of the employes in trading with appellee had transferred to him their papers, by which their right to receive wages from appellant was in some way evidenced, and that harassing suits had been brought by appellee from time to time upon such claims. Had such assignments alone been forbidden, upon penalty of discharge to the employes, a different question would be before us. Such is not the case.</p>
    <p id="b108-5" data-blocks='[["BL_108.5",108,[280,944,1305,1277]]]'>There is no assignment which questions the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict, except the seventh, and that is too general to raise any question concerning the finding of the jury, save the allowance of exemplary damages. We have considered the evidence bearing upon this, point, and conclude as a fact that the act of appellant was not done maliciously, nor with reckless or wanton disregard of appellee’s rights; and that therefore the verdict for exemplary damages is not sustained. There are in the record two bills of exception, complaining of language used by appellee’s counsel in addressing the jury. As to the first, it is shown that the court checked and rebuked the counsel and properly instructed the jury. In the other instance counsel was permitted to state to the jury that the reason appellee had not brought forward more of the employes of appellant who had been discharged for patronizing appellee or had withheld their custom from him, was that they had been discharged by the defendant, and had gone like migratory birds and could not be found by plaintiff. Objections made by appellant’s counsel to this were overruled, the court stating in explanation of the bill of exceptions that there was evidence that the employes “ were ever transient, changing continually.” Such evidence is not found in the statement of facts. There was no evidence that defendant had discharged its employes, nor that plaintiff could not have found them, and the statement ought not to have been allowed. The fact stated was not one calculated to arouse passion or prejudice, and as the verdict is not attacked as not being supported by the evidence as to actual damages, in view of the disposition we will make of the case, it will not be necessary to notice this error further than to condemn it.</p>
