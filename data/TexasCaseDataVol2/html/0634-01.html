She duly presented the ticket to such agent at S.. who wrongfully refused to sign and stamp it; and when she presented it to defendant’s train conductor on the return trip, he refused to honor it, treated her with great rudeness, and as she had not money with which to pay her fare, exacted the deposit of her watch as security for the fare. <em>JETeld, </em>that the wife was not a trespasser on defendant’s train on the return trip, her contract right of passage not being lost because of the agent’s refusal to sign and stamp the ticket, but that such refusal was well pleaded and proved by plaintiff, in connection with the other facts, as germane to his cause of action in damages for the wrongs suffered by his wife.</p>

The averments of the petition show that the ticket was good, and all that it needed was his signature and stamp. The tender and offer of performance of the contract by Mrs. Martino, and the refusal of the agent to observe it, did not relieve the appellant of its duty to transport her to Dallas. It was the duty of the agent, as shown by the terms of the contract, to sign and stamp it when presented by Mrs. Martino for such purpose Her right to be carried as a passenger on appellant’s train was not lost by reason of the arbitrary refusal of the agent to perform and observe a stipulation of the contract that his-principal had entered into.</p>

The passenger who complies with his contract does not lose his right to transportation because of the error or mistake of the agent in failing or refusing to do that which is necessary to show the passenger’s right.

The charge presents the entire case to the jury growing out of the facts that show the wrongful acts of the agent at St. Louis in refusing to sign and stamp the ticket, and the wrongful acts of the conductors in their conduct towards Mrs. Martino. It leaves them to fix the cause and effect of all these acts from the beginning to the end of the conduct of the parties, at St. Louis and to Denison. We think it was proper that all of these facts should be considered by the jury. The conduct of the agent at St. Louis is admissible for the purpose of showing the effect it produced, and further to negative the fact that Mrs. Martino was a trespasser and to show her right on the train. The case of Mosher v. Railway, 21 American and English Railway Cases, 283, relied on by appellant, is unlike this case. There the purchaser of the round trip ticket that was required to be stamped and signed by the agent did not present it to the agent, and consequently he did not refuse <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>to sign or stamp it. There was no refusal by the agent to do what was agreed should be done that amounted to a violation of the contract. The agent was not present at the ticket office when the holder of the ticket desired that it should be signed and stamped. Without seeing the agent, he boarded the train with the ticket unstamped and unsigned. It was refused by the conductor. In the case before us, there is a violation of the contract, a refusal of the carrier to sign and stamp the ticket as it had agreed to do.</p>

Cooper, 71 Texas, 507, that pain and mental anguish suffered by the husband on account of injuries inflicted upon the wife can not be considered as an element of damages in a suit to recover damages flowing from such injuries sustained by the wife. While it may have been error in the abstract to have overruled the demurrer, and to have refused the charge, we do not believe it was such error as would require a reversal of this case. The court, in its. charge, pointedly instructed the jury that as an element of damages they could only consider the mental anguish and sense of shame, if any, suffered by Mrs. Martino by reason of the treatment of the conductors, etc. The effect of this charge was to eliminate from the mind of the jury the consideration of any question as to mental anguish and suffering by the husband. The effect of the charge was to piirge the record of any issue of mental suffering experienced by the husband, as presented either by the pleadings or evidence. In fact, giving consideration to all the allegations of the petition, it is doubtful if any claim for the mental suffering of the husband is presented. The evident purpose was to make the sickness, pain, and anguish experienced by the wife the sole basis of the action for damages. It is not seriously contended that the evidence presents a state of facts that show that the husband relied upon his mental distress as an element of damages, or that he sought recovery for such, reason. But upon the contrary, the only logical conclusion that can be-drawn from the evidence is, that it was the anguish and suffering experienced by the wife that the jury considered, or could consider, in rendering a verdict.</p>

We think the evidence sufficient to support the judgment, and we do not believe the verdict excessive. If the evidence introduced in behalf of the plaintiff is true (which the jury evidently so considered, and we see no reason to doubt the correctness of their conclusion), it presents a case of gross insults and indignities inflicted upon her by a brutal conductor in the employment of appellant,. <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>and while engaged in the performance of service within the line of his duty.

This, after she had exhibited her ticket and explained to him why it was not signed and stamped by the St. Louis agent, and after she had <em>offered </em>to identify herself, and after be had received from the other conductor the baggage check which she had delivered as collateral to secure the payment of her fare to Dallas.

There is no rule in a case of this kind that determines when the amount awarded is excessive. As said in the case of Railway v. Gilbert, 64 Texas, 541: “ It is difficult to compute in figures what sum will repay the plaintiff for the gross insults and physical and mental pain to which she has been subjected by the misconduct and rudeness of the employes of a railway company as detailed by the witnesses in this case. The value of the time lost by her might be estimated, but the damages for her pain of body and mortification of mind must be left largely to the discretion of the jury. When they have not apparently abused this discretion, and no outside influences have been used to excite their passions or prejudices, the result of that discretion must control the judgment of this court on appeal.”</p>

It was the appellant, through its agent at St. Louis, that violated the contract evidenced by the ticket, by its wrongful refusal to stamp the same when presented to it; and it was the appellant, through its conductors, that wrongfully refused to accept the unstamped ticket, when this defect was attributable to its own fault and not that of appellee’s wife.
