    <p class="headnotes" id="b574-11" data-blocks='[["BL_574.11",574,[253,1359,1300,574]]]'>A judgment in the Justice Court was appealed and dismissed. Then a certiorari was sued out. The question is, was it rightly quashed by the County Court? It is settled law, that the writ of certiorari will only be granted when the petition shows a meritorious action or defense, which the petition in this case does. But the reason given for not urging the defense below is, that appellant had no information of the nature of appellee's claim save such as could be obtained from an inspection of plaintiff's account filed in the Justice Court, and from that appellant was justified in believing that the claim was based upon the refusal of appellant to allow plaintiff to ride on its road by virtue of a ticket purchased in San Antonio; and knowing that appellant had no agent in San Antonio for sale of tickets, appellant had no reason to suspect that appellee upon the trial would swear, as he did, that he purchased the ticket described in his account from an agent of the appellant, and said testimony was a surprise to appellant. <em>Held, </em>not a good excuse, and that the certiorari was properly dismissed.</p>
