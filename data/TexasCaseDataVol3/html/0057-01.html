    <p class="headnotes" id="b83-13" data-blocks='[["BL_83.13",83,[151,1706,1296,318]]]'>1. Amendment—Same Cause of Action.—Attachment suit on a promissory note executed hy a partnership firm. Affidavit by defendant denyingthat he was a member of the firm as alleged. The plaintiff amended, alleging liability by the defendant to pay the note, for that he had for a valuable consideration assumed and promised to pay the same. Trial resulted in judgment for plaintiff for amount of the note; the trial court, however, refused to foreclose the attachment. This was error. The amendment did not set up a new cause of action, and foreclosure should have been decreed.</p>

From this adverse ruling appellant appeals.</p>

The amended petition does not set up a new cause of action. In this State we look to the substance of the issue and the facts as pleaded, and not to the form of the action, in ascertaining the nature of the plaintiff’s demand and the relief that should be extended. The liability of the appellee for the payment of the note was the nature of the appellant’s demand in both the original and <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>amended petitions. The note was the subject matter of the suit, and to enforce its payment this suit was instituted. The effect of the amended petition was to state that the appellee was liable upon the note, but his liability resulted from a state of facts different from that stated in the original petition. The extent of his liability as presented in both, petitions is the same. The promise by appellee to assume the liability of Eoss upon the note simply brings about a novation of parties, and his liability is to the same extent as the law imposed upon Eoss by reason of his original promise to pay as evidenced by the terms of the note. We do not think the amended petition set up a new cause of action. Landa v. Obert, 78 Texas, 46; 44 Texas, 152; 1 Am. and Eng.
