Riggs; alleging that said lands of plaintiffs and in controversy had an exceptional value because of being adjacent to the city of Belton, and mapped and platted for sale as town lots, and the same could be sold for a high value were it not for the fact that defendants set up title thereto and brought their claims to the notice of those desiring to purchase, and that those desiring to purchase would not purchase the same, with the expectation of making valuable "improvements thereon, when the title was questioned.</p>
