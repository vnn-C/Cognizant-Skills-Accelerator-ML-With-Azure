Measure of Damages for Delaying Freight.—In cases of ordinary shipment of goods to a merchant of the kind in which he deals, whén there is no fact shown that would put the carrier upon notice of the fact that the goods were designed for a special purpose other than is inferred from such character of shipments, the measure of damages for delay in the delivery is the difference in the value of the goods at the time they should have arrived, and at the time they did arrive. It was error to allow rents for delayed machinery, delayed under such circumstances.</p>

There is no evidence in the record showing that the appellant, or any of its partnership lines, during the time of the transportation of the machine, had any notice or knowledge of any facts that would put it upon contemplation or inquiry that the machine was to be used for the purpose of operating a gin during the cotton season of that year. This fact is the distinguishing feature between this case and that of the Gulf, Colorado <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Railway Company v. Gilbert,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> this day decided by us. In other respects the two cases are similar.</p>
    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.7",615,[146,1019,1303,335]]]'>We understand the rule to be, that for delay in cases of ordinary shipments of goods to a merchant of the kind in which he deals, when there is no fact shown that would put the carrier upon contemplation or knowledge of the fact that the goods are designed for a special purpose and a definite use other than is inferred from such character of shipments, the measure of damages is the difference in the value of the goods from the time they should have arrived and the time they did arrive.</p>

No such demurrer being ad<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>dressed to the petition, there was no error in admitting the evidence of the witnesses showing the rental value of the machine.</p>

But admitting such evidence as the rental value of the machine does not authorize plaintiff to recover such rental value unless he goes further and shows that tlie intended use of the machine was known to the shipper.</p>
