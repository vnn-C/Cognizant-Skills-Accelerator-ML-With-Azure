    <p id="b586-8" data-blocks='[["BL_586.12",586,[276,1280,1299,292]]]'>“ The original petition was filed on the 14th day of February, 1890, and on the 4th day of March,. 1891, appellant filed first amended petition, and alleged, in substance, that on the 4th day of January, 1889, the plaintiff was possessed of and owned certain town lots located in the town of Amarillo, Potter County, Texas, described as follows:” (Here follow a specific description and valuation of the lands.)</p>

Johnson &amp; Co., in the District Court of Potter County, wherein it was claimed that the alleged firm of F. G. Johnson <em>&amp; </em>Co. was indebted to E. M. Tillman in the sum of $1419.85.</p>

    <p id="b586-11" data-blocks='[["BL_586.15",586,[272,2131,1302,385]]]'>“ That on the said 4th day of January, 1889, H. M. Friend, agent of the said E. M. Tillman, by direction of the said Tillman, procured an attachment to be issued against F. G. Johnson &amp; Co., and had the same levied upon the property herein before described to satisfy his claim against the alleged firm of F. G. Johnson &amp; Co., and that said agent H. M. Friend, acting under instructions from defendant E. M.

      <em>‘ ‘ </em>That said property at the time it was seized under said attachment was reasonably worth the sum herein before stated ($2155), and that by reason of an incoming of settlers and the consequent growth of the town, it rapidly increased in value, so that on the 1st day of March, 1889, its value had become enhanced 100 per cent. That on the said 1st day of March, 1889, said property was in great demand, and plaintiff had at that time divers opportunities to sell said property at said enhanced prices, and would have accepted offers to purchase said property at said enhanced price, but was prevented from selling the same by reason of said property being held under defendant’s attachment, and by reason of the cloud ■cast upon the title to the same by levy of said attachment. That said property on the 1st day of March, 1889, was reasonably worth and could have been sold by plaintiff for the sum of $4310, had it not then been held under attachment of defendant.</p>

That but for the levy of said writ of attachment upon said property, he could and would have sold said lots to the said parties for the average price of $38.50 per lot.</p>

    <p id="b588-8" data-blocks='[["BL_588.8",588,[310,1475,957,38]]]'>We think the court erred in sustaining this exception.</p>
