Fountain requested extension for one year, and he (Brown) <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>agreed to it, if it should be agreeable to all the parties, and he, Fountain, would pay the additional 3 per cent in advance, and the 12 per cent interest then due; but that it must be with the consent of all the parties, as he knew if the time were extended without their consent, they, being sureties, would be released; that Fountain then paid the interest due and the 3 per cent additional, according to the original contract. That about June 18, 1884, Fountain again asked for another year’s extension and would pay the 18 per cent. Plaintiff thought he could not do so, but replied that if he did, it would be under the old contract, and that the sureties must consent to it; that afterwards, during plaintiff’s same visit to Coleman, Fountain paid him the 12 per cent interest then due, the 3 per cent bonus in advance, and §1100 on the principal, and plaintiff extended the time of payment of the balance due on the note for one year, with the understanding that the sureties should agree to it.</p>
    <p id="b256-5" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[289,1044,1301,538]]]'>Plaintiff testified, that he afterwards saw Jackson, who requested him to extend the time, as Fountain was hard pressed, and that he could pay out if his creditors would be easy with him. Nothing was done until in July, 1885, when plaintiff again demanded payment of the note. Plaintiff never heard that the sureties objected to the extension of time on the note until suit was brought, and at no time unqualifiedly agreed to extend the time, but at every extension agreed to do so if it was agreeable to the sureties, and reserved the right to proceed on the note if the sureties demanded that suit should be brought. Plaintiff did not see the sureties, except Jackson, as Stated, or ascertain from them whether they consented to the extension of time. He says he thought that was their business.</p>
    <p id="b256-6" data-blocks='[["BL_256.6",256,[290,1594,1299,228]]]'>Sureties Jackson and Dunman both testified that they knew nothing of the extension of time on the note until a short time before suit. Dunman thought it was paid, and neither of them ever consented to the extension or authorized it. Neither of the sureties ever demanded that Brown enter suit on the note.</p>

He admitted on cross-examination that the amount he paid for the extension was according to his original agreement with Brown, and says it was extended because he paid the back interest. He also says that the rate of interest was not increased because of the extension. He also admitted that he had in former depositions testified that Brown said he would grant the extension if he would pay the 3 per cent, and it would be agreeable to all the parties.</p>

The agreement or understanding could not affect the sureties; they were not parties to it; they were bound only by the terms of the note and not by a separate understanding of Brown and Fountain. Such an agreement was usurious and illegal, and could not have legal effect as a promise if Fountain had resisted it; it could certainly as a promise have no effect upon the sureties. Such interest was illegal and could not become an obligation; it was not a legal obligation when paid, and only served when paid as a valuable consideration for the forbearance alleged. The payment of the amount as usurious interest was the same as if it had been paid independently of any original agreement, or any agreement except that of the indulgence. The parties to it at the time of payment made it the consideration of the extension of payment, and it would have that effect, just the. same as the payment of any other amount not due, as for example, the payment of legal interest before it fell due. Both of these questions were decided on the former appeal of this case. Mann v. Brown, 71 Texas, 244, and authorities cited.</p>

The obligation of the note was changed as to time of maturity, first for one year and again for another year, without the consent of the sureties. The condition, that they were to approve it, had no purpose or meaning in the face of the fact that the extension was granted anyhow. Plaintiff acted without consulting them, accepted the consideration, and granted the time, which elapsed without their consent. It was his duty to see that they consented to the agreement before he made it and allowed the time to run in pursuance thereof, and not “ their business,” as he thought.
