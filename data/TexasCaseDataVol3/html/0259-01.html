The petition begins, “ The plaintiffs, August Heintze, R. Aschen, and H. W. Speckles, complaining of the Western Union Telegraph Company, say that the plaintiffs are a copartnership doing business at La Grange, Texas, in the firm name of <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>August Heintze &amp; Co.’ ’ It having been shown that appellee had avowed and published himself as a partner in the firm, in one of the ways that the law would hold him as a partner, then it was not necessary to show that he expressly authorized said declarations or acts. This authority in law will be presumed from his antecedent acts and declarations. When the partnership or agency is once established, the declaration of any authorized agent within the scope of his authority is admissible. Pars, on Part., 140.</p>

It was alleged by appellants, that the firm of August Heintze <em>&amp; </em>Co. was composed, when the debt was contracted, of August Heintze, H. W. Speckles, and R. Aschen, Sr. Heintze and Aschen made default, but H. W. Speckles filed an answer under oath, denying the partnership, and denying that he was ever a member of such partnership. Upon this issue the case was tried, and after the evidence was closed the court directed a verdict for defendant Speckles, which was returned, and judgment was rendered for plaintiffs for the amount óf the account against Heintze and Aschen, and in favor of Speckles.</p>

There was error in the refusal of the court to allow the plaintiffs’ counsel to show to Heintze, while testifying as a witness, and denying that Speckles was a partner, written statements, previously made by the witness, naming Speckles as a member of the firm; and to ask him if such statements were true or false, and to examine him fully concerning the conflict between those statements and his testimony given on the stand. Though the plaintiffs introduced the witness, his relations to Speckles and the other circumstances of the case, considering the difference between Ms evidence and previous statements, was such as to make it proper for the court to allow plaintiffs to interrogate him fully on the subject, and to call for such explanation of his previous statements as he might be able to give. Of course Ms statements made before the trial were not evi<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>deuce against Speckles, but plaintiffs had the right to use them in the examination of the witness.</p>
