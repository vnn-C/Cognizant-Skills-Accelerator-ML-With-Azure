He returned to Austin, and was idle until on January 18, 1890, when he was employed by the defendants, receivers of the International &amp; Great Northern Railway, as a switchman; employed by P. W. Powell, defendants’ yard master at Austin, who was authorized to employ and discharge men, and went to work as a switchman on that evening, between 6 and 7 o’clock.</p>

He had no special knowledge of the use of the coupling apparatus, or the duties of a switchman, except the signals, which at night were given with a lantern; had seen a coupling stick, or coupling knife, and heard it was used to make a coupling without touching the link with the hand, but had never seen it used and did not know how it was used.</p>

Powell, who emplojmd him, knew he had had no experience as a switchman, and at the time of employment did not notify or warn him of the dangers incident to such employment, or of a “ stuck link. ’ ’ Powell knew that he had been employed as before stated as a fireman; that he had recently been on a farm, and had never served as a switchman (a part of whose duties was to couple and uncouple cars). Powell did not notify him of the dangers encountered by a switchman. Had plaintiff known what a stuck link was at the time he was hurt, he would not have attempted to raise the link. He had never seen switchmen use any coupling knife or outfit; had seen them use only their hands and a lantern at night—the lantern to signal with. He was told by Powell that his outfit would be there next day—a lantern, a switch key, and a coupling knife, ordered from San Antonio; and Powell told him to borrow a lantern to use the first night, there being an extra lantern.</p>

These facts, if true, imposed the duty upon them to warn him of the danger to be encountered by him, and their failure to do so, together with the insufficiency of the light furnished, causing the injury, created a liability for injuries resulting therefrom.</p>

This we think was sufficient, in view of the very technical inaccuracy complained of.

He also testified, and we so find, that he did not know the use of it, had never seen it used, and had never seen switchmen use anything at night but a lantern. He went to work by direction of defendants’ agent, voluntarily, it is true—that is, he did not refuse to work without the coupling outfit; but it does not appear that he was culpable in this. He was not advised that it was dangerous to couple cars without it.</p>
