Defendant was ready and willing to transport the goods to the City of Mexico, according to the terms of the contracts of shipment. • The Mexican Central Railway was defendant’s connecting line, and would have carried the goods on to the City of Mexico if desired, after they had passed through the hands of the consignees at El Paso, and passed through the Mexican custom house in Paso del Norte by the consignee, who should have paid the duty.</p>

    <p id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.5",403,[184,871,1300,835]]]'>We think the amount due and to be paid as freight charges on the shipment from Chicago to El Paso was shown by the bills of lading within the meaning of the statute. The contract, as expressed in the bills of lading, was stated to be “ subject to the published tariff of said company and its connections.” The final destination of the goods was the only part of the contract that was changed, and this was done by both the parties, and it was the custom to do so for shippers at El Paso, the company directing that the local rate to El Paso should be paid before the goods should be delivered there. This was the published rate provided for in the bill of lading—the local rate to that point as the final destination. The change in the destination of the goods changed the meaning of the terms—the published rates—but did not change the terms themselves. By consent the haul became a local haul from Chicago to El Paso, and according to the contract the published rate for such local haul would be the freight charge. Defendant insisted that this was the amount to be. paid, and required its agent to demand such amount before delivering the freight.</p>
    <p id="b403-6" data-blocks='[["BL_403.6",403,[186,1718,1299,534]]]'>The amount of freight charge to be paid as shown by the bill of lading was tendered and delivery refused, as found by the court. The fact that the tender by plaintiffs was made under protest did not affect it; it could not be refused on that ground. It seems plaintiffs were contending that they should only pay the proportionate rate of freight to El Paso on a contract of through shipment to the City of Mexico, and protested against paying the local rate to El Paso, but did tender and finally pay the published local rate to El Paso as demanded by the company, but did so under protest. The protest did not invalidate the tender; it being for the amount due and demanded, it was absolute. 1 Benj. on Sales, sec. 1076; 2 Whart. on Con., sec. 974.</p>
