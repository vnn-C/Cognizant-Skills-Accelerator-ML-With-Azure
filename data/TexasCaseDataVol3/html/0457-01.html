The court will not presume the death of the parents from the facts in evidence.</p>

Cloud, deceased, who was killed at the Alamo, March 6, 1836. Their relationship to him as nephews and nieces is shown by the testimony, and it is also shown that he had never been married. It was not shown, however, whether his father and mother were living or dead when the case was tried in the court below.</p>

If they are not living, that fact can be easily shown; and such being the case, parties basing rights upon the theory of their death ought not to ask the courts to infer that fact from circumstances, unless the inference be one which irresistibly follows proof of the circumstances.</p>
