Evidence of the value of the grass as hay, as well as for pasturage purposes, should be admitted for the consideration of the jury, and from a showing of all the purposes for which plaintiff’s grass was useful and valuable, the jury should determine what its value was at the time at which and state in which it stood when burned.</p>
