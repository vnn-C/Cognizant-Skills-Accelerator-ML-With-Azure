If the failure to receive orders for the movement of the train, on which were shipped a number of horses injured by delay in the shipment, is caused by atmospheric or other influences beyond the carrier’s control, rendering unavailable the telegraph wires, such delay would be excused. If the delay was induced by causes beyond the carrier’s control, it is excused, regardless of the <em>agency </em>producing such failure or delay.</p>

Material Issue.—There being testimony tending to show that the delay complained of in the shipment of the horses was caused by atmospheric influences, it was error to refuse to charge the jury upon such issue. To render such delay excusable the carrier must have exercised due care to protect the property against injury pending the delay.</p>

    <p id="b46-13" data-blocks='[["BL_46.14",46,[271,1547,1299,131]]]'>The petition charges, among other grounds for recovery, that there was unreasonable delay on the part of appellant in the transportation of the horses.</p>
    <p id="b46-14" data-blocks='[["BL_46.15",46,[270,1697,1299,337]]]'>The testimony shows that the principal delay occurred at Waverly, Louisiana. Appellant pleaded, and there was testimony tending to show, that said delay was caused by atmospheric influences on the telegraph wires, beyond appellant’s control, rendering it impossible for its train master to communicate with its employes at Waverly in charge of the train upon which the horses were loaded. The testimony of the witness Bond tended to support this theory.</p>
    <p id="b46-15" data-blocks='[["BL_46.16",46,[269,2046,1301,289]]]'>While the court, in general terms, instructed the jury in reference to acts of God and inevitable accidents, it did not affirmatively submit to the jury the question presented by that part of appellant’s answer seeking to excuse the delay because of its inability to communicate with and direct its employes in charge of the train; and appellant asked the court to give the following special instruction, which was refused:</p>

    <p id="b47-7" data-blocks='[["BL_47.7",47,[199,1130,1306,535]]]'>While the rule is, that a common carrier is an insurer of property when received for shipment, and will not be excused for its nondelivery unless-it be shown that its loss was occasioned by an act of God or the public-enemy, or resulted from inherent vice in the property, the rule is different when the property is transported and delivered, and it is sought to-hold the carrier liable for injury resulting from delay. Where the property is actually transported and delivered, but the time of delivery was delayed, such delay, if resulting from causes beyond the control of the carrier, may be excused. If under such circumstances the carrier exercises due care for the protection and preservation of the property, he will not be liable. Railway v. Levi, 76 Texas, 337.</p>
    <p id="b47-8" data-blocks='[["BL_47.8",47,[200,1677,1303,783]]]'>It is a matter of common knowledge, that the telegraph is an important factor in railway business. Through its instrumentality the movements of many trains are directed by one person; and it can readily be understood, that when a train reaches a station at which it is to receive orders to govern its further movements, if such orders are not received, it might be gross negligence for the train to proceed on its journey and incur the obvious risk of collision with another train. Delay under such circumstances might be absolutely necessary for the protection of human life; and if the failure to receive orders for the movement of the train is caused by atmospheric or other influences beyond the carrier’s control, rendering unavailable the telegraph wires, such delay would be excused upon the same principle that excuses delay beyond the control of the carrier when caused by strikes or mobs, as announced in the case just cited. And it is immaterial whether such unavoidable failure of the telegraph wires be attributed to the act of God or not. If beyond the carrier’s control, it excuses, regardless of the agency producing such failure.</p>
