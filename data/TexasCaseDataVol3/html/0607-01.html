At the time of this purchase Smith had no actual knowledge of the institution of this suit, and had the money ready and desired to pay the note and one year’s interest, and wrote to Dan T.

I was at that time cashier of the First National Bank of Brownwood, and Vaughn did his banking business with me.”</p>

After the maturity of the note, and before the institution of this-suit, the plaintiff had a letter written to Vaughn, addressed to Brown-wood, Texas, which the testimony indicates he received, asking if he-wanted the note sent to Brownwood for payment. To this letter no reply was received.</p>
    <p id="b636-10" data-blocks='[["BL_636.8",636,[312,1360,1305,639]]]'>Opinion.—Appellant instituted this suit against appellee J. L. Vaughn, and sought a recovery upon a promissory note, and a foreclosure of a-vendor’s lien on 1280 acres of land, in part payment for which the note was executed. After the institution of the suit, Vaughn sold the land toappellee Brooke Smith, who agreed with Vaughn to pay the note now in suit. The note stipulated for 8 per cent interest from date, and 10 per cent attorney fee if sued on after maturity. The case was tried two years-after maturity of the note, and a verdict and judgment rendered for appellant for the principal of the note and one year’s interest; and the costs were taxed against him. From this judgment appellant has appealed, and contends, that according to the uncontroverted facts disclosed by the record, he is entitled to judgment for the principal of said note, interest thereon at 8 per cent per annum from date, and 10 per cent attorney fee.</p>
    <p id="b636-11" data-blocks='[["BL_636.9",636,[309,2010,1305,532]],["BL_637.1",637,[152,364,1305,584]]]'>This contention must be sustained. The note sued on, signed by appellee Vaughn, and which appellee Smith agreed to pay, fixes their liability. By its terms they are required to pay interest from date to the-time of payment of the principal, and 10 per cent attorney fee if sued on after maturity. This note is not made payable at any particular bank, office, or other place in Brownwood. It is a negotiable instrument, and Vaughn executed it, knowing that it might legitimately pass into the-hands of a third person; and as against such person (or the original holder) the payment of the full amount of interest and attorney fee can not be avoided, unless a tender, or the equivalent of a tender, is shown. This was not done. It is true that the note was not in Brownwood when <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>it fell due, and therefore no actual tender could have been made at that-place. If the evidence had gone further, and shown that Vaughn had a residence or place of business or agent in Brownwood known to appellant, and had the money there and desired to tender payment of the note and interest at maturity, and that the residence of the payee was unknown to Vaughn, the case might be different. But it was not shown with any certainty that he had money to pay it; and there is an entire absence of any evidence tending to show that he desired to pay it. Appellee Smith testified, that Vaughn did his banking with his bank, and if the note had been presented for payment in Brownwood at maturity, it would have been promptly paid. If this was sufficient evidence of ability on Vaughn’s part to pay the note, it was no proof of a desire to do so.</p>
