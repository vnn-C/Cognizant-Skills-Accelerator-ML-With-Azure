Jurisdiction of County Court — Amendment to Confer. —Appellees sued in the County Court on a note for $2500, upon which had been paid $1561.42, but the ten per cent attorney fee stipulated for in the note made the amount in excess of $1000. Defendants having filed demurrer and plea to the jurisdiction of the court, plaintiffs by amendment remitted all of the amount sued for as principal and attorney fees in excess of $1000. The real cause of action could not be thus reduced without the consent of the defendants, so as to bring the amount in controversy within the jurisdiction of the County Court, and the case is reversed and dismissed.</p>

It was not permissible to abandon a part of that demand and recover the remainder.

      <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>It may be true that the claim for the attorney fee was so distinct from the debt that the plaintiffs might have wholly abandoned it, and have thus obtained a standing in court upon a cause of action which the court had power to adjudicate. But this was not done. The effort was to abandon a part of that demand and recover the remainder. Upon principle, it would seem that this was not permissible. The cause of action upon the note was entire, and was a liquidated demand, as was the stipulated fee. What court had the power to hear and adjudicate it was determined by law. The right to have the cause passed upon in that forum belonged to defendants as well as to the plaintiffs, and the arbitrary action of neither could deprive the other of its enjoyment.</p>
    <p id="b523-4" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[179,875,1299,528]]]'>There are authorities which hold, that a creditor may enter a fictitious credit on his claim in order to bring it within the jurisdiction of an inferior tribunal; but none of them, so far as we have examined, have given reasons which are satisfactory. It is generally assumed that the indebtedness exists as claimed, and that the debtor has no interest in objecting to a reduction of it, and therefore no right to complain of the attempt thus to confer jurisdiction. But this is a begging of the question. The very thing to be adjudicated is the question whether or not there is an indebtedness, and this question both parties are entitled to have determined by the tribunal to which the law has given jurisdiction over the cause of action.</p>
    <p id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.5",523,[177,1424,1299,585]]]'>In cases of liquidated demands which constitute entire causes of action, we can discover no sound principle which would clothe the plaintiff with such a power as is claimed. When unliquidated damages are sued for, there is no way in which the amount of the subject matter in controversy is to be determined in advance of a trial, except by the allegations made by the plaintiff, and this of necessity puts it in his power to determine the question of jurisdiction. Even here, however, he will not be permitted to practice a fraud on jurisdiction, if the issue be properly made. When the amount to which the plaintiff appears, from his allegations, to be entitled is a fixed sum, and is beyond that which the law has empowered the court to adjudicate, the plaintiff should not be permitted to enter a fictitious credit for the avowed purpose of giving jurisdiction.</p>

We would not be understood as disturbing or questioning the conclusions-thus reached. In such cases the court is not without jurisdiction over the subject matter, in such sense as to render its judgment void for the-amount sued for and adjudged not exceeding the limit of the jurisdiction fixed by law; all question as to whether the cause of action was as alleged is concluded by the judgment. But when the objection is made in the-original suit, by the defendant asserting his right to have his cause heard in the proper forum, and when it appears that a cause of action for a fixed and liquidated sum has been reduced in order to confer jurisdiction,, the right of the defendant to have his cause tried in the forum established by law should be respected. Here, on the face of the pleadings, it confessedly appears, that after the defendants had entered their exceptions and plea to the jurisdiction, the plaintiffs, for no reason but to reduce their cause of action so as to meet the objection, undertook to divide a demand which was an entirety.
