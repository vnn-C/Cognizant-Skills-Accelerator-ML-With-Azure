Interference in such instance by either habeas corpus or injunction is not an exercise by the judge of a power properly attached to the executive department. To prevent the assumption of authority which under the law does not exist, is not usurpation of such authority.</p>

Apparently legal steps looking to the change are taken. The question comes before the Commissioner. He will probably so act ■as to effectuate the change. The wronged county appeals to the courts to restrain the Commissioner from acting, because if he acts it will be without real and only by virtue of colorable authority; the real authority having been once exercised, being only once exercisable, and therefore exhausted, and yet the courts will not respond to prayer to prevent the injury.

The powers of the Government are divided into separate departments, and must be kept distinct. That the judiciary can not exercise any power confided to the executive. Second. The District Courts have power to issue the writs of mandamus and injunction, and the power is-general within the proper sphere of the Judicial Department, but can not extend to any power properly attached to the Executive Department, The judiciary is not expressly permitted by the Constitution to exercise-any power over the Executive Department, and therefore by the plain terms of the instrument itself is prohibited from doing so.</p>

But they have no jurisdiction, either original or appellate, in matters confided entirely to the Executive Department.

The Commissioner of the General Land Office is authorized and required by law to determine all questions pertaining to county boundaries. He alone has such authority. He is the legal tribunal of last resort in such matters. He must determine for himself when his powers are invoked, must determine when he is called upon to act, and must judge for himself, under the law, of the extent of his powers and jurisdiction in each case presented; and in the exercise of his official judgment he is not subject to the control of any other department. No other official or department can decide when his jurisdiction is called into action, or the manner of its exercise. We want to be fully understood here. County Courts appoint surveyors to ascertain the locality of a boundary line between their respective counties. The surveyors disagree, and certify such disagreement to the Commissioner of the General Land Office. This is an appeal to that officer. Under the law he must decide the question. He alone can act. Can the courts decide for him, whether or not he shall act or how he shall act ? Can they determine when his power is invoked ? Can they determine when his jurisdiction is called into action any more than they can direct how his power shall be exercised in this matter which clearly requires the exercise of judgment on questions of law and fact ? If so, where do the courts get this power ?

Not from the Constitution, because that instrument expressly prohibits the assumption of such power. Is the judiciary endowed with more wisdom than the Executive Department ? Is there some mysterious, undefined, and indefinable authority supposed to exist in the judiciary that enables it to rise above the power which gave it existence ? Is this a government of law? Does the Constitution mean anything when it places a limit on the powers of each department of government, and says to them, “so far shall you go, and no further <em>?” </em>Can the courts go contrary to law, and override precedent to remedy a supposed wrong ? Certainly not; and yet that is just what the court is asked to do by plaintiff in error in this case. Those who contend for such power in the courts as here contended for fail to keep in view the division of the powers of government and the necessity for keeping such powers distinct. They insist that for every wrong there is a remedy, yet they fail to realize the fact that an illegal remedy would be infinitely worse than the evil sought to be corrected.</p>

    <p id="b696-8" data-blocks='[["BL_696.8",696,[282,1069,1303,289]]]'>It is contended in behalf of the plaintiff in error, that if the.

    <p id="b696-9" data-blocks='[["BL_696.9",696,[283,1370,1302,436]]]'>There is much force in this contention, but it is not deemed necessary to pass upon the constitutionality of this statute, because in our opinion it has no application to the facts of this case. This law does not, in terms- or by implication, prohibit the issuance of writs of injunction against the officers of the Executive Departments of the State in all cases; but the inhibition is, by the very words of the statute, limited ■ to such writs and process as are issued “ to order or compel any act or duty, which by the laws of the State they or either of them are authorized to perform, whether such act or duty be judicial, ministerial or discretionary.”</p>

If the plaintiff was conceding the power of the Commissioner of the General Land Office to act in the matter, and asking the court to compel him to act in a particular manner, the statute referred to would have application, and it would be necessary to determine its validity. But such is not the case. The petition virtually admits that if authority exists for the performance of the acts the plaintiff has no case.</p>

This same section also declares, that these tribunals shall have jurisdiction “ of all suits, complaints, or pleas whatever, without regard to any distinction betwegn law and equity, when the matter in controversy shall be valued at or amount to five hundred dollars, exclusive of interest;” and that they “shall have general original jurisdiction over all causes of action whatever for which a remedy or jurisdiction is not provided by law or this Constitution, and such other jurisdiction, original and appellate, as may be provided by law.”</p>

International Railway Company, 40 Texas, 537, and Kuechler v. Wright, same volume, page 600, widely divergent views have heretofore prevailed ■among the members of our Supreme Court as to the meaning and effect ■of section 1, article 2, and section 1, article 4, of the Constitution, as above quoted; and although a majority of the court held in Railway v. Gross, 47 Texas, 428, that the District Court had no jurisdiction, by mandamus or otherwise, to control the Commissioner of the General Land Office in the issuance of land certificates, it can hardly be said, that the law is clearly settled by that court, that writs of mandamus will not lie against the heads of the Executive Department to compel the performance of purely ministerial duties. In fact, it appears to have been the opinion of Judge Gould, in the case last cited, that such a writ would issue to compel the issuance of a patent to land; and as shown by his able opinion in Kuechler v. Wright, supra, Judge Moore, another member of the court, was of the opinion, that the heads of the Executive Department could be compelled by mandamus to perform any purely minis<a id="p673" href="#p673" data-label="673" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*673</a>terial duty. But even if the law be regarded as settled against the power of District Courts to issue writs of mandamus against the heads of the Executive Department, in our opinion, this does not determine the question of authority to issue writs of injunction. There is a vast difference between coercing or restraining an officer in a matter within the scope of his authority, and exercising similar control over him in a matter clearly outside of and beyond his authority. The authority of District Courts to issue writs of habeas corpus is conferred by the same clause of the Constitution that authorizes them to issue writs of injunction; and the one, in so far as the question of jurisdiction is concerned, occupies no higher plane than the other. Could it be successfully contended, therefore, that an application for a writ of habeas corpus, which otherwise would be promptly granted, must be refused by a district judge if it disclosed the fact that the restraint complained of was imposed by the head of one of the Executive Departments of the Government ? Assuredly not. If such a construction of the Constitution should obtain, a citizen might be unlawfully imprisoned for years by the chief officer of one of the Executive Departments, acting under pretended authority of his office, and the courts would be powerless, though appealed to daily, to afford relief. Such a construction can not be sound.</p>
