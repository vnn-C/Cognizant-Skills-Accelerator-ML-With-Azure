A city ordinance made it unlawful for horses to run at large within the corporate limits. <em>Held, </em>that the court erred in submitting to the jury the question whether appellant was guilty of negligence in having its fence on the street. If appellant had no right to have its fence there, appellee had no right to have his horse at large, and if confined it would not have been injured, and there is no evidence that the fence being on the street helped to cause the injury.</p>
