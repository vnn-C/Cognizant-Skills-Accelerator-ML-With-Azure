On September 5, 1890, the children and heirs of the wife of Stephens conveyed to appellant. The verdict of the jury establishes the amount paid by appellant to the State to procure the patent to be $277.15, and for taxes 86.50, making a total of $283.65. The judgment of the court below is in favor of appellees for one-half the land, subject to appellant’s interest in the mineral therein, and requiring them to pay one-half the $283.65 paid by appellant as aforesaid; from which judgment this appeal is prosecuted.</p>

      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.—We are of opinion that-the instrument executed by Benjamin Stephens to appellees, November 10,1885, upon its face was a mortgage upon the land in controversy, with power of sale in the manner therein set forth, and that the action of the court in admitting oral evidence to make this clearer could not be material, even if error. Stephens’ wife being dead at the time of the execution of this instrument, he had the right to mortgage his interest in his homestead, whether the debt was due for improvements or not. Lacy v.

No propositions are submitted under this assignment, nor is any statement made thereunder in the brief of appellant to show <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>what paroi evidence was admitted as to the notices of the sale complained -of. What we have already said shows that we think no material error was committed in admitting paroi evidence to show that the instrument complained of was a trust deed, and we are of opinion that we should not consider the second proposition contained in the assignment. Where an assignment of error raises more than one distinct proposition, it is not permissible under the rules to treat the assignment itself as a proposition raising all the questions suggested therein. In such cases these questions must be submitted as distinct propositions in the brief, accompanied with appropriate statements to sustain the same from the record. See Rules of Supreme Court, 29-32.</p>
    <p id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.5",357,[156,875,1301,386]]]'>If there is any evidence in the record at all which would have justified the submission of the issue of fraud in obtaining the mortgage, or attacking the sale thereunder, we think it is so meager that the action of the court in ignoring these issues in submitting the case to the jury, if error at all, would be an error of omission and not of commission, and could only be taken advantage of by appellant by asking correct instructions in the court below, and we think the court did not err in refusing those requested by him. These requested charges were as follows:</p>
    <p id="b357-6" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[158,1274,1299,186]]]'>“ That you will determine from the evidence whether the deed of trust was executed by Ben Stephens with the full understanding of its contents as a mechanic’s lien; if so, then it could not be foreclosed or sold without a suit brought to foreclose in the courts.”</p>

    <p id="b357-8" data-blocks='[["BL_357.8",357,[155,1670,1302,327]]]'>We think these charges entirely too general in their terms, and leave too much to the discretion of the jury in deciding as to what would constitute fairness in the sale, and as to what would. constitute such fraud as would render the mortgage invalid. We also fail to find in the record any evidence which would have been sufficient to sustain a verdict of the jury setting aside the mortgage on the ground of fraud in its procurement.</p>
    <p id="b357-9" data-blocks='[["BL_357.9",357,[157,2019,1301,334]]]'>In the sixth assignment appellant presents the proposition, that the power to sell under the mortgage arose on the 1st of November, 1886, and was functus officio on the 3rd of April, 1888, and a sale made at that time was therefore void. The mortgage stipulates that if the debt is not paid when due, <em>“ </em>then the said Carson <em>&amp; </em>Lewis, <em>at any time thereafter, </em>may take possession and sell,” etc. We therefore think the sale was not void upon the ground presented in the assignment.</p>

We are of opinion that the disposition made by the court in the judgment of the matters in controversy was correct according to the verdict as rendered, and that no material error was committed to the prejudice of appellant in failing to copy the verdict accurately in the judgment; We think the verdict as rendered was in favor of plaintiff for one-half the land, not for $160 in money, as contended by appellant.</p>
