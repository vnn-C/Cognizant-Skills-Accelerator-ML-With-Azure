    <p id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[279,469,1300,1084]]]'>“ Sometime in January or February, A. D. 1890, the defendant, Keith, applied to me to know if there was any vacant land which he could locate as a homestead. I told him I was not certain of any; that there were places where there might be and probably was some vacant land, but it would take a survey to determine; that I knew of one such a place, and would go and survey it for him for the legal fees, $3 per mile, but he would have to take the chances of there being any vacant land there. He said he was too poor to pay the fees and take any chances; that he wanted to be certain before he paid'anything; that he had rather pay more and be sure of getting some land than to pay fees and then perhaps not get any; finally we made the written contract in evidence. I found and surveyed a tract of 120 acres of vacant land for the defendant to locate upon, but the defendant refused to locate upon it and make the affidavit required to make an application for the land as a homestead, so that I could not make the papers for the General Land Office which the contract required. I did everything that I could do until the defendant made his affidavit and application. I was ready and willing to make the field notes of the survey for the Land Office, and complete my part of the contract when defendant made the affidavit, but his failure to make the affidavit prevented my fully performing the contract on my part. The defendant has never delivered the mules specified in the contract; they are worth about $35 or $40 apiece.”</p>
