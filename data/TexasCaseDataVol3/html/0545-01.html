This action is founded upon section 39, page,32, of the General Laws of 1892, permitting the amendment of appeal bonds. As this case had been transferred to this court by our Supreme Court, we deemed it proper to certify to the latter the question for decision, whether,, by the act referred to, we were empowered to grant the relief sought.</p>
