Same—Case in Judgment.—The Missouri Pacific Railway Company, while operating the International <em>&amp; </em>Great Northern Railway, contracted to carry certain cattle from Pearsall, on the line of the International &amp; Great Northern Railway, to Chicago. Injury to the cattle was alleged to have been caused at Denison, Texas, on the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway. Suit against the International &amp; Great Northern Railway Company for damages. <em>Held, </em>that the clause in the shipping contract, that in case the cattle are to be shipped over other roads than the Missouri Pacific Railway, the latter should be released from all liability after they shall have left its road, protected the International &amp; Great Northern Railway Company against loss, regardless of its being the lessor of the line of road upon which the cattle were first shipped. The loss happened after the freight had left the line of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company. It would be inequitable to impose the burdens of the freight contract upon the lessor company and not give the benefit of its restrictions.</p>

It is further set up, that the road of defendant only extends to Taylor, a point between Pearsall and Denison, Texas, and that the injury to the cattle occurred beyond its line, wherefore, by the terms of the twelfth section of the contract, it was not liable.</p>
