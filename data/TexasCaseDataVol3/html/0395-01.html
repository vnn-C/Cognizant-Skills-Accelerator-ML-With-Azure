It does not purport to convey Newton’s interest in the original survey, nor an undivided interest of 320 or any other number of acres therein; but attempts to convey his “ right, title, and interest” in an undesignated and undescribed 320 acres.</p>

If the original survey contained only 320 acres, then it might be held that the intention was to convey all Newton’s interest in the survey. But, considering all the facts disclosed by the record, and the description given in the deed under consideration, it does not appear with reasonable certainty what particular 320 acres of the survey he intended to convey his interest in.
