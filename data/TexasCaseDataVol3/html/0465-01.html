Edwards and Wilkey, of Kaufman County, Texas, by their deed of that date, a certain tract, piece, or parcel of land lying and being situated in said Kaufman County, and being 224.4 acres, out of the David Harris league and labor, and particularly described by metes and bounds in said deed, to which said deed reference is here made for particular description and identification of said 224.4 acres.

      <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>At the time said instrument was executed, appellants Edwards and! Wilkie were in possession of the 13 acres of land referred to, claiming it as part of a tract of land they had purchased from another party on a-survey adjoining the Harris survey, on which the land sold to them by the Hefleys is situated. This instrument recites the fact that there is a-supposed conflict of 13 acres between the land conveyed by the Hefleys to Edwards and Wilkie and’ a tract of land already owned by Edwards- and Wilkie, and obligates said Edwards and Wilkie and their sureties to pay said G. W. and E. A. Hefley $8 per acre for said 13 acres of land whenever said Hefleys “maintain their title and possession to said 13 acres of land and place the said Edwards and Wilkie in the lawful, peaceable, undisturbed, and adverse possession thereof under superior title.”'</p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.5",493,[206,928,1301,278]]]'>Such being the case, we think it was contemplated by the parties to the obligation that the purchase money for the 13 acres was not to be paid until G. W. and E. A. Hefley, in a tribunal having jurisdiction to-determine the question of title arising out of the alleged conflict between, the two surveys, should obtain a judgment establishing the superiority of their title.</p>
    <p id="b493-6" data-blocks='[["BL_493.6",493,[205,1227,1312,433]]]'>Edwards and Wilkie were in possession of the 13 acres at the time the obligation was executed; and because they have remained in possession since then, it can not be fairly said that they have been placed in possession by the Hefleys. Being in possession when they signed the instrument sued on, it is evident that it was contemplated by the parties to the-instrument that they should remain in possession under their former-claim without paying the Hefleys for the land until they, by a proper-proceeding in the District Court, should establish the fact that their title was superior to the title under which Edwards and Wilkie held the land.</p>
    <p id="b493-7" data-blocks='[["BL_493.7",493,[204,1673,1313,725]]]'>No such adjudication was shown on the trial of this case. It is true that County and Justice Courts are not deprived of authority to try cases otherwise within their jurisdiction merely because the title to land may be inch - den tally involved. In such cases, it is usually held that possession insufficient evidence of title. But when the gist of a cause of actionr whether in form of trespass to try title or in any other form, rests upon-1 the proposition that the title to land asserted by the plaintiff is superior" to that of the defendant, the District Court alone has jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter. Cronn v. Peterson, 1 W. &amp; W. C. C.,sec. 1061; Carter Lumber Co. v. Antonio de Grazier, 3 Willson’s C. C., sec. 177; Scripture v. Kent, 1 W. <em>&amp; </em>W. C. C., secs. 1056, 1057. The County Court could, not adjudicate the question of title as involved in this case. If a District Court judgment had been produced showing an adjudication of title in-favor of the Hefleys, the County Court could have rendered judgment on. the bond.</p>
