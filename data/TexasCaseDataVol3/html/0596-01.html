But the rule is, when a court of general jurisdiction assumes to act within the limits of its ordinary powers, all presumptions will be indulged in support of the legality of <em>its </em>action, and not against it.</p>

The administration is held valid. That none Were paid does not negative their existence.</p>

The County Court of San Patricio County, being <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>a court of general jurisdiction in matters pertaining to the estates of decedents, its proceedings in reference to the estate of Edward Ryan, he being a citizen of that county, can not be questioned in a collateral attack, as is attempted by plaintiffs in error, they being strangers and having no interest in his estate. The burden is upon them to show that no facts existed which could have authorized the court to appoint an administrator. And we submit that the transcript offered in evidence does not affirmatively show that the court had no jurisdiction over the estate; and that the mere fact that there does not appear in the papers and proceedings copied that any debts against the estate were ever presented, is not sufficient, after the lapse of forty years, to discharge the burden resting upon them. We further submit, that after the lapse of so great a time as forty years, it appearing that one of the heirs was administrator, and that at the close of the administration a partition was had, in which the other heir participated and received her part of the estate, it must be held that the County Court of San Patricio County had jurisdiction, and that its orders and decrees are conclusive.

    <p id="b624-5" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[268,1341,1302,986]]]'>2. The question of true location of the north line of the James Smith league was a question of fact, to be decided by the jury, under proper instructions by the court as to the general rules of law applicable to questions of disputed boundary. The controlling question in determining the boundaries of a survey is, Where did the original surveyor actually run the lines on the ground ? And if all the lines were not run, where did the surveyor intend the line should be ? In submitting these questions, the court gave in charge all the rules applicable, viz., calls for natural objects, such as rivers, creeks, etc., control calls for artificial objects; these in turn control course and distance, and course controls distance. But all these rules are mere guides in determining where the lines were actually run or intended, and are to be disregarded if the jury are satisfied that the true location can be better ascertained by the testimony of living witnesses, who were present when the land was originally located, or from other circumstantial and admissible testimony of the main fact. We believe that the foregoing is a correct statement of the law of disputed boundaries; and the court having submitted the same fully to the jury, and there being abundant evidence to support their finding, we submit that, presenting a question of fact passed upon by the jury, under proper instructions from the court, this proposition can not be sustained.</p>

The east and west boundaries of this survey are each 10,000 varas long, and its north and south boundaries are each 2500 varas in length. The true northeast corner of this survey is the main question to be determined, on which depends the location of its north boundary line. None of the corners of the survey are marked on the ground.

It does not appear that they make any question as to the sufficiency of any of the deeds in the chain of title of intervenors, except as to the conveyance to James O’Neal from John Ryan, as administrator of the estate of Edward Ryan. On the trial the entire chain of title of intervenors, as pleaded by them, was put in evidence; and in connection with the deed from said administrator to James O’Neal a transcript of all the proceedings in the estate of Edward Ryan that appeared on the probate record of San Patricio County was read in evidence. Plaintiffs in error contend, that it appears upon the face of said transcript that the administration upon the estate of Edward Ryan was unauthorized and void, because it discloses the fact that Ryan owed no debts, and after twelve years had expired from the date of his death, as was shown by said transcript, no administration could be legally opened thereon; and further, they contend, that if administration upon his estate was proper, that the transcript shows such irregularities as render the proceedings void; and they contend, that the probate proceedings being void, the deed of the administrator to O’Neal is void, and that the instruction given was error.</p>

That administration on the estate of John Ryan and on the estate of Edward Ryan was applied for by John and Mathew Ryan in one petition is an irregularity, but not of a character to invalidate' the administration, has been decided in this State. Grande v. Herrera, 15 Texas, 538. Plaintiffs in error contend, that the two estates were administered together, by the same orders and judgments, at least as to part of the orders and judgments. We do not so understand the record. The transcript shows, that separate orders were made appointing John and Mathew Ryan administrators of the two estates, and all the proceedings subsequent thereto, in the two estates, are, so far as the <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>transcript discloses, entirely separate. The failure of the transcript to show bonds executed by John and Mathew Ryan as administrators of the estate of Edward Ryan would not invalidate the sale of the certificate to-James O’Neal. That there were such bonds given will be presumed to uphold said sale. Moody v. Butler, 63 Texas, 212. Besides, the recital found in the transcript relating to the approval of their bonds, considered in the connection in which the recital is found, hardly admits of any other explanation than that the bonds referred to were filed by them 'as-administrators of the estate of Edward Ryan.</p>
    <p id="b630-3" data-blocks='[["BL_630.4",630,[277,780,1301,482]]]'>Again, the record fails to show an application to the court by the administrator to sell the' certificate; but there is a recital in the order of the court directing the sale, to the effect that the administrator had presented such a petition. That such an application, however, should appear in the proceedings is not necessary. Alexander v. Maverick, 18 Texas, 196; Robertson v. Johnson, 57 Texas, 64. Plaintiffs in error further insist, that there being two administrators appointed, one could not legally act in making a sale of the property of the estate; but the evidence is, that Mathew Ryan had died before the sale was made; John Ryan being the survivor, his right to act alone is well settled.</p>
    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[276,1274,1300,785]]]'>Our examination of the irregularities apparent on the face of the probate proceedings, and which are relied on by plaintiffs in error to invalidate the sale of the certificate, satisfies us that they can not have that effect. We believe, that if it were true that John Ryan was not properly appointed administrator of the estate of Edward Ryan, still as he was recognized by the Probate Court of San Patricio County as such administrator, and under its order sold the certificate in question, his authority could not be called in question collaterally for the purpose of invalidating the sale. It has been uniformly held by our Supreme Court, that a purchaser at an administration sale, who has purchased in good faith, and paid the purchase money, will be protected if he shows an order of the court directing the sale, and another confirming the same, or acts of the court amounting to a continuance of the same. These principles are applicable, however, only in cases where the court has jurisdiction over the estate; where the, grounds that confer jurisdiction upon the court to administer the estate actually exist.</p>
    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.6",630,[275,2071,1300,430]]]'>This brings us to consider whether or not the proceedings on the estate of Edward Ryan were void for the want of the existence of the necessary facts to confer jurisdiction upon the court to grant the administration. Plaintiffs ir error contend that the record of the proceedings put in evidence upon its face shows that the estate owed no debts, and that administration was opened on the estate twelve years after the death of the intestate; and that the nonexistence of debts and the great lapse of time within which no administration was sued out are fatal to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
    <p id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.4",631,[143,326,1301,1030]]]'>
      <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>Certainly it does not affirmatively appear on the face of the proceedings that the estate owed no debts when the administration was sued out; and there was no proof made outside the record showing that there were no debts then owing by the estate. It does appear upon the face of said proceedings that no debts were paid during the administration except such, as were by it created; but this does not prove that no other debts existed. We have here before us in this case an administration opened by a court of general jurisdiction in probate matters, and no proof of the nonexistence of the facts that would confer jurisdiction upon the court, unless we resort to inference and presumption; but the rule is, that when a court of general jurisdiction assumes to act within the limits of its ordinary powers, all presumptions will be indulged in support of the legality of its action, and not against it. The attack on the proceedings of the County Court of San Patricio County made in this case is a collateral attack; the rule is familiar, that in such cases, the action of the court must be upheld if facts <em>could exist </em>that would authorize the action taken. The fact that twelve years elapsed after the death of Edward Eyan before administration was opened upon his estate, affords a strong presumption that the debts of the estate, if any ever existed, had been paid; but it is only a presumption, and the jurisdictional fact of debts by the estate <em>could exist </em>in the face of the presumption.</p>
    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[144,1369,1298,731]]]'>There are a number of cases in our reports where administrations were sued out on the estates of persons who died about the period when Edward Eyan died, and in some instances were sued out after the intestate had been dead for quite a number of years. These cases were carefully reviewed in the well considered case of Martin v. Eobinson, 67 Texas, 368, and the judge delivering the opinion, after reviewing them, uses this language: “ None of these cases assert the broad proposition, that an administration will be deemed void on the sole ground that over fourteen years elapsed after the death of the intestate before administration was granted.” In another part of the same opinion the judge says: “ We know of no case in which it has been held under the Act of March 20, 1848, that a grant of administration was void, because made after the lapse of as many years as transpired between the death of James Carter and the grant of administration on his estate.” James Carter died in 1853, and administration was opened on his estate in 1867.</p>

Willis, 69 Texas, 264, cited by plaintiffs in error, it appears there were two attempted administrations, one sued out more than ten years after the death of the intestate, and which is presumed to have been closed, and the other sued out seventeen years after intestate’s death. The court holds both these attempted administrations to be void. The long time that intervened between the death of the intestate and the commencement of the proceedings is stated as one of the grounds to <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>render them void; but it is clear from the argument in the opinion, that there were other grounds that had more controlling weight; that there was no necessity for the administration shown; that it was apparent the proceedings were instituted to consume the estate and misapply it under the semblance of legal authority, and by the aid of the Probate Court; and that the proceedings were instituted in a county where no one interested in the estate would be supposed to be looking after it. These considerations are strohgly urged in the opinion.</p>
    <p id="b632-5" data-blocks='[["BL_632.5",632,[279,709,1301,634]]]'>In the case of Stone Land and Cattle Company v. Boon, 73 Texas, 548, also cited by plaintiffs in error, an administration granted fifteen years after the death of Petreswick, upon his estate, was held void. It. appears that Petreswick was a member of the Georgia Battalion, and fell at Goliad, and that the petition of the applicant for administration on his estate did not show facts that would entitle petitioner, under the Act of January 14, 1841, to administer on said estate; and on this ground alone the grant of administration on Petreswick’s estate was a nullity. This ground was taken by the court in the opinion in the case, but it is further said, that independent of this ground of nullity, the fact that the administration was opened fifteen years after the death of Petreswick, and <em>no necessity for an administration on the estate was shown, </em>would of itself render the grant of administration void.</p>

We think the true doctrine to be deduced from them, and from the case of Martin v. Robinson, supra, is, that in administration proceedings under the Probate Act of 1848, to determine whether or not an administration is void, the courts should look not only to the time that elapsed before it was applied for, but to the entire record of the proceedings, and ascertain therefrom whether or not there was a necessity, or apparent necessity, for the administration; whether or not the application to administer was made in good faith to benefit the estate, by those interested to take care of it, and who were entitled to administer it.</p>

It appears that John Ryan and Mathew Ryan, the administrators, were brother of and Mary Ryan sister of Edward Ryan, and the three constituted his sole heirs. Edward Ryan was entitled to two land certificates at the date of his death, which had never been obtained for his estate; he was also entitled to money demands against the government, the amount of which had not been ascertained at the time administration was granted on his estate. Here there is an apparent reason for the administration, and <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>two out of the three heirs are the applicants for letters; further, the record shows that the proceeds of the estate, after the costs of administration were paid, were divided among those entitled to it as sole heirs of the decedent. The purpose of the administrators in applying for the administration was evidently an honest one, and the proceedings had were satisfactory to those interested in the estate.</p>
