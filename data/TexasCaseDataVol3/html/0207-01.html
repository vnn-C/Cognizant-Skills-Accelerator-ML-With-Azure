All questions of fact are for the jury, and the court acted properly in submitting to the jury the question whether plaintiff as a fact relied on the directions of the conductor, and whether the movement of the train would have appeared dangerous to an ordinarily or reasonably prudent man. They are questions of fact for the jury in determining whether there was as a fact that degree of negligence on part of plaintiff which would constitute what the law terms contributory negligence'under the rule recognized in Railway v. Gorbett, 49 Texas, 573; Railway v. Leslie, 57 Texas, 87, and Railway v. Hassell, 62 Texas, 260.</p>

The appellee’s case is, that he was invited to take a free ride by the conductor of the train, who agreed to put him down at a place other than a regular station. That upon arrival at the place where he intended to leave the train, it did not stop as the conductor agreed it would, but he was told by the conductor that he could get off with safety, and was instructed by the conductor how to jump off, and that there was no danger in so doing. That plaintiff did not know of the danger, but relied upon the statement of the conductor that it was not dangerous to alight. That he exercised due care in alighting from the train, and did so as instructed by the conductor, and in the attempt he was violently hurled to the- ground, and was injured, etc.</p>
