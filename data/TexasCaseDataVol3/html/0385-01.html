Immediately after marriage, we moved into the little ‘ green house ’ located on the lots described in plaintiff’s petition, two and one-half lots. They belonged to my husband, Barron F. Deal, before our marriage. The house was built before our marriage; after our marriage he added a little room for a kitchen and a shed. I have two children by former husband—-two girls, aged 12 and 18 years. Mr. Deal borrowed the money to build the house from the El Paso Building and Loan Association. We lived in the little green house from the time of marriage until his death, in Ma)f, 1885. Shortly after his death I moved out of the same and went and lived in the back part of my millinery store for awhile, and then built a brick house in another part of the city of El Paso, on El Paso Street, and moved into it with my family. The little green house is on Campbell Street. I left it because it was too far from my business. I was in the millinery business, and am still engaged in that business. I ■did not like to go to the little green house from my business at night; it was not close to my other house, and was some distance out. It was on the other side of the railway, and I had to go by the depot at night. I had a girl living with me. Since I moved away from it, in the spring of 1885, I have rented it when I could My intention was to return to it as my homestead, and I intend it yet as my home, and never intended to abandon it. I moved from my store to the brick house on El Paso Street <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>in the spring of 1886. The brick house is a nice one. I built it on lots owned by me out of money I obtained from the El Paso Building and Loan Association. I built it and moved into it in order to be nearer my business, and there were houses near it, and in going to it I did not have to-pass near the depot. My children are now in Missouri, one at school and one at a relative’s, and since they went away, about six months ago, I have been boarding at Mrs. Brooks’ and lodging at Mrs. Lyons’, and have had my brick house rented, with my furniture in it. The brick house is not fully paid for. It cost about $3000, besides the lots, which are worth about $1000. I owe about $1500 on it yet.”</p>

About May, 1886, my brick house was finished on El Paso Street, and I moved there with my family. I still own the brick house. It is rented by the month while I and my children are away. When I moved into the brick house, I did not intend to give up the little green house entirely as my homestead. The brick house has been my home since I built it in May, 1886, but it was only my temporary home. I thought if I ever quit the millinery business and sold the' place where I now live—the brick house—I would move back to the little green house. This expresses my intention about the matter. When I built the brick house, I intended to live in it, and told other persons so. I built it to live in it. I don’t know how long I intended to live in the brick house. I built it because I would be nearer to my business. The brick house has six rooms and basement, and is built in a good neighborhood on one and one-half lots. It is a neat, convenient place, and is conveniently located with respect to my place of business. My children will be back this fall. I did good business during our marriage and before husband’s death. I have had the little green house property in controversy rented during a part of the time since my husband’s death. The house was not idle much after I left it up to January 1, 1889. I can not say how much rents I have received from it.”</p>

The meaning of her testimony is, that she intends to live upon the new home as long as she continues in the millinery business, and that she expects to continue in that business as long as she lives—if she does not sell the new home.
