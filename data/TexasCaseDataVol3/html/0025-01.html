Many other letters in the correspondence between Davis <em>&amp; </em>Sayles and Rucker in reference to the loan to Jesson were admitted in evidence; for example, Rucker’s letter to Henry Sayles, dated October 30, 1885, forwarding Jesson’s application for the loan of $5000 on the 960 acres of land, with abstract of title, plat, stating that Jesson had sold to Averett, “ which he will close, provided <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>he can raise $5000 on the notes;” requesting, “ if you are willing to make the loan provided his title is made satisfactory, wire me at Belton, and write particulars as to when the loan can be closed and what you wish done.”</p>
    <p id="b57-5" data-blocks='[["BL_57.5",57,[145,527,1302,486]]]'>Reply of Sayles to the foregoing, dated November 3, 1885, pointing out defect in the title, saying that ‘ ‘ if the titles are made perfect, we will loan $5 000 on the land or the purchase money notes. ’ ’ Sayles had pointed out an error in an acknowledgment, and some of the land being school land, had not been fully paid for; but in this correspondence it appears that the State was fully paid and final receipt of the Commissioner of the General Land Office obtained, which was forwarded to Davis <em>&amp; </em>Sayles by Rucker with his “final certificate of examination,” which they were directed to attach to the Jesson abstract then in their hands. This letter is dated December 16, 1885.</p>
    <p id="b57-6" data-blocks='[["BL_57.6",57,[145,1026,1302,236]]]'>Along in the fall of 1886, Rucker wrote some other letters to the company’s general manager, asking extension for Jesson on the note and interest due, forwarding Jesson’s letter to him (Rucker), which stated that he had failed to raise the money, and asking Rucker to write the company for him.</p>
    <p id="b57-7" data-blocks='[["BL_57.7",57,[147,1274,1300,237]]]'>The manager replied to Rucker, enclosing letters to Jesson and Averett as to terms of delay, etc. Rucker replied, saying Averett and Jesson would make the necessary guaranty demanded, and hoped it would be accepted. Negotiations for extension failed, and the land was sold to plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b57-8" data-blocks='[["BL_57.8",57,[146,1523,1302,279]]]'>There was testimony of Rucker and Coleman (the trustee), that Rucker was a land and loan broker, and had customers in his business, and that he would procure loans for them by preparing papers, making applications, and forwarding to an agency able to furnish the money, and the testimony tended to show that this was his relation to the plaintiff, and that Jesson was such a customer of Rucker’s.</p>
    <p id="b57-9" data-blocks='[["BL_57.9",57,[146,1822,1300,85]]]'>Jesson’s testimony denied that Rucker was his agent to procure the loan, and denied that he had paid Rucker for his services.</p>

    <p id="b57-11" data-blocks='[["BL_57.11",57,[147,2019,1300,188]]]'>The banker, Coleman, by whom Jesson’s draft on Davis &amp; Sayers was collected for the $5000, testified that he paid out of the amount after it was collected and put to Jesson’s credit, on Jesson’s checks to Rucker, $300 at one time and $10 at another time, “ for working up the loan.”</p>
    <p id="b57-12" data-blocks='[["BL_57.12",57,[148,2219,1299,88]]]'>The fact proposed to be proved by the defendants was that Rucker was the agent of plaintiff—that he was acting for plaintiff by its authority.</p>

They rely upon their legal rights that the homestead can not be made the subject of debt <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>by any kind of subterfuge or evasion, and that the facts of such attempted evasion in this case were known to plaintiff or its legally authorized agent. They were in nowise deceived. If plaintiff had no notice of the attempted evasion of the law through its agent, it could rely upon the deed and securities offered to secure the loan. Hurt v. Cooper, 63 Texas, 362, et seq.</p>
    <p id="b58-5" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[289,625,1300,386]]]'>An agency may be established by circumstances, as any other fact where it is not required to be in writing. It can only exist by the consent of both principal and agent, but this consent may be inferred from facts showing that it is recognized and acted on by both parties. It can not be shown by the declarations or admissions of the person presuming to act as agent, nor can an agent with authority to act in a particular manner extend his authority by his own declarations. Mech. on Ag., sec. 100; Railway v. Jones, 82 Texas, 156.</p>
    <p id="b58-6" data-blocks='[["BL_58.6",58,[287,1024,1301,137]]]'>The declarations of an agent generally can not be admitted to bind his principal until the agency is established; but when the agency is in paroi and disputed, all the questions may be submitted to the jury together.</p>
    <p id="b58-7" data-blocks='[["BL_58.7",58,[286,1173,1301,227]]]'>Where there is evidence tending to establish an agency, and the fact is in dispute, and paroi evidence is relied on to establish it, it is for the jury to determine from all the evidence whether it exists or not.

    <p id="b58-8" data-blocks='[["BL_58.8",58,[287,1420,1300,536]]]'>Suppose in this case there had been no evidence adduced by plaintiff on this question, could it be said that there was no evidence in the case and none tendered by defendants to prove the fact of Rucker’s agency for plaintiff? We think not. It may be true, that the evidence in rebuttal by plaintiff is of a very convincing character, that it reconciles all the facts with the assumption that Rucker was not the agent of plaintiff, and is consistent throughout with that assumption, and that such should be the conclusion; still it may be asked, who must determine the question—the jury or the court? Evidently the jury. If the facts are undisputed, or the supposed power is in writing, ordinarily the court should construe them, but not where the facts are disputed.</p>
    <p id="b58-9" data-blocks='[["BL_58.9",58,[284,1968,1301,440]]]'>We think the correspondence of Rucker with Davis &lt;&amp; Sayles was admissible upon the question of agency, as well as every act done by Rucker, with their consent, tending to show that he was acting by their authority in this transaction or other transactions in connection witli loans by plaintiff. Such evidence may be fully answered by other evidence on behalf of plaintiff; but the jury must be trusted to decide the question. The court’s power over the question after the verdict is deemed sufficient to prevent injustice in any case. The court can not control the case by rejecting testimony that tends to make a prima facie case by paroi.</p>
    <p id="b58-10" data-blocks='[["BL_58.10",58,[286,2419,1299,89]],["BL_59.1",59,[157,342,1312,290]]]'>There was error in charging the jury to find for plaintiff. The court may have correctly concluded that the evidence was slight, and that the <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>verdict should have been for plaintiff, or that a new trial should be ordered- in case of a verdict for defendants, questions which we do not-decide; yet he should not have invaded the province of the jury in passing upon the facts. Where there is no evidence except that which establishes a given fact, it is proper to instruct the jury to find the fact. Supreme Council v. Anderson, 61 Texas, 296.</p>
