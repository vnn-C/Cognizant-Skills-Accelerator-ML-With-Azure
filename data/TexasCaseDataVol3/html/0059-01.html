It was shown that said defendants finished enclosing said land in a large pasture about the 1st of June, 1883, and have had the same in actual possession, use, and enjoyment from that time up to the time of trial, and that they and those under whom they claim have paid taxes on the land for the years 1847, 1849, 1851,1856, 1859, 1860, 1861, 1862, 1865, 1866, 1867, 1868, 1869, 1870, 1871, 1873, 1875, and 1880; and that Joseph Criswell claimed a half-interest in the land to the time of his death.</p>

Taylor to Joseph Criswell, dated October 18, 1838, and the evidence offered to show performance on the part of Criswell of the obligations imposed by said instrument on him, were not admissible under the defendants’ answer; the contention being, that defendants pleaded specially a legal title, and that therefore testimony tending to show an equitable title in Criswell, and from his heirs to defendants, was not admissible.</p>
    <p id="b92-6" data-blocks='[["BL_92.6",92,[307,847,1301,727]]]'>The rule of law contended for by plaintiff is well settled; but we do not agree with him in the construction placed on the defendants’ answer. The answer did not specifically set up a legal title. It averred, that for a valuable consideration Taylor, on the 18th day of October, 1838, sold and conveyed by deed a one-half interest in the land sued for to Joseph Criswell, and that defendants, by purchase from the heirs of Criswell, held his interest therein. The conveyance from Taylor to Criswell was in the form of a deed, and conveyed an undivided half-interest in the land thereafter to be located by virtue of Taylor’s land certificate, number 133, granted to him by the Board of Land Commissioners of Jasper County, August 4, 1838. It recited a consideration of $450 in hand paid, and the obligation upon the part of Criswell to have the certificate located and pay the government fees thereon. ■ It warranted the title to the one-half interest in the land so conveyed to Criswell. The land sued for is the land referred to in this instrument.</p>
    <p id="b92-7" data-blocks='[["BL_92.7",92,[306,1592,1299,432]]]'>Considering all the terms of the instrument, and the fact that it shows that a considerable part of the consideration had already been paid, it is not clear that, unaided by proof that Criswell located and paid the fees on the land, it did not, when the land was patented to Taylor, vest in Criswell at least an equitable title. At any rate, we think it sufficiently answers the description of the deed from Taylor to Criswell as set up in the defendants’ special answer, and was admissible thereunder, as was also the testimony which the jury were allowed to consider in support of the instrument.</p>

The objection that the conveyance above referred to was not properly authenticated, and therefore not legally recorded, is not tenable. It is true that the certificate of the officer before whom the proof of its execution was made, if detached from the deed and considered independent of the seal attached to the certificate, does not sufficiently disclose that he was authorized to authenticate deeds and other instruments so as to admit them to registration. But when considered in connection with the deed, the caption of which reads “Republic of Texas, County and Town of Jasper,” and in connection with the seal, which contains the words, “Jasper County Court,” we think the certificate discloses the fact that <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>the execution of the deed was proved up before the county clerk of Jasper County, Texas, who was by the law then in force county recorder. McDonald v. Morgan, 27 Texas, 504. The objection that the word <em>assigned </em>instead of <em>signed </em>is used in the certificate is wholly without merit.</p>
    <p id="b93-5" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[144,556,1304,935]]]'>3. One witness, M. H. Martin, first stated, that in his opinion, when McMullen County was created in February, 1858, the land in controversy was in Live Oak County; but he afterwards stated that he did not know and was not certain of that fact. The testimony of other witnesses and the sketches from the Land Office introduced in evidence show very clearly that the John M. Taylor survey never was in Live Oak County; that it is now, and always has been, several miles west of the western line of that county. The land was originally in San Patricio County. The creation of Live Oak County, in 1856, severed San Patricio County in two parts, the land in controversy being embraced in a small strip of territory that was thus separated from the main body of San Patricio County.. It is also true, that by the Act of December 8, 1857, defining the boundaries of San Patricio County, the strip referred to, including the land here involved, was left out of San Patricio County, and not embraced in the limits of any county. This strip of land became a part of McMullen County, which was created by the Act of February 1, 1858. It is not affirmatively shown when McMullen County was organized. However, the sheriff's deed executed February 2, 1875, under which plaintiff claims the land, recites that McMullen County was then unorganized.</p>
    <p id="b93-6" data-blocks='[["BL_93.6",93,[145,1501,1311,634]]]'>In so far as we have been able to ascertain, McMullen County was not attached for judicial purposes to any other county until, by the Act of February 14, 1860, it was attached to Live Oak County. The conveyance from John M. Taylor to Joseph Criswell was recorded June 16, 1859,, in San Patricio County; and if at this time this was the proper county for the registration of deeds and other instruments relating to the John M. Taylor survey, then the question of innocent purchaser is eliminated! from the case. McMullen County at that time not being organized nor attached for judicial purposes to an organized county, San Patricio, the mother county, had jurisdiction, and was the proper place for the registration of the deed.

It was shown that Taylor always recognized and never disputed Criswell’s claim to the land; and the only testimony tending to show repudiation by any one is the fact of the execution sale in 1875, and the further fact that in 1882 the plaintiff leased the land to a tenant, who was occupying an adjoining survey, the term of which lease expired April 1, 1885. But no possession of the land in controversy was taken or held by the tenant under said lease, and it was not shown that plaintiff or those <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>under whom he claims ever had possession of any of the land. The testimony shows that the defendants took possession in 1883, and have been in actual adverse possession ever since. Under these facts, even if the defendants’ title be only an equitable one, the doctrine of stale demand can not avail to defeat it. If it be conceded that the legal title to the entire survey vested in Taylor when the land was granted to him in 1847, and was held by plaintiff at the time of the trial, nevertheless, as it was shown that Criswell performed his part of the contract, and as the defendants, holding under him, went into possession of the land in less than ten years after the first act of repudiation on the part of the holder of the legal title, the doctrine of stale demand has no application, and can not defeat their superior equitable title to half of the land. Goode v. Lowery, 70 Texas, 150; Wilson v. Simpson, 80 Texas, 279.</p>
    <p id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[311,1004,1303,436]]]'>5. It follows from what has been said, that under the facts disclosed by the record, the plaintiff is not entitled to but half of the land sued for, and this the judgment of the court has awarded to him. We do not concur with the plaintiff in his contention that the defendants’ answer sets up title otherwise than by limitation to a specific half of the survey. The judgment awards an undivided half of the land to the plaintiff and the other undivided half to the defendants, and we do not understand the plaintiff as complaining that he was not accorded the right of. selection which Taylor had under the conveyance from him to Criswell.</p>
    <p id="b94-6" data-blocks='[["BL_94.6",94,[310,1452,1301,139]]]'>As under the uncontroverted facts plaintiff was only entitled to half the land, we deem it unnecessary to consider the various assignments relating to charges given and refused.</p>
