    <p id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[134,623,1301,588]]]'>“ That said cotton was delivered On said platform with the knowledge and consent of the defendant’s said agent at Rhome, and at the time it was always the custom of persons intending to ship cotton over said railway to place said cotton on said platform, and the placing of it there was always regarded and held by both the persons putting it there and the defendant as a delivery thereof to defendant, and that by delivery of said cotton on said platform it was received by defendant for shipment. That it was the general custom of defendant to receive cotton for shipment on said platform, and that it had no other place at Rhome for receiving cotton for shipment but said platform. That said cotton was placed on said platform by plaintiffs for the purpose of being shipped over defendant’s and connecting lines of railway to Liverpool, England.</p>

    <p id="b583-7" data-blocks='[["BL_583.7",583,[132,1370,1302,386]]]'>From the allegations of the foregoing petition, it appears that the cotton in question had been delivered to the defendant, and was in its custody by virtue of a contract of shipment, and that while in its custody, it was destroyed because of the negligence of the defendant. These facts, we think, constitute a cause of action. No bill of lading was necessary to render the company responsible for negligence in taking care of the property thus delivered and in its custody.
