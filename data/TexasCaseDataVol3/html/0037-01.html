Vendor’s Lien on Sale of Homestead—Wife not a Necessary Party.—Husband and wife executed their deed for their homestead.

The court should not instruct the jury to find a ratification in case of unreasonable delay after notice of the facts, but should leave the delay and its circumstances to the jury tp determine whether a ratification should be inferred.</p>

The grantees should be allowed the privilege of ascertaining the value of the land from any other reasonable source.</p>

This was done, the indebtedness being acknowledged as a cash payment; the balance was to be paid in goods for use in Smith’s business. Smith remained in possession, <em>chargeable </em>with rent at <em>$10 per </em>month. The contract price for the lot was $1000. Smith and wife executed a warranty deed for the lot, which was forwarded to-the grantees. Some correspondance followed about the matter. Suit was by the husband alone.

Appellee claims, that by reason of the premises appellants became liable to pay him the said sum of $721.20, and that by virtue of the premises he and his wife held a vendor’s lien on said lands for said sum of $721.20.</p>

    <p id="b66-9" data-blocks='[["BL_66.9",66,[277,1461,1299,637]]]'>The bill of exceptions upon the point shows, that while the preliminary argument upon the plea to the jurisdiction was proceeding, the court, of its own motion, informed defendants’ counsel that because defendants had before filed a general demurrer and general denial, it would not consider the plea to the jurisdiction, and would for that reason overrule the same; thereupon defendants’ counsel offered to prove by the attorney who filed the demurrer and denial that it was done as á favor to plaintiff’s counsel, and to allow him to proceed to take testimony, and with the distinct understanding that the same should not have the effect of preventing defendants from filing any plea they desired to file.

There was no other security in this case. It could not be inferred as a fact or by implication of law that the promise to pay in something else than money is a waiver. There is nothing in the promise to pay in goods that would change this part of the obligation. If the debt be not discharged in goods, it becomes a money demand, and the lien can be enforced as upon a promissory note. An exchange of lands is no waiver of the lien in case the title to one of the parties fail. White v. Street, 67 Texas, 177; Claybrooks v. Kelly, 61 Texas, 634.

We have been unable as yet to obtain any satisfactory information, but will likely receive full particulars within the next two days; when received you will hear from us definitely. It was <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>not our intention to buy the property, and in making arrangements as Mr. Botto did, is a matter for which we are unable to account. Evidently, Mr. Botto does not know how to arrange such matters. It is such a great distance away, you will see, that to own the property would be placing us to a very great disadvantage. As it appears to be your desire to settle your account with us, why not give us a deed of trust on same, covering amount of your indebtedness, and stipulate that we are to advance you from $300 to $500 worth of goods, payable twelve months after date. The latter matter to be covered by note. In this manner you will secure about the same accommodation as if you would make the sale outright, and yet retain your property, and at the same time receive ample time to discharge your obligations. In making this deal you are absolutely protected against loss, and at the same time we would be much more satisfied than if we had to take the property.</p>

    <p id="b69-7" data-blocks='[["BL_69.7",69,[144,1274,1301,535]]]'>We concur with them in this proposition. Neither of the letters affirmed the act of the agent in making the purchase, and it is not pretended by defendant in error that such was the effect of the letters; the contention is, that the last letter showed the receipt of the deed and the character of the transaction, and that Meyer, Bannerman <em>&amp; </em>Co. were bound to repudiate the purchase in a reasonable time thereafter, or be deemed to have ratified it. A failure to disaffirm the unauthorized act of an agent by the principal in a reasonable time after full knowledge of the facts will sometimes work an estoppel; that is, when the relations of the parties are changed, and innocent third persons are injured by the delay. Mech. on Ag., secs. 153-157.</p>
    <p id="b69-8" data-blocks='[["BL_69.8",69,[143,1821,1303,532]]]'>Mere delay in repudiating will not, in our opinion, have the effect of ratifying. It would be evidence along with other facts from which, if it should be unreasonable, the jury might infer that there was a ratification. The court should not instruct the jury to find a ratification in case of unreasonable delay after notice of the facts, but he should leave the jury free to act upon such fact and to determine from all the facts whether a ratification should be inferred, or whether there was an estoppel.

It assumes that the deed furnished full knowledge of the facts, and that the receipt of it was all that was required to jiut defendants in possession of the facts. <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>Evidently defendants would have the privilege of ascertaining from any source they desired the value of the land. The value would be to them an important consideration in accepting the deed with its obligations. The charge should not have assumed that the deed was sufficient for this-purpose. Etheridge v. Price, 73 Texas, 597.</p>
    <p id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[281,572,1304,287]]]'>The eighth assignment of error is: “ The court erred in that part of paragraph 6 of the main charge, where it instructed the jury, that ‘ if defendants delayed an unreasonable time after receiving the deed and writing the letters before mentioned, if they did receive it and write said letter, before notifying plaintiff of their refusal to abide by its terms or to accept said land, then a subsequent refusal would be of no avail.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b70-6" data-blocks='[["BL_70.6",70,[328,872,1251,39]]]'>What we have before said is sufficient to show the error in this charge.</p>
    <p id="b70-7" data-blocks='[["BL_70.7",70,[279,921,1301,287]]]'>Of course, if the jury should find that there was a ratification, any subsequent refusal to ratify would be of no avail. But we think it would have been better to have allowed the jury to form their own conclusion from all the testimony tending to show acquiescence or disaffirmance, on the part of defendants, giving it such weight as they should deem warranted by the circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b70-8" data-blocks='[["BL_70.8",70,[279,1220,1301,237]]]'>We do not think it was proper to instruct the jury to the effect, that if defendants received the deed and intended to hold the same and accept its terms, provided they could secure no more satisfactory arrangement with plaintiff, then they would be bound by such intention, and would be liable according to the terms of the deed.</p>
    <p id="b70-9" data-blocks='[["BL_70.9",70,[278,1470,1299,240]]]'>The question was one of ratification or not, to be decided by the jury, and not whether the deed was conditionally ratified. If there was a ratification, or if the facts warranted the jury in presuming such ratification, their verdict should have been for plaintiff below; if there was not a binding ratification, the verdict should have been for defendants below.</p>
