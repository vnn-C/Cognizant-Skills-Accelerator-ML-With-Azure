When the issues adjudicated are not shown by the record, and the effect of the judgment depends upon the ground upon which it is based, evidence is admissible to show such grounds, and as the record itself shows that no such judgment was rendered as would preclude appellees from asserting this claim, the admission of the evidence was harmless.</p>

He died pending suit, and his death was suggested of record, and plaintiffs by supplemental petition procured service to be made upon Mrs. Davis, the other partner. She pleaded in abatement that the heirs of J. P. Davis should be made parties. Judgment was not sought against them, nor against the estate of J. P.

She was the surviving partner, as appeared from the pleadings, though not named as such, and could be sued on causes of action which had arisen against the firm. The fact that her partner had been originally served and that she had not been joined did not deprive plaintiffs of their right to make her a party after his death, and to prosecute their claim against her and the partnership assets, she having the capacity to represent both for such purposes.</p>

The latter assigned it to appellees, who notified appellants of such assignment. Thereafter Kohlman <em>&amp; </em>Co., creditors of Deimel <em>&amp; </em>Co., sued them and caused a garnishment to be served on appellants. The attorney representing the latter, not having been notified by them of the assignment by Deimel <em>&amp; </em>Co. to appellees, answered the garnishment, admitting the indebtedness, and upon this answer Kohlman <em>&amp; </em>Co. subsequently took judgment against appellees as garnishees.</p>

It seems plain that this was no adjudication of the issue presented in this cause. The point decided on the motions was, that the parties could not get behind the judgment which had been rendered against the garnishees. Without going behind that judgment, the court in that case had no occasion, to investigate the title of appellees to the debt.

It was the duty of appellants, when garnished by Kohlman &amp; Co., having received notice of the assignment of the debt which they owed to Deimel <em>&amp; </em>Co., to take proper steps to protect themselves from double liability. The service of the garnishment did not make it the duty of appellees to contest it.
