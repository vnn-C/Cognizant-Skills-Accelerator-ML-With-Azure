That at and near Temple, on said road, one of appellant’s servants (a brakesman) entered the car and took his valise, overcoat, and lap rug from the seat in front of the one occupied by appellee, and threw them on the floor in an insulting manner, while the floor was dirty and filthy.

If the jury believe from the evidence, that the conductor of defendant’s passenger train, on the 2nd of May, 1889, expelled and ejected plaintiff off and from said train, on account of and for the reason that plaintiff had rudely displayed a pistol, and you further believe from the ■evidence that such rude display of said pistol was occasioned by any acts ■or conduct of the conductor or brakeman of said train at and towards plaintiff; and you further believe from the evidence that such acts and ■conduct, if any, were of such a nature as was calculated to create in the mind of plaintiff a reasonable apprehension that his person or baggage was in danger from an unlawful attack by said conductor or brakeman, and that such danger, if any, was of such a nature as was calculated to create in the mind of plaintiff a reasonable belief that the necessity had arisen that authorized plaintiff to draw or display said pistol for the purpose of protecting his person or baggage, if any, from said attack, if any, then in that event said conductor would not be justified in expelling and removing plaintiff from said train.</p>

If you believe from the evidence that the defendant had a rule, on May 2, 1889, that prohibited passengers on board of its passenger cars from occupying more than one seat, either by his person or baggage; and you further find from the evidence that plaintiff at said time so occupied more than one seat by placing his baggage thereon; and you further believe from the evidence, that said occupancy was under the belief, upon the part of plaintiff, that he was not violating the rules of the company; and you further believe from the evidence that such occupancy of said seat occasioned no injury or inconvenience toother passengers in said car, and that such occupancy, if any, was of such a character as would not in any material manner be violative of said rules of defendant, to its injury or inconvenience; and you further believe that at said time plaintiff had no purpose or intent to violate said rules in any material manner; and if you further believe from the evidence that the brakeman and conductor of said train attempted to correct said violation, if any, of said rules upon the part of plaintiff, and in so doing they resorted to such means as were necessary to accomplish such purpose, and in such manner as was calculated to create a reasonable apprehension in plaintiff’s mind that his person or property was in danger of a serious and unlawful attack by said conductor and brakeman, and that the same, if any, was of such a nature as was calculated to create a reasonable apprehension in plaintiff’s mind that a necessity had arisen that would authorize him to repel said attack, then in that event plaintiff would be justified in resist<a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>ing said conductor and brakeman, and the expulsion of plaintiff from said car under such circumstances would be wrong.’ ’</p>
    <p id="b652-5" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[291,435,1308,536]]]'>The court had already instructed the jury as follows: “ The first question for you to decide is, were the acts of said conductor and brakeman as against plaintiff wrongful—that is, without lawful authority; and in this connection you are instructed, that a conductor on a train has the right-to have a passenger removed from his train, if said passenger is conducting himself in an unlawful manner; and further, that such conductor has a right, and it is his duty, to enforce all reasonable rules and regulations - of the railroad company. And if a conductor, in enforcing such rules, or in ejecting a passenger under such circumstances, uses only such force-as is necessary to accomplish these objects, the railroad is subject to no-liability for the act of the conductor in such case. * * *</p>

In this connection you are instructed, that if plaintiff' at and just prior to the ejection of him was not acting in an unlawful manner, but was only taking such steps as were reasonably necessary to-protect himself or his property from violence or injury, then his ejection from said train was wrongful, and he is entitled to recover from defendant such damage as is the natural and proximate result of said wrongful acts.”</p>

These charges contradict the main charge of the court, and instructed the jury, in substance, that notwithstanding the plaintiff was violating the rules of the company by occupying more than one seat, when other passengers-were not thereby interfered with that he had a right to violate the rules, and that any attempt on the part of the conductor to enforce the rules-would justify him (plaintiff) in resisting the conductor in his attempt to enforce the rules; and that his expulsion from the car under such circum<a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>stances, notwithstanding he maintained his alleged right to violate the rules by rudely displaying his pistol in the car in the presence of the other passengers, some of whom were ladies, sitting in front of him, was wrong. The rule confining passengers to one seat is admitted; and if a passenger persists in violating any reasonable rule of the company, it is the right and duty of the conductor to enforce the rule, and if necessary to eject the passenger from the train, using, of course, only such force as is necessary to enforce the rule or eject the passenger. It may be that his ejection from the car by a peace officer was perfected with less serious consequences than if it had been attempted by the conductor.</p>
