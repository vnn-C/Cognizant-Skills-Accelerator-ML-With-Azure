      <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>7. Appellee also introduced in evidence a general warranty deed, dated January 1, 1884, signed “ W. S. Jones, Rosa Jones, by their attorney in fact, William J. Jones,” and purporting to convey the land in controversy to appellee Dan Robbins, which deed was duly acknowledged by William J. Jones as agent before a notary public. It recites a consideration of $500 cash and the execution of a promissory note by Robbins for $500, and retains a lien to secure the payment of the note. The testimony shows that this note has been paid.</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.5",228,[284,721,1300,287]]]'>8. The controlling issue of fact in the case is whether or not the property in question was the homestead of appellants, W. S. and Rosa Jones, January 1, 1884, when the last above named deed was executed. The verdict of the jury involves a finding that it had been abandoned, and was not at that time their homestead; and we conclude that there is testimony supporting this finding.</p>

    <p id="b228-8" data-blocks='[["BL_228.8",228,[283,1268,1300,188]]]'>The case hinged upon a question of fact, namely: Had appellants, by abandonment, lost their homestead rights in the property involved when the deed of January 1, 1884, was executed, and which passed the title to appellee if the property was not then appellants'" homestead ?</p>
    <p id="b228-9" data-blocks='[["BL_228.9",228,[281,1469,1301,435]]]'>On this issue there is conflict in the testimonjr. They were not occupying the property as a home when the deed was executed; there is testimony tending to show that they left it with the avowed purpose never to return to it, and other evidence tending to show that they only contemplated a temporary absence, and intended to return and use it as a home. The power of attorney under which the agent acted in making the sale recites, that they are about to remove from the State, and although appellants must have known their own intentions better than any one else, <em>neither of them testified at the trial.</em>
