The venue was sufficiently shown by the allegations of the petition, and the evidence thereunder, which sustained it. The statute confers the right to sue a corporation in any county where it has an agency or representative.</p>

The citizens were to secure the right of way; all of it had not been secured, but the subscriptions had been collected and appropriated by the company, and the road had not been built as agreed; wherefore the plaintiffs showed a cause of action, and were entitled to judgment for the sum of their subscriptions.</p>

The evidence introduced upon the plea setting up the facts in abatement consisted of the obligation sued on and the testimony of I. H. Hollis, to the effect that when the suit was filed witness was secretary and treasurer of the defendant company, and had, at the time of the trial, some of the books of the company. Defendant L. W. Lloyd resided in Harrison County, Texas, and the other defendants resided in Tarrant County, at Fort Worth, and had never resided in San Augustine County; that no part of the road had been built in San Augustine County, and no part of it at all was completed or in operation anywhere. Some grading had been done in Nacogdoches County, and the road had been located from Nacogdoches to San Augustine. Most of the business of the road was transacted at Nacogdoches, except some money was forwarded to witness at San Augustine to be paid out for the company. As originally chartered, the road was to run from Nacogdoches to San Augustine, and the charter was afterwards amended so as to extend it to Fort Worth. The last election of officers of the company was held at Fort Worth. Witness is one of the plaintiffs in this suit. It also appears from the general statement of facts, from the evidence of Hollis, that in 1889 he was secretary and treasurer of the company, and as such he received for the company the subscriptions which plaintiffs alleged had been paid to it. This evidence is sufficient, we think, to establish as to the railway company the exception to the general statute of venue, that suits against a private corporation can be commenced in any county in which such corporation has an agency or representative. Although Hollis was one of the plaintiffs, this fact would not deprive the plaintiffs of the right to sue the company in San Augustine County, because it was none the less true that the company had an agency and representative in the county. Service of process was not made upon Hollis, but upon the president. The venue can not be sustained on the ground that the contract was to be performed in San Augustine County. If we construe together, as we may, the contract to guarantee the payment of the subscription and the obligation sued on to refund the samé, there is no agreement shown to repay in San Augustine County.

    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[292,2069,1299,287]]]'>But the question now arises, whether the ability to sue the company in San Augustine County would confer the right to sue there also the sureties, who all resided in Tarrant County. To so hold would be to hold, that whenever by an exception to the statute of venue one defendant may be sued in a county, other defendants who do not reside in the county may be sued there also on account of another exception.</p>

It is sought to make an exception of the case of the sureties, because there is an exception in the case of the railway company; but the sureties may be sued in San Augustine County only in the event that the railway company has its domicile in San Augustine County, which is not shown to be the case.
