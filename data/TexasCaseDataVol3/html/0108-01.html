Motion to Set Aside Judgment Sale of Land.—Appellee having a judgment foreclosing a lien against one Morrison, caused an order of sale to be issued to San Jacinto County for the sale of the land, and Hansbro became the purchaser at $12.80. Motion was made in Galveston to set aside the sale for inadequacy of price and irregularity and fraud in the sale, and for a resale of the property, and notice of the motion was served on Hansbro and Morrison. <em>Held, </em>the District Court of Galveston County had jurisdiction, and the sale was rightly set aside.</p>

Same—Jurisdiction of Court over a Stranger to the Judgment.—The right of a judgment creditor to apply by motion to the court in which his judgment was obtained to set aside a sale which, through irregularities in making it, has resulted in a sacrifice of the property, has been recognized by our Supreme Court in many cases. Courts of equity have .always entertained such motions. The reason for the exercise of such a power over a purchaser who is a stranger to the original suit is, that by a purchase under its process he submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court over such process, and becomes subject to its power to revoke an improper sale.</p>

Jurisdiction, How Obtained — Power of the Court. —The jurisdiction is simply that which the court obtained over the subject matter in the original action. By the rendition of the judgment it was not exhausted, but continued in full force in order to secure to the plaintiff the fruits of his recovery. It required the issuance and lawful execution of process, and involved the power to control the sheriff in the performance of his duty, and to prevent not only him but all other persons from abusing the writ. A purchaser under its writ took <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>such title as he thereby obtained, subject to the power in the court to see that the sale was properly and lawfully conducted, and to revoke it if it was not.</p>

Jurisdiction over Resident of Another County.—The fact that the sale was made and the purchaser resided in another county, can not affect this power. To hold that it doeg, would cripple the power of the court to render complete relief to the party who had secured its judgment, and make its decrees dependent on the action of other tribunals for adequate enforcement. The statutes regulating venue have reference to original actions, and not to such auxiliary proceedings as are involved in the exercise of jurisdiction in cases over which it has already vested.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b135-6" data-blocks='[["BL_135.6",135,[146,741,1296,329]]]'>5. Irregularities in Sheriff’s Sale.—It is the duty of the sheriff, in selling property, to make it bring as much as can be obtained, and to allow to persons desiring to purchase all reasonable opportunity to bid. It appears in this case that at least one person was prevented from bidding by unnecessary haste in closing the sale. The jury were warranted in concluding that the price paid was grossly inadequate; that this inadequacy was produced in part, at least, by failure of the sheriff to afford proper opportunities to others to buy, and that in a proper legal sense the sale was not fairly made.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b135-7" data-blocks='[["BL_135.7",135,[145,1078,1299,285]]]'>6. Remarks of Counsel.—Blum’s counsel, in his closing argument to the jury, said to them: -‘If you do not set aside this sale, old man Morrison will lose his land, and get a credit of only $3.50 on Blum’s judgment against him for over $1700.” These remarks were not probably calculated to have any improper influence. They were based upon evidence in the case, and the strongest complaint that could be urged against them would be, that they stated a reason for setting aside the sale of which appellee could not avail himself.</p>

A purchaser under its writ took such title as he thereby obtained, subject to this power in the court to see that the sale was properly and lawfully conducted, and to revoke it if it was not. We think the fact that the sale was made, and that the purchaser resided in another county than that in which the decree was rendered, can not affect this power. To hold that it does would cripple the power of the court to render complete relief to the party who had secured its judgment, and make its decrees dependent on the action of other tribunals for adequate enforcement. For if this proposition were admitted, the merest form of a sale, if made in another county, to a stranger to the suit, lacking all the qualities essential to carry out the substantial objects of the decree, would put an end to the power of the court over its process.

It appears in this case that, in all probability, at least one person was prevented from bidding by unnecessary haste in closing the sale.</p>
    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[148,775,1301,237]]]'>We conclude that the verdict is sustained by the evidence. The jury were warranted in concluding that the price paid was grossly inadequate, that this inadequacy was produced, in part at least, by failure of the sheriff to afford proper opportunities to others to buy, and that, in a proper legal sense, the sale was not fairly made.</p>
    <p id="b139-6" data-blocks='[["BL_139.6",139,[147,1023,1303,380]]]'>The remarks of appellee’s counsel were not probably calculated to have any improper influence. They were based upon evidence in the case, and the strongest complaint that could be urged against them would be that they stated a reason for setting aside the sale, of which appellee could not avail himself—in other words, that they involved an unsound proposition. The court corrected that, and it can not be held that mistaken positions assumed by counsel in argument will of themselves afford ground for new trial.</p>
    <p id="b139-7" data-blocks='[["BL_139.7",139,[193,1424,465,37]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
