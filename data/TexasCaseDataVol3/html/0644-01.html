McIntosh, 73 Georgia, 532, where a passenger’s baggage checked through was lost, it was held, that the last road was liable, notwithstanding the first road would also be liable, as had been before decided by the same court. <a href="/ga/62/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="62 Ga. 347" data-case-ids="21795" data-case-paths="/ga/62/0347-01">62 Ga., 347</a>. Of course, the receiving company may shift responsibility by showing that the freight was delivered to its connecting line; and so may the delivering company of damaged goods, by making proof that it received the goods in a damaged condition.

    <p id="b674-7" data-blocks='[["BL_674.7",674,[265,1614,1299,229]]]'>In a case like the one at bar, where it is shown that the jewelry contained in a locked trunk was a total loss, and was never delivered at destination in any condition, it would be more in consonance with the principle upon which the distinction rests, to hold the receiving company liable.</p>
    <p id="b674-8" data-blocks='[["BL_674.8",674,[263,1864,1301,137]]]'>If there is to be a presumption at all, it ought to be against the company who is proved to have received the goods, rather than the company who has not been shown to have had possession of them in any condition.</p>
    <p id="b674-9" data-blocks='[["BL_674.9",674,[261,2014,1302,285]]]'>When defendant received the goods, it became liable to carry them and deliver them to the next line, but was not liable for the further carriage under the contract. The contract specially excepted such liability; in the absence of all testimony explaining the loss, it devolved upon defendant to show that the loss fell within the exception. It is impossible to say that the exception exists.</p>
    <p id="b674-10" data-blocks='[["BL_674.10",674,[264,2312,1301,187]]]'>This being so, and the reason of the rule authorizing a presumption against the last carrier having no application in case of á total loss, we think defendant should be required to show that the contracted exception applies.</p>

    <p id="b675-5" data-blocks='[["BL_675.5",675,[155,518,1299,185]]]'>Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the onus was upon defendant to show that it came within the exception stipulated in the ticket contract.

    <p id="b675-6" data-blocks='[["BL_675.6",675,[157,716,1302,337]]]'>If we are correct in the foregoing conclusion, it must also be held, that-there was no error in rendering judgment for the full value of the property lost; Defendant is held to be liable for the loss, upon the ground that it occurred upon its own road. The restriction as to liability in the-contract as to value was illegal. A common carrier can not contract against liability for its own negligence. Railway v.
