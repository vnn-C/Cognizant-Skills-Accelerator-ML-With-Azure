Judgment Conclusive of Title—Partition and Writ of Possession not Essential, when.—In a suit of trespass to try title by L., against W. as defendant and M. as intervenor, W. recovered 200 acres of the land, M. the remaining420 acres, and plaintiff nothing; the judgment reciting that should W. and M. fail to designate the boundaries, or have surveyed by agreement the 200 acres adjudged to W. within one month from adjournment of court, “ then -are hereby appointed commissioners of partition to allot said 200 acres to W., and report their action to the next term of this court.” No division was made by agreement, and no commissioners were appointed to make it, nor was any writ of possession issued. Within the two years allowed for suing out writ of error, plaintiff L. compromised with M., each to take one-half (undivided) of the 420 acres adjudged to M., who afterwards conveyed his interest to B. and to other parties. W. having died, L. filed suit for partition more than three years after the judgment, asking that it be carried out and his 210 acres set apart to him, to which B. and W. answered, claiming all the land, and setting up the three, five, and ten years limitations. <em>Held, </em>that the judgment in the former suit was a final adjudication of the title, conclusive as between all parties thereto and those claiming under them.</p>

Daly, 26 Texas, 730; Harris v. Hardeman, 27 Texas, 248; Spring v. Eisenach, 51 Texas, 435; Long v. Brennerman, 59 Texas, 211; Paxton v. Meyer, 67 Texas, 96; Snowden v. Rush, 69 Texas, 593; Blum v. Rogers, 71 Texas, 677, and Grigsby v. May, 84 Texas, 254, it is held, that after a sale of the land by the owner, neither he nor those claiming under him can, prescribe under the three years statute. After such sale he no longer has title or color of title within the meaning of the law. We think the same effect should be attributed to this decree. After its rendition neither A. G. Walker nor his heirs could be said to have either title or color of title from the sovereignty of the soil to the 440 acres of which they were thereby divested. We are also of opinion, that any right the parties to that judgment may have acquired by reason of their possession prior to -its rendition was thereby cancelled, in so far as it could be used against the successful party therein or those claiming under him, and that such possession can not be tacked to their possession since the judgment, to complete the time required by either of the statutes. If we are correct in this conclusion, we need not have considered the question as to whether or not the change in the form of plaintiff’s suit, from one of <em>“ </em>partition "’ to <em>“ </em>trespass to try title and partition,” was the institution of a new suit within the meaning of the law; but we have considered it, and are clearly ■of the opinion that there was no such change in the cause of action asserted in the two petitions as would prevent the first from having the effect to stop the running of the statute.</p>

Walker, Jr., claimed. These bore date long previous to the decree of January 14, 1882, and he was a party to that judgment.</p>

Laws, to show that previous to the rendition of the decree of January 14, 1882, he had conveyed all his interest in the land to John H. Cole. Laws’ title prior to this decree is not important in this case, as the com<a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>promise agreement with Marshall reinvested him with sufficient title to maintain this suit, even though he had previously parted with it.</p>

We have already held that the filing of the amended petition in December, 1886, was not the institution of a new suit; and if we are correct in this, it was entirely proper that the proceeding be continued in the name of the original parties until its final termination.

    <p id="b562-6" data-blocks='[["BL_562.6",562,[275,812,1304,825]]]'>The court did not err in refusing to exclude from the jury the deposition of J. J. Jarvis, because the letter by which he refreshed his memory was not attached. The only use made of this letter by the witness was-to refresh his memory as to the date of the transaction about which he was testifying, and he distinctly says the letter “ called to his mind the date,” and not that he remembers writing the letter and knew at the time it was dated correctly. Mr. Greenleaf says: “ The cases in which such writings are proper to be used may be divided into three classes: (1) Where the writing is used only for the purpose of assisting the memory of the witness. In this case it does not seem necessary that the writing should be produced in court, though its absence may afford a matter of observation to the jury, for the witness at last testifies from his own recollection.” 1 Greenl. on Ev., sec. 437. The witness was not asked to attach the letter in the interrogatories, nor was any effort made to quash the deposition before entering into the trial. The objection was not made until the deposition was read, and the court was then- asked to exclude it.</p>

Marshall to testify to the conversation between him and Robert Bailey at the time of the sale of the land to him. This evidence was correctly admitted to show notice to Bailey, at the time he made the purchase, of the previous compromise between Marshall and Laws, and of the conveyance from Marshall to Smith <em>&amp; </em>Jarvis.</p>

The judgment of January 14, 1882, was the common source of title of all the parties, and they were not required to go further than this. A party to a suit of trespass to try title can not introduce another and different title to that specially pleaded by him, but he is not required to introduce all of the links set forth in his plea, if he <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>can show a better title than his adversary by introducing only a part of them.</p>

It seems that they have paid the taxes upon all the land for a series of years, and in their answer they seek contribution in case they lose the land. Where one cotenant removes an encumbrance, such as a tax lien, upon the whole land, it would seem clear upon principles of equity that he should be subrogated to such lien to secure contribution from his cotenant for his share. Freem. on Co ten. and Part., 263. It seems, however, in this case, that during the years the defendants paid these taxes they had possession and the use of the entire land; and while it is true one tenant can not be made to pay his cotenant rent where he has actually occupied the land himself until demand and refusal of joint occupancy (Thompson v. Jones, 77 Texas, 626), yet we believe that when he has had possession of the entire premises and asks that his cotenant be made to pay a part of the taxes, this should only be allowed upon an adjustment of the equities between them, and that this can be done when the report of the commissioners is returned, and it is known what part, if any, of the improvements these defendants lose.</p>
