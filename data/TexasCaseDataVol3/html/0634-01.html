That this was occasioned by annual rises in the river from 1858 to the time of filing the pre-emption claims by appellants, and by the peculiar formation and shape of the banks at that point. The Burdett survey was situated on the north bank of the river, and called for a stake on the bank of the river and to run down the river with its meanders.

This right rests upon the consideration, that while the riparian owner is liable to lose soil by the action of the water, he should also have the benefit of accretion resulting from the same cause. The principle is, that “ he who bears the incidental burdens of an acquisition is entitled to its incidental advantages; consequently, that the proprietor of a field bounded by a river, being exposed to the danger of loss from its floods, is entitled to the increment which from the same cause may be gradually annexed to it.” Accretion by alluvion, or the addition and gains to the soil by a recession of the water and the channel of the river, must be by a process that is gradual and imperceptible; otherwise the change falls within the meaning of avulsion, and such rapid and sudden change of the channel or banks of the stream will not bring about a change of boundary of the lands of the riparian proprietors.</p>

Land Company, 134 United States, 178, 189 (10 Supreme Court Reporter, 518). A question between -individuals, growing out of changes in the very place now in controversy, was then before this court; and in the opinion, after referring to the general rule, it was observed: ‘ It is contended by the defendant, that this well settled rule is not applicable to land which borders on the Missouri River, because of the peculiar character of that stream, and of the soil through which it flows, the course of the river being tortuous, the current rapid, and the soil a soft, sandy loam, not protected from the action of water either by rocks or the roots of trees; the effect being that the river cuts away its banks, sometimes in a large body, and makes for itself a new course, while the earth thus removed is almost simultaneously deposited elsewhere, and new land is formed almost as rapidly as the former bank was carried away. But it has been held by this court that the general law of accretion is applicable to land on the Mississippi River; and that being so, although the changes on the Missouri River are greater and more rapid than on the Mississippi, the difference does not constitute such a difference in principle as to render inapplicable to the Missouri River ■the general rule of law.’ It is true that that case came here on demurrer to a bill, and it was alleged in the bill that the land was formed by <em>‘ </em>imperceptible degrees,’ and that the process of accretion ‘ went on so slowly that it could not be observed in its progress; but at intervals of not less than three or more months, it could be discerned by the eye that additions greater or less had been made to the shore.’ The state of facts disclosed by this averment was held not to take the case out of the law concerning accretion; and, after referring to some English authorities, it was said: ‘ The doctrine of the English cases is, that accretion is an addition to land coterminous with the water, which is formed so slowly that its progress can not be perceived, and does not admit of the view that, in order to be accretion, the formation must be one not discernible by comparison at two distant points of time.’ And then was quoted from the <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>opinion in St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wallace, 46, these words: ‘ The test as to what is gradual and imperceptible, in the sense of the rule, is, that though the witnesses may see from time to time that progress has been made, they could not perceive it while the process was going on.’</p>

But what are the facts apparent from that testimony? The Missouri River is a winding stream, coursing through a valley of varying width, the substratum of whose soil, a deposit of distant centuries, is largely of quicksand. In building the bridge of the Union Pacific Railway Company across the Missouri River in the vicinity of the tracts in controversy, the builders went down to the solid rock, 65 feet below the surface, and there found a pine log a foot and a half in diameter—of course a deposit made in the long ago. The current is rapid, far above the average of ordinary rivers; and by reason of the snows in the mountains there are two well known rises in the volume of its waters, known as the April and June rises. The large volume of water pouring down at the time of these rises, with the rapidity of its current, has great and rapid action upon the loose soil of its banks. Whenever it impinges with direct attack upon the bank at a bend of the stream, and that bank is of the loose sand obtaining in the valley of the Missouri, it is not strange that the abrasion and washing away is rapid and great. Frequently, where above the loose substratum of sand there is a deposit of comparatively solid soil, the washing out of the underlying sand causes an instantaneous fall of quite a length and breadth of the superstratum of soil into the river; so that it may, in one sense of the term, be said that the diminution of the banks is not gradual and imperceptible, but sudden and visible. Notwithstanding this, two things must be borne in mind, familiar to all dwellers on the banks of the Missouri River, and disclosed by the testimony: that while there may be an instantaneous and obvious dropping into the river of quite a portion of its banks, such portion is not carried down the stream as a solid and compact mass, but disintegrates and separates into particles of earth borne onward by the flowing water, and giving to the stream that color which, in the history of the country, has made it known as the ‘muddy’ Missouri; and also, that while the disappearance, by reason of this process, of a mass of bank may be sudden and obvious, there is no transfer of such a solid body of earth to the opposite shore, or anything like an instantaneous and visible creation of a bank on that shore. The accretion, whatever may be the fact in respect to the diminution, is always gradual, and by the imperceptible deposit of floating particles of earth. There is, except in such cases of avulsion as may be noticed hereafter, in all matter of increase of bank, always a mere gradual and imperceptible process. There is no heaping up at an instant, and while the eye rests upon the stream, of acres or rods on the <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>forming side of the river. No engineering skill is sufficient to say where the earth in the bank washed away and disintegrating into the river finds its resting and abiding place. The falling bank has passed into the floating mass of earth and water, and the particles of earth may rest one or fifty miles below, and upon either shore. There is, no matter how rapid the process of subtraction or addition, no detachment of earth from the-one .side and deposit of the same upon the other. The only thing which distinguishes this river from other streams, in the matter of accretion, is in the rapidity of the change, caused by the velocity of the current; and this in itself, in the very nature of things, works no change in the principle underlying the rule of law in respect thereto.</p>

The boundary, therefore, between Iowa and Nebraska is a varying line, so far as affected by these changes of diminution and accretion in the mere washing of the waters of the stream.”</p>
