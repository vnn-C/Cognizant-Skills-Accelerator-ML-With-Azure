The court erred in rendering a judgment for the plaintiff on the evidence introduced, because the instrument sued on by the plaintiff showed the conditions precedent to be performed by the plaintiff were, to “ withdraw all opposition to and forever renounce all claims to section 6, block 5, Houston <em>&amp; </em>Great Northern Railway school land in Pecos County, and withdraws all claims of whatsoever character to said land,” as well as to dismiss a suit then pending. And the plaintiff only proved that the suit had been dismissed, but did not prove by the introduction of any deed or release, or in any other way, the performance of any condition precedent, except the dismissal of the suit.
