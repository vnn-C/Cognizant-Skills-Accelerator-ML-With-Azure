Non est Factum — Denial of Partnership — Agency. — Action against the International &amp; Great Northern Railway Company for damages to horses shipped at San Antonio, Texas, for Hannibal, Missouri. It was alleged that the freight contract with the shipper had been made by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company as agent for the defendant company, and of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway, then operated by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and that it stipulated for limitation of liability beyond its own road. The injury was not incurred on the road of the defendant. The defendant denied under oath that a partnership existed between the said railway companies. It did not deny the execution of the contract. <em>Held, </em>that in such condition of the pleading the freight contract was relevant and admissible, although on its face it did not appear to have been executed by or for the defendant company.</p>

Joint Obligors.—Under the pleading and the contract admitted the several roads were liable as joint obligors, and it was not necessary to the liability of the defendant that it appear that it received the freight charges, or a part of the profits of the freight shipment.</p>

So far as the Missouri Pacific Railway Company is concerned, every line of road operated by it at the time it made such freight contract is to be regarded as a part of “the line of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company,” to which the liability was restricted. There being no denial of the execution by the defendant, it must be held as a joint obligor, and that the stipulated limitation did not end before the freight passed beyond the lines controlled by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, which made the contract.</p>
