In the latter part of February, 1890, there was to the credit of school community number 1 at least the sum of 8200, more than enough to pay the unpaid checks of plaintiff, but there was only about 815 to the credit of school number 1. The county treasurer at first refused to credit the funds of the community to the three schools as directed by the county judge, but afterwards did so—to school number 1 the sum of $240.96, to number 2, $652, and to school number 3, $300.80—and as the checks were presented against the fund of each school they were paid out of the fund <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>credited to it.
