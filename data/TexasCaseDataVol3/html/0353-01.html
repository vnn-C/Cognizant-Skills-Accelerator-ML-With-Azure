It seems-that Gf. W. Raines, W. H. Wellborn, and Z. J. Harmonson were the commissioners first appointed by the county judge to assess the damage in the condemnation proceedings, and they were duly sworn as such; but it is also made to appear from the undisputed evidence in the record that Well-born declined to serve, and the county judge appointed Gibbs in his place, who, with the other two commissioners first appointed, sat at the hearing and made the report. It also appears from the record that Gibbs was sworn prior to the meeting of the commissioners. The statute does not require either the appointment by the county judge of the commissioners nor their oath to be in writing, and the court therefore properly admitted paroi evidence to show that Gibbs was sworn. It seems that his appointment was in writing. 2 Sayles’ Civ. Stats., arts. 4183, 4184.

The bill of exceptions does not state the ground of the defendants’ objection to this judgment, but the court explains its reason for excluding it to be' the fact that the parties admitted that this judgment had been appealed from, and that the cause was then pending in the Supreme Court. Under our statute a judgment of a trial court is res adjudicata, notwithstanding the execution of a supersedeas bond and the pendency of the cause in the appellate court thereon. Thompson v.

Day, who recovered all the damage, had no title to the Wallace survey, and was not entitled to the damage caused thereto, but that this right was in the other defendants to this proceeding. If we could say from the record as presented to us, that these other defendants had been given legal notice of these proceedings, it might be that they would be-precluded by this judgment from denying Day’s right to all this damage, they not having excepted to or appealed from the judgment; but the record does not disclose such notice; and inasmuch as this is a special <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>proceeding, we are of opinion that before we should affirm Day’s right to damages which it appears he is not entitled to receive, we should know from the record as presented to us that appellant can suffer no injury, because those who are entitled to what Day receives are estopped by the proceedings from again asserting their claim against it.</p>

Where a judgment is by default, the record should contain the citation to the party against whom the default is taken, and a recital of service in the judgment is not sufficient. Burditt v.

Parker v. Railway, 84 Texas, 333. The proceedings for the condemnation of the right of way across the Wallace and Hallmark surveys having been consolidated in the County Court, and the verdict not showing the amount of damage caused to each survey, the error in excluding the judgment above indicated will necessitate a reversal of the entire judgment.</p>

We believe, however, it would be better if the court would instruct the jury that the measure of defendant’s damage is the fair value of the land actually taken, and the lessened value of the remainder of the tract, and admit evidence as to the several items alluded to in the charge as bearing upon such lessened value, without specially directing the attention of the jury thereto.</p>

A. Needham et al. v. E. S. Day, which was a suit to try the title to one of the tracts of land—the Wallace survey—through which appellant seeks to condemn the right of way for its railway.</p>

This proceeding and that to condemn the right of way over the Hallmark survey (in which E. S. Day was the sole defendant) were consolidated and tried together in the County Court, without objection; Day alone of the defendants having appeared before the commissioners and in the County Court to claim damages. While the record does not affirmatively show legal service on Needham and others, the report of the commissioners recites that all parties had due notice, judgment was entered against them in the County Court, the appeal bond was made payable to them as well as to Day, and appellant and appellee Day have treated them as parties to the proceedings throughout; appellant admitting, in its motion for new trial in the County Court and in its brief in this court, that they were made parties to the proceedings, and the question of their not being-parties is raised for the first time by this court. In this state of the record, it seems to me, appellant should not be heard to complain if we should treat them as parties to the condemnation proceedings and bound thereby.</p>
    <p id="b384-5" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[275,1277,1300,478]]]'>I am further of opinion, that it was the duty of appellant, if it desired protection against paying the damages twice, to see that they were properly before the court before proceeding to have the damages assessed. Day was in possession of the land, as alleged by appellant, and entitled to receive the damages, in the absence of other claimants. It is contrary to the very theory on which condemnation proceedings are founded, the scope of which is to show the necessity for the taking of land for public use and to assess the damages incident thereto, to permit the party condemning to dispute the title of him against whom the proceeding has been instituted.</p>
    <p id="b384-6" data-blocks='[["BL_384.6",384,[279,1775,1297,587]]]'>It results then, that if Day only had been a party defendant, appellant could not wholly dispute his title by introducing a judgment divesting him of all title, and at the same time maintain a proceeding against him founded upon the assumption of some title at least. If, on the other hand, Needham and others were made parties, as both appellant and appelle concede, it results that they are bound by the judgment of condemnation, and that it does not lie in the mouth of appellant to complain of the exclusion of evidence bearing alone upon the question of the disposition to be made of the damages; Needham and others not having complained, but acquiesced in the judgment awarding all the damages to appellee Day. It was immaterial to appellant who received the damages, just so all parties were bound by the judgment of condemnation.</p>
    <p id="b384-7" data-blocks='[["BL_384.7",384,[279,2373,1300,140]],["BL_385.1",385,[166,317,1300,292]]]'>Besides, it would seem there was no technical error even in excluding the judgment, if it be deemed final, as seems to be held by the majority, because there was no allegation of a final judgment, but only of pending <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>litigation. If we might take into consideration the fact, officially known to us, that this judgment has been reversed by this court, it would seem to be a useless thing to remand the cause for a new trial to admit evidence which the judgment of this court has already destroyed. In support of some of the views expressed above, see Lewis on Eminent Domain, paragraphs 426, 440, 441, 442.</p>
    <p id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[169,618,1299,338]]]'>My conclusion is, that we should not, as held by the majority, reverse the judgment and remand the cause for a new trial. The consolidation of the two condemnation proceedings, in one of which Day alone was interested, procured, or at least acquiesced in, by appellant, would seem to preclude it from having a modification of the decree so as to have the damages retained in court to abide the final determination of the suit to try the title to the land.</p>
