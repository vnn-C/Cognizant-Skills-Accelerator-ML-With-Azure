To a plea of outstanding title in one E., plaintiff replied that E. held the title as a mere naked trustee, and that the entire beneficial interest was in himself; and E. being thereafter joined as a coplaintiff, filed a plea adopting plaintiff’s prayer, and admitting all his allegations with reference to the character in which she held title. <em>Held, </em>that this was in effect a disclaimer by E. of all title and interest in the land, not less effectual than a deed of relinquishment, and the trial court erred in adjudging that the plea of outstanding title must prevail.</p>

    <p id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[170,520,1302,528]]]'>The defendants, among other matters, pleaded an outstanding title in one Elizabeth Strickland. In support of this plea they relied upon a deed, made before the institution of the suit, by Joseph Strickland and his wife to Elizabeth Strickland, for the recited consideration of $1500 paid. To this plea Joseph Strickland replied, that the deed to Elizabeth Strickland was executed without consideration; that she held as a mere naked trustee, and that the entire beneficial interest was in him. He prayed that she be made a party plaintiff in the suit. Accordingly, by leave of the court, Elizabeth appeared as a coplaintiff. She filed a plea in which she adopted the prayer of Joseph Strickland, admitting all his allegations with reference to the character in which she held.</p>
