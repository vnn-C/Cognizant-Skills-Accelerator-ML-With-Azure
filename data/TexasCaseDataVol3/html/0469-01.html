Case in Judgment—Sale by an Attorney in Fact—Recitals in Certificate of Acknowledgment.—In 1844, Hunt, the attorney in fact, who hacl a written power of attorney from one Palmer to convey land, sold and conveyed the land, reciting a paid consideration of $1000; but in the acknowledgment of the deed, which is in proper form, was this recital: “Provided, it is expressly understood and acknowledged by the said Charles S. Hunt, that the foregoing deed is given in consideration of eight land certificates for one league and labor of land each [giving a list of them], which certificates, as aforesaid, Charles S. Hunt sold to John D. Wilkins [thegrantee in the deed], which being passed by the Board of Land Commissioners for the county of Jasper, and on examination by the Board of Examining Commissioners, rejected, which circumstances render the validity of such claims doubtful, therefore this deed is given as indemnity to said John D. Wilkins.” This deed was recorded as early as 1850. Since 1846, Palmer nor his heirs have paid taxes on the land. He resided in Jasper County, where the land lies, until his death in 1850. In 1886, defendant bought the land from the heirs of Wilkins, paying full value for it, placed its deed on record, and paid taxes, and in 1889 took actual possession. Suit was filed by the heirs of Palmer to recover the land, in 1891. A judgment for defendant was affirmed.</p>

But the recitals are evidence against defendant that the recited fact existed. The deed comes from the custody of those claiming under it, and is one of the evidences of title; the acknowledgment was made use of as a means of recording the deed, and the recitals are not to be treated as the ex parte statements of Hunt and the officer, but are rather analogous to an assertion made by one person prejudicial to the interest of another, in his presence, and not denied.

    <p id="b498-9" data-blocks='[["BL_498.9",498,[259,1515,1300,578]]]'>The authority given to Hunt was to sell, and having sold, to convey. He had no rightful power to.convey without selling. The general terms are to be intended as used in aid of the specific power defined, and not as containing in themselves an enlargement of the scope of the authority. It is suggested in argument, that the land certificates which had been previously sold by Hunt to Wilkins probably belonged to Palmer, and that the obligation to indemnify Wilkins for their loss rested upon him, and that the conveyance was made in discharge of it. The language of the certificate does not suggest such a fact; and if it were admitted, it would not bring the conveyance within the terms of the power, though it might render the inference of a ratification by Palmer more readily admissible.</p>
    <p id="b498-10" data-blocks='[["BL_498.10",498,[259,2113,1298,88]]]'>A power to sell does not include a power to convey in discharge of a pre-existing obligation or liability of the constituent.</p>

Monroe v. Arledge, 23 Texas, 479. The acknowledgment itself was not an essential part of the deed. That instrument operated from the time of its delivery, whether acknowledged or not. It bears a date two days prior to the acknowledgment, and in the absence of evidence as to the time at which it was delivered, the weight of authority and of reason holds, and the presumption obtains, that delivery was made at the date of the instrument, rather than that of the acknowledgment. Dev. on Deeds, 178-181, 265. The deed, therefore, passed the title or was void, irrespective of the recitals of the acknowledgment. The acknowledgment, by its own force, can not have the effect of defeating or impairing the operation of •the deed. If the deed was void or voidable, it was because of the facts, and not through any efficacy given by law to the certificate of authentication. But the recital in the certificate is, we think, evidence against the defendant that the recited fact existed. It comes from the custody of those claiming under the deed on which it is endorsed, and together with which it is one of their evidences of title. The acknowledgment containing it was made use of as a means of recording the deed and of thus asserting title. These circumstances show that the deed was accepted with the acknowledgment upon it, and the latter is not therefore to be treated as the ex parte statement of Hunt and of the officer. It is analogous to an assertion made by one person prejudicial to the interest of another, in his presence, and assented to or not denied. It is therefore evidence, but not conclusive evidence, that the fact existed as stated. It could certainly have been rebutted by positive testimony that it was not true, and that Wilkins had in fact paid the consideration recited in the deed, for the use of Palmer; and it is equally true it could be rebutted by circumstances. For this reason it was proper to admit the deed in evidence and to determine its effect in the light of all the facts of the case. Thus considered, we can not say that the court below was bound to accept the recital in the certificate as furnishing a controlling reason for holding the deed to have been inoperative.</p>

Yet such a conveyance may be ratified and may support a title in a subsequent bona fide purchaser from the grantee in the deed of the attorney; and this illustrates that it is not true, in an absolute and unrestricted sense, that the deed is void. In the hands of the grantee of the attorney in fact, and of ail purchasers from him with notice of the fraud, it is void as against the constituent of the power, and may be so treated by him in an action of trespass or ejectment to recover the property, even in States where a recovery must be had in these actions upon the legal title.

But that case was not one of a naked power to sell, but was treated as belonging to the class of cases in which a trustee with power of sale indirectly purchases the trust property. Such trustees are usually invested with the legal title, .and can therefore convey it. In sales by executors, administrators, and guardians the legal title passes by the action of the court. In all of these cases, if the trustee has perpetrated a fraud, and through another person attempted to acquire the property, the holder of the legal title is charged as trustee, but must be reached by timely action. But an attorney in <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>fact with a bare power of sale is not clothed with any title to the property, nor with any power over it except such as the instrument confers.
