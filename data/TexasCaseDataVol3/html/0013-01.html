    <p id="b43-9" data-blocks='[["BL_43.10",43,[173,1522,1298,89]]]'>The record presents two questions for our determination. As formulated by plaintiff in error, they are:</p>
    <p id="b43-10" data-blocks='[["BL_43.11",43,[172,1622,1299,286]]]'>“ First. Did the failure of the plaintiff in error to reregister his deed to the land sued for within four years after the destruction by fire of the book containing the record of his deed, deprive him of the legal effect of the proper registration of that deed before the destruction of such record book ? And if such is held to be the effect of his failure to reregister his deed within four years after such destruction, then</p>
    <p id="b43-11" data-blocks='[["BL_43.12",43,[170,1919,1301,379]]]'>“Second. Did not sufficient of the record of his deed remain in the clerk’s office as served to identify it as a conveyance of the land by, and to exhibit a want of title in, the grantors of Davis to the land sued for ? Under the facts exhibited by the mutilated record of the deed, were not all subsequent purchasers from the grantors named therein put upon inquiry as to the true state of the title to the land, and chargeable with all the knowledge as to the state of the title that proper and prudent inquiry would have disclosed ? ’ ’</p>
    <p id="b43-12" data-blocks='[["BL_43.13",43,[171,2319,1299,137]]]'>1. The rule of law announced in the cases of Magee v. Merriman, 85 Texas, 105, and O’Neal v. Pettus, 79 Texas, 255, settles the first question adversely to the plaintiff in error.</p>
    <p id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[289,333,1302,238]]]'>
      <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>In construing the Act of 1876, these cases hold, that the destroyed record must be restored by rerecording the original within four years from the date of the destruction of the record in order to affect an otherwise innocent purchaser with notice. The facts show that this was not done before Moss acquired his title.</p>
    <p id="b44-5" data-blocks='[["BL_44.5",44,[288,584,1303,833]]]'>2. In reply to the second question, it may be said, that it is not contended that defendants in error and Davis actually knew of the existence of what is shown by the partially destroyed record, or knew of the registration of that instrument; but upon the contrary, it is apparent that they had no actual knowledge of this instrument or of the record of it, either before its destruction or after. But be this as it may, it is apparent to us that the record of this instrument as it existed after it was partially destroyed was not sufficient to put a subsequent purchaser upon notice of the adverse title of the plaintiff in error. In order for the record of an instrument permitted by law to be recorded to operate as constructive notice, it must be properly proven and acknowledged. And in determining the sufficiency of the instrument in this respect, as well as others,, it is to be tested by what appears from the face of the record. If the instrument, as disclosed by the record, is defective as a conveyance, or if the certificate of acknowledgment as there appears is not sufficient when tested by the law upon that subject, the record is evidence of the vice in the instrument, and it will not operate as constructive notice.</p>
    <p id="b44-6" data-blocks='[["BL_44.6",44,[286,1429,1304,1086]],["BL_45.1",45,[167,346,1305,437]]]'>The law upon this subject is well stated by Associate Justice Moore in the case of Taylor v. Harrison, 47 Texas, 456: “The record is accomplished by making such instruments, when duly proven and recorded as provided by the statute, operate as constructive notice to,creditors and subsequent purchasers of such facts as they would have learned from the record, if examined. But purchasers and creditors are only charged by construction with notice of the facts actually exhibited by the record, and not with such as might have been ascertained by such inquiries as an examination of the record might have induced a prudent man to make. Hence it is a well established rule, that the registration of deeds or instruments required by law to be recorded will not operate as constructive notice, unless they have been acknowledged or proved as prescribed by law.

And while it is a conclusion of law which can not be disputed, that subsequent purchasers and creditors are charged with notice of all the facts shown or exhibited by the record, it has never been held that they were bound or affected by a record which does not give notice of a valid conveyance of the property in question, but merely gives information which, if in fact communicated to such creditor or purchaser, might have been reasonably sufficient to put him upon inquiry, though had such inquiry been made, the existence of a prior encumbrance, not' properly recorded, might have been ascertained. It is <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>therefore held, that a deed not properly acknowledged or proved for record, although in fact duly executed, will not operate as notice of such deed; and though it may have been duly proved or acknowledged for record, if in some material respect it has been improperly recorded, the same result follows from such omission, and the record will only give notice of the existence of such an instrument as that exhibited by it.

At the time the deed under which the plaintiff claimed the land in controversy in this case was registered, the statute required that the acknowledgment or proof of the execution of the instrument to be recorded should be certified by the officer before whom it is taken or made upon such instrument, and that such certificate should become a part of the record. The deed which has given-rise to this, as registered, does not purport to have upon it this certificate. And-though a certificate, as prescribed by the statute, was in fact-endorsed upon the deed, this essential portion of its proper registration was entirely omitted. The deed, therefore, was not properly recorded, and creditors and subsequent purchasers are not chargeable with notice of it by reason of such defective record.”</p>
