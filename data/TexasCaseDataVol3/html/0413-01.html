The obligation of appellees was an independent guaranty, intended to cover future transactions. They obligated themselves that they would guarantee that said J. A. Anderson would faithfully perform all of his obligations named in his contract with appellant, “ in accordance with the terms, intent, and spirit of said contract.” One of the terms of said contract was, that “settlement for beer, ice, and. rent shall be made at the end of each month, but that remittances shall be made weekly,” and “ no account shall run over one month.” On the. failure of said J. A. Anderson to settle at the end of the first month, appellees were entitled to notice of his default, to the end that they might, protect themselves against loss; and the fact that Anderson was insolvent would not relieve appellant from its obligation to give appellees notice of such default. Appellees were entitled to stand on the terms of the contract, the performance of which they had guaranteed. Mayfield v. Wheeler, 37 Texas, 259; Douglass v.

    <p id="b441-10" data-blocks='[["BL_441.11",441,[182,921,1296,136]]]'>The contract, among other things, stipulated that settlement for beer and ice should be made at the end of each month, but the contract was to be and remain in full force and effect until mutually abandoned.</p>

    <p id="b441-12" data-blocks='[["BL_441.13",441,[182,1321,1296,137]]]'>Appellees excepted to plaintiff’s petition specially, because the same showed that J. A. Anderson made default at the end of the first month, and that appellees were not notified of such default.</p>

A. Anderson which accrued prior to July 5, 1889, the time when his contract with appellant and the contract of guaranty were executed, nor upon any item accruing subsequent to August 5, 1889.</p>
    <p id="b441-16" data-blocks='[["BL_441.17",441,[187,2116,1302,227]]]'>The first of these rulings was correct. The contract between appellant and J. A. Anderson, and to which the contract of guaranty relates, does not bind the latter to pay any pre-existing indebtedness, and appellees only guaranteed the performance by J. A. Anderson of the obligations “named in the contract.”</p>

It is charged in appellant’s pleadings, that J. A. Anderson was hopelessly and notoriously insolvent at the time of the execution of the contract of guaranty, and has so continued ever since, and that this fact was known to appellees. If these averments be true, notice of default was unnecessary. Wade on Notice, 2 ed., sec. 426; 9 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 80; Brandt on Sure, and Guar., sec. 202.</p>
