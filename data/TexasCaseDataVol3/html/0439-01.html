Purchaser sold the land with general warranty. The defendant in execution brought suit for the land. The defendant vouched his warrantor, who in defense set up his judgment against the plaintiff, under which the land had been sold; asking relief in case the sheriff sale should be held invalid. The plaintiff was a nonresident, and appears to have been such at the rendition of the judgment under which the land was sold. <em>Held, </em>that exceptions to this answer were properly sustained.</p>

This being in effect a suit for the ownership of land between Harrell, the creditor, and Burtis, the debtor, brought by the latter, a nonresident of Texas, in a forum of that State, Harrell, under the liberal system of procedure and pleading in this State, would be permitted in this suit to set up and enforce any equitable or legal claim or right he might have on the premises, in dispute. In other words, in this action he would be entitled to set up his debt, and in case title was vested in Burtis, inasmuch as he is a nonresident of Texas, have the land subjected to the payment of the debt.

So in this case, the judgment of the District Court of Atascosa County in favor of Harrell against Burtis, can not in this action be contradicted by other parts of the record, and said judgment is conclusive.

To sustain his cross-bill under equity practice, he must show that the matters therein set out grew out of the matter involved in the original bill, or were directly connected therewith; to sustain it under the statute, he must show that the counter-claim was founded on a cause of action arising out of, incident to, or connected with the demand upon which the plaintiff sues.

The latter impleaded on his warranty Joseph Harrell, who is now coappellant<a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>Appellee recovered the land in the District Court, and McCarthy obtained judgment against Harrell on his warranty.</p>
    <p id="b468-3" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[274,432,1302,734]]]'>1. There was no error in the ruling of the court sustaining appellee’s •exceptions to that part of appellant Harrell’s answer wherein he sought a recovery against appellee for an alleged debt. This claim was in nowise connected with or incidental to the subject matter of this suit; and the mere fact of appellee being a nonresident of the State affords no sufficient reason for departing from the well settled rules which will not allow Harrell to litigate his claim of debt in this case. It is not alleged that appellee is insolvent, or that there is any danger of Harrell losing his debt if his claim is not adjudicated in this suit; and the courts of the State of New York, in which appellee resides, are open to Harrell, and we must presume that they will, if applied to, afford him all the redress he may be entitled to. Besides, by an attachment suit, which is a proceeding in rem, he can sue appellee in the courts of this State and subject whatever interest he may have in the land in controversy to the payment of any just debt, certain in amount, that he may have against him.</p>

To defeat his right to it, appellants offered in evidence a certified copy of a judgment rendered by the District Court of Atascosa County in favor of appellant Joseph Harrell against appellee for $1317.40, on the 15tli day of October, 1875; regular execution sale of this land under an execution issued on said judgment; deed from the purchaser at said sale to Harrell, and from the latter to appellant McCarthy. Appellee attacked said judgment, claiming that it was void, because there was no valid service of citation on him; the citation being served, as he contends, only by publication. To sustain this contention, appellee tendered in evidence alleged certified copies of the following papers in said cause, viz.:</p>
    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.6",468,[273,1777,1301,430]]]'>The plaintiff’s original petition, in which it is alleged that the defendant therein, N. W.
