In this suit the firm of Cowan <em>&amp; </em>Posey were attorneys for the plaintiffs, the Posey of said firm being the justice of the peace who afterward rendered judgment against appellant as garnishee. At that-time A. S. Hill was justice of the peace, and issued the garnishment. Posey was not a regular licensed attorney, but was engaged in the business of a land agent, he and his partner, Cowan, who was a lawyer, agreeing to pool their earnings and divide them equally, Cowan to attend to the law business, and Posey the land agency.

      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.—The court below treated the judgment rendered by Posey in favor of Lippett, Leake <em>&amp; </em>Co. against appellant as garnishee as-being void. In this we think there was no error. Posey was interested equally with Cowan in the fee to be earned by the firm in this case, whether he was a licensed attorney or not. We know of nothing that could affect the legality of the agreement made between him and his partner, Cowan, to divide their respective earnings in the manner set forth in the conclusions of fact, and we think this would constitute such an interest in him as would disqualify him as judge from trying the case. The jury found that he was pecuniarily interested therein. Ilodde v. Susan, 58 Texas, 389. We also think he was disqualified by reason of his being a surety on the bond of the plaintiff to obtain the garnishment. In Hodde v. Susan, supra, it was held that a justice related to a surety on a claim bond was disqualified. It has also several times been held that a surety upon a cost bond was disqualified as a witness, by reason of his interest in the result of the suit, from testifying in the case. Bennett v. Dowling, 22 Texas, 660; Drake v. Brander, 8 Texas, 351; Gould v. Beal, 26 Texas, 665; Freeman v. Perry, 25 Texas, 611. The similarity of the reasons which disqualify a judge and a witness upon the ground of interest in the result of the suit was recognized in Simpson v. Brotherton, 62 Texas, 107. Appellees’ cross-assignments of Arror must therefore be held to be. not well taken.</p>
    <p id="b344-7" data-blocks='[["BL_344.7",344,[264,2207,1306,287]],["BL_345.1",345,[156,322,1299,128]]]'>We understand from the record and briefs of the parties, that the court below held the order entered by Germany as county judge, transferring the cause of Neblett <em>&amp; </em>Arnold v. Franco-Texan Land Company to the District Court, to be invalid; but we are not clear upon what ground this ruling was based. It seems that the court below also sustained the order entered by Germany’s successor, setting aside this order of transfer. If. <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>the court below was oí opinion that the order entered by Germany was a nullity because it does not state the ground of his disqualification, we think it erred.</p>
    <p id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.5",345,[153,471,1302,687]]]'>In the case of Bates v. Casey <em>&amp; </em>Swasey, 61 Texas, 592, it is said: <em>“ </em>This cause was transferred from the County to the District Court because the county judge was disqualified to hear and determine it. The grounds of his disqualification are not stated, nor do we think it necessary that they should be when he recuses himself, unless they are questioned before the cause reaches this court. If a party wishes to dispute the fact that a county judge is disqualified, he can by calling it in question, either in the District or County Court, have the grounds of the supposed disqualification set forth and established. Any improper ruling upon the subject could then be revised by appeal to this court, by bringing it to our attention, as in case of other errors; but where no such question is made below, and the record shows, as in this case, that the judge transferred the cause because of his disqualification, the conclusive presumption will be in favor of his ruling and of the jurisdiction of the District Court.”</p>
    <p id="b345-6" data-blocks='[["BL_345.6",345,[152,1169,1299,285]]]'>In this case the record shows, that the court sustained the motion of the defendant, which very clearly set forth the ground of the disqualification of the county judge relied upon, and we are of opinion that the order transferring the case was sufficient. We do not find anything in the case of Poole v. Mueller Brothers Furniture and Carpet Company, 80 Texas, 189, which conflicts with this conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b345-7" data-blocks='[["BL_345.7",345,[151,1467,1301,734]]]'>We are also of opinion that the facts set forth in the motion upon which this order was made, and also the facts disclosed by the record sustaining the allegations of this motion, show that Germany was in fact disqualified to try that case, and that the order of transfer was correctly made. It seems that Germany, as receiver of the firm of Neblett <em>&amp; </em>Arnold, was, in effect, plaintiff in that case. It is- true, his appointment having been made after the institution of the suit, it was not necessary for his name to be substituted as plaintiff upon the record (Lee v. Salinas, 15 Texas, 495); but whatever recovery might be had would be paid to him, and not to them. It was therefore his suit, in effect; and while we have been referred to no decision which directly holds that a judge is disqualified from rendering a judgment in his favor as receiver, we have no doubt that such is the law. That an administrator could not render such judgment, we think has never been questioned, and we see no difference in principle between the cases.</p>

Smith Bros. v. Hardin, 68 Texas, 120; Cleveland v. Tufts, 69 Texas, 580; Railway v. Kerfoot, 3 Willson’s C. C., 452; 1 W. &amp; W. C. C., 527. We believe that the failure of the county clerk to perform his duty by striking the case from the docket of his court and transmitting the papers to the District Court,could not have the effect to retain jurisdiction after the entry of the order of transfer.</p>
    <p id="b346-5" data-blocks='[["BL_346.5",346,[284,676,1297,238]]]'>We are therefore of opinion, that the court below erred in holding either of the judgments under which appellees claim to be valid, and in rendering judgment in their favor, and that its judgment should therefore be reversed, and judgment here rendered in favor of appellant for the land in controversy, with costs; and it is so ordered.</p>
