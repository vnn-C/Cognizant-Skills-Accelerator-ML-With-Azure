In 1888 the widow and other heirs brought suit for the land which had been secured under the certificate, against remote vendees. <em>Held, </em>that it devolved upon the defendants to prove compliance with the terms of the sale; no such proof being made, the plaintiffs, having the legal title, were entitled to recover, the defendants not showing any equity; the lapse of time did not affect the rights of the plaintiffs to recover.</p>
