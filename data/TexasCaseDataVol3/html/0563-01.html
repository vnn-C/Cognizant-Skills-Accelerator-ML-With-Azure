It will be seen from the conclusions of fact, that had appellant prevailed in the court below, he would have obtained the 60 acres of land claimed by him without it ever having been paid for as agreed by his vendor, Little, at the time of his purchase, and appellee, Andrews, would have acquired nothing as to this land by reason of his purchase at the sale under the judgment procured by Kuteman on the $690 note originally given by Key and Plumlee to Stults, and which had been paid by Plumlee. This suit was instituted to foreclose the lien reserved in the deed from Key to Little, in which the latter agreed to pay to Stults the amount due him from Key, appellee, Andrews, having become the owner of this claim; and the fact that Kuteman recovered a judgment upon another and unfounded claim against Key and Plumlee, and realized at a sale thereunder a sufficient sum from appellee, Andrews, to.have discharged Little’s debt, if applied thereto, can not enure to the benefit of Little nor to those claiming under him. Little was not a party to that suit, and the fact that Kuteman was not entitled to the money thus obtained does not entitle Little to it. If Kuteman had no right to the money, neither did Little; and if there is any way consistent with legal principle for appellee to get it back from the parties who ought to pay it, he should be allowed to do so. Until this proceeding, suit was never instituted upon the claim that Little agreed to pay to Stults as a part of the consideration of the conveyance from Key, and after appellee purchased at the sales under the Kuteman judgment, the latter, who held this claim, transferred it to him. The court below held, that this claim was only of equal dignity with the $85 note given by Little to Key and transferred to Jackson, and this view is probably sustained by expressions in the opinion of our Supreme Court when a branch of this case was <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>on a former appeal before it. Andrews v. Key, 77 Texas, 35. We are-not prepared to approve this conclusion in its entirety. The note which Little assumed to pay to Stults was a prior lien to any which could be created in the conveyance from Key to Little. It was the original purchase money that Key had agreed to pay Stults at the time of his purchase, and it would seem, upon principles of equity, that it should have had priority over the $85 note, which in one sense may be treated as the profit Key had made upon the transaction; but as to this we express no authoritative opinion, as the error, if any, was to the prejudice of appellee, and he does not complain.</p>
