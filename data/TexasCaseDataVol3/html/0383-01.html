We may, for the purpose of the disposition of this appeal, assume that the contract of shipment was a through contract, and that the liability of appellant only extended to acts occurring on its own line of road. But still it would not necessarily be a reversible error if the trial court differently construed the contract and held that the liability of appellant extended to the entire route. If it was indisputably shown from the evidence that the appellant converted the goods delivered to it as a carrier, or that the loss occurred on its own line, it would unquestionably be liable. Under such circumstances, the construction placed upon the contract by the trial court, although erroneous, would be regarded only as error in the abstract, which in itself would be harmless. In the absence of a statement of facts, we will assume that facts were proven upon the trial that subjected the appellant to liability in all events.</p>
