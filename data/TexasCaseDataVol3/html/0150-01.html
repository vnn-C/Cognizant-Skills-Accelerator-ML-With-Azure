Practice on Appeal — Citation in Error may be Sued Out, When.—R. recovered judgment in the District Court against the bank of M., December 4, 1889. On February 25, 1890, the defendant bank, as plaintiff in error, filed its petition and bond for a writ of error, and had citation issued, and on May 3, 1890, filed transcript of the record in the Supreme Court, and submitted the case on brief at that term. June 7,1892, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded the cause, but on June 25,1892, sustained a motion for rehearing, vacated the judgment previously entered by it, and struck the cause from the docket, because the transcript failed to show that the citation in error had ever been served. June 20, 1892, plaintiff in error had an alias citation issued and served, and again filed the transcript in the Supreme Court, September 30,1892. <em>Held, </em>on motion to dismiss the writ of error, because plaintiff had permitted over two years to elapse after filing its petition and bond before having defendant cited, and because three terms of the Supreme Court had passed after the filing of the petition before it had caused citation to be served on defendant, that as it appeared from the record that the attorney of the plaintiff in error believed, and had reason to believe, that the original citation in error had been duly served, and as the judgment in favor of the defendant in error was suspended by good and sufficient supersedeas bond, and no injury likely to result from the delay, there had been no such inexcusable neglect in prosecuting the writ of error as would justify the appellate court in sustaining the motion to dismiss.</p>

Garnishment Against Bank—Answer of Garnishee.—In a garnishment proceeding against a bank, the garnishee, by its cashier, answered, that when the writ was served it owed the judgment debtor nothing, but on the contrary he owed the bank $2000, which he still owes; that the judgment debtor when the writ was served owned sixty shares of the stock of the bank, but that such stock was then, and still is. hypothecated to a third person for its full value, and that the judgment debtor has no interest in the bank, nor had at the time the writ was served, except the bank stock above mentioned. <em>Held, </em>that though the answer did notin those exact words state that the bank was not indebted to the judgment debtor, nor that he did not own shares of stock therein at the time of the answer, yet no other inference can be fairly drawn from the answer, and it did substantially negative such indebtedness and ownership.</p>

This motion, with the transcript, having been transferred to this court, has been submitted for our determination, in connection with the answer of plaintiff in error to the motion and upon affidavits relating to the diligence or negligence of plaintiff in error, and especially on the issue as to whether the original citation in error was ever served.</p>

We further conclude, that plaintiff in error, the First National Bank of Montague, Texas, -relied solely upon its attorney to take the necessary steps to prosecute its writ of error, and that this attorney was under the erroneous impression, when he filed and submitted the record in the Supreme Court and thereafter until the case was decided by the Supreme Court, that the original citation in error had been served. We are also of opinion, that he probably at the time had good reason to believe that the citation had been served; but that owing to the lapse of time intervening and the loss of the original papers in said cause, he has been unable to show the particular facts or circumstances which probably misled him.</p>

We find, that neither plaintiff in error nor its attorney has been guilty of any intentional neglect in prosecuting the writ of error, but that the delay has resulted from a mistake of fact on the part of counsel for- plaintiff in error.

We know of no statute which requires us to dismiss this writ of error. We conclude, under the foregoing findings of fact, that the plaintiff in error has not been guilty of any such inexcusable neglect to prosecute this writ of error as would justify us in denying it a hearing upon this record, especially in view of the fact that it is brought conspicuously to our notice that the highest judicial tribunal in this State has already (under a mistake of fact) reviewed the record, and declared by their judgment that defendant in error is not entitled, by virtue of the judgment below, to recover of plaintiff in error the sum of money which, by this proceeding, it seeks to avoid paying. Certainly this decision of the Supreme Court justifies the inference, that the writ of error which plaintiff seeks to prosecute is not without merit; and we think that the rights of defendant in error will not be prejudiced by overruling this motion. In equity, relief will sometimes be granted against a mistake caused by the want of ordinary care, if the other person is not prejudiced thereby. <em>2 </em>Pome, Eq., 856.</p>

A. Morris, the cashier of said First National Bank of Montague, Texas, before you to answer upon oath,” etc. This commission having come into the hands of W. A. Williams, clerk of the County Court of Montague County, he duly made return, that on the 20th day of November, 1889, W. A. Morris, the witness before named, appeared before him and made answer as set forth therein. These answers are headed, “Answers of W. A. Morris,” and among other things say, “(1) that on the said 28th day of January, 1889, or when the said writ of garnishment was served on him as cashier of the First National Bank of Montague, Texas, the said bank owed said A. L. Matlock nothing; on the other hand, said A. L. Matlock owed the bank over $2000, with accrued interest, which amount he still owes said bank; * * * (3) the said A. L.

V. Farwell <em>&amp; </em>Co., to secure the payment to them of a note of $6000, and that said bank stock is still hypothecated to said J. V. Farwell &amp; Co. to secure them the payment of said $6000; (4) that said A. L.

L. Matlock, at the time of the taking of its deposition; also had failed to answer what number of shares said defendant Matlock had in said bank at the time of said answer. These exceptions do not seem to have been signed either by defendant in error or his counsel.

Hemming v. Zimin erschitte, 4 Texas, 159; Boren v. Billington, 82 Texas, 137. This objection, however, does not seem to have been raised in the court below; and treating it as having been waived, we are of opinion that the court <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>erred in holding the exceptions well taken. It is true the answer of the garnishee does not, in those exact words, state that the bank was not in-indebted to Matlock, nor that he did not own shares of stock therein at the time the answers were taken to the interrogatories; but we believe that no other inference can be fairly drawn, from the answers as made, and that they did substantially negative such indebtedness and ownership.

    <p id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[122,690,1301,378]]]'>The answer states that at the time of the service of the writ of garnishment the bank owed Matlock nothing, but on the contrary he owed it 82000, which he still owes; also, that he had no interest in the bank other than the sixty shares of stock hypothecated to Farwell <em>&amp; </em>Co. No attempt was made to subject these shares to sale as required by the statute, but a personal judgment was rendered against the bank for the full amount of the judgment in favor of defendant in error against Matlock, as upon a total failure to answer.</p>

Jemison v. Scarborough, 56 Texas, 358. The failure to make more specific answers seems to us to be attributable more to the neglect of the officer in reducing them to writing than to any desire on the part of the garnishee to evade answering.</p>
    <p id="b181-7" data-blocks='[["BL_181.7",181,[123,1487,1300,732]]]'>Again: it will be noted that the commission under which the answer to the garnishee was taken required the officer to whom it was directed to take the answers of W.

It has several times been decided in this State, that such service will not sustain a judgment by default against a corporation, and it may well be doubted whether the answers of Morris under this commission would confer jurisdiction upon the court to render a judgment by default (for a judgment "for failure to make full answer would seem to be a judgment by default) against the bank; but as this question is not raised in the assignments of error, and as there are expressions in some of the decisions which might seem to give weight to such an answer as between the parties to this proceeding, we will not undertake its decision.
