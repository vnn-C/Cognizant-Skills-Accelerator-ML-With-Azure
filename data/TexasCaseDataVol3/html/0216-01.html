    <p id="b244-5" data-blocks='[["BL_244.5",244,[286,530,1299,487]]]'>Opinion.—1. Although the field notes of the survey made under the pre-emption which forms the basis of appellee’s title were not returned to the General Land Office within twelve months after the date of the survey, as required by law, still, as they were returned before appellant acquired any right to the land, upon the authority of Gammage v. Powell, 61 Texas, 629, and McCarthy v. Gomez, 85 Texas, 10, it must be held that the pre-emption right under which appellee claims has not been forfeited, and that it is superior to appellant’s attempted pre-emption of the land. The principle upon which a similar question is decided in those cases applies with equal force in this case.</p>
    <p id="b244-6" data-blocks='[["BL_244.6",244,[284,1030,1299,227]]]'>2. In Palmer v.

    <p id="b244-8" data-blocks='[["BL_244.7",244,[283,1278,1299,239]]]'>In that case, the appellant resisted the enforcement of a vendor’s lien on the land, because when he purchased it, it was an unpatented preemption, and had not been occupied three years. The Supreme Court held, that a vendor’s lien existed on the land to secure the payment of a note given for part of the purchase money.</p>
    <p id="b244-9" data-blocks='[["BL_244.8",244,[280,1529,1302,286]]]'>In the present case, Trammell sold the land to Hewlett, and retained in the deed an express lien to secure the deferred payment of purchase money. Appellee, the legal holder of the note thus secured, sued Hewlett, and obtained a judgment on the note and a foreclosure of the lien ■on the land; and at a sale made under an order of sale issued on said judgment, he became the purchaser of the land.</p>
    <p id="b244-10" data-blocks='[["BL_244.9",244,[279,1827,1301,237]]]'>Under these circumstances, we think the doctrine announced in Palmer v. Bennett, supra, has application, and it must be held, that the foreclosure sale vested in appellee all the rights which the three occupants, Cabler, Trammell, and Hewlett, or either of them, had in the land at the time of said sale by virtue of the Cabler pre-emption.</p>
