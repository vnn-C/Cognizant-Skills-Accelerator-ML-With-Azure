On May 2, 1890, Congress passed an act adopting certain chapters of Mansfield’s Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas as the law in force in the Indian Territory, among which was chapter 8, relating to assignments for the benefit of creditors, and chapter 110, relating to mortgages. Mr. Greenleaf, in the first volume of his work on Evidence, section 490, says: “ Reciprocal relations between the National Government and the several States comprising the United States are not foreign, but domestic. Hence the courts of the United States take judicial notice of all the public laws of the respective States whenever they are called upon to consider and apply them. And, in like manner, the courts of the several States take judicial notice of all public acts of Congress, including those which relate exclusively to the District of Columbia, without any formal proof. But private statutes must be proved in the ordinary mode.” Also, see 1 Whart. on Ev., 287; 1 Rice on Ev., 32.</p>
    <p id="b531-5" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[170,1118,1301,388]]]'>. By an act of Congress, passed February 27, 1801, it was declared, that “ the laws of the State of Virginia as they now exist shall be and continue in force in that part of the District of Columbia which was ceded by the said State to the United States, and by them accepted for the permanent seat of government; and that the laws of the State of Maryland as they now exist shall be and continue in force in that part of said District which wq,s ceded by that State to the United States, and by them accepted as aforesaid.” Bright.

That this instrument, as to its nature, validity, construction, and effect, is to be governed by the laws of the Indian Territory, where it was executed, and where the property <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>■conveyed thereby was situated, is not seriously questioned. Jones on Chat. Mort., 299. The test in Arkansas as to whether an instument is an assignment or a mortgage seems to be, was it the intention of the grantor to set aside the property absolutely as a fund to be used in paying the debt; or was it only his intention to secure the debt by a lien thereon, reserving the right to discharge the debt out of other funds and release the lien ? In the first case, it would be an assignment; in the second, a mortgage. Richmond v. Miss.
