Puckett died intestate, indebted to plaintiffs as alleged in their petition, and said indebtedness was secured by deed of trust, conveying the real estate described in plaintiffs’ petition to S. C. Upshaw, the proper way to foreclose the lien was by administration through the Probate Court; and the fact that defendants had taken possession gf the real estate, when it was not shown that they had wasted or destroyed the property, did not release plaintiffs of the necessity of proceeding through the Probate Court, and did not entitle them to sue in the District Court, especially when it was not shown that theirs was not the only debt.

      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.—No administration upon the estate of E. G. Puckett was necessary. The only relief sought by appellees was the foreclosure of their mortgage upon land, the entire interest in which had passed out of Puckett prior to his death. No judgment was sought against his estate for any balance that might remain after subjecting the land; he did not leave sufficient property to justify administration thereon; his administrator, if he had one, would have no interest in this controversy, whether the deed to E. C. Puckett or the mortgage of appellees be adjudged to have priority. In such case no useful purpose could be subserved bjr requiring costs to be incurred in making parties who have no interest to be affected by the litigation. This question has been so exhaustively and satisfactorily treated in the case of Heard v. McKinney, 1 Posey’s Unreported Cases, 83, that we shall not undertake to add anything to what is there said. Also, see Jones v. Smith, <em>55 </em>Texas, 383; Patterson v. Allen, 50 Texas, 23.</p>
    <p id="b378-6" data-blocks='[["BL_378.6",378,[288,1520,1300,484]]]'>The court below found that Porter was not charged with notice of the prior deed to E. C. Puckett at the time he took the mortgage, and appellants challenge the correctness of this finding, upon the ground that the grantee in such deed was in actual possession at this time. It is true, E. C. Puckett and her husband were living upon the land, but the common grantor, E. G. Puckett, was also living upon it with them, and the records showed the title to be in him. For possession alone to be notice of an unrecorded deed, it must be exclusive as against the grantor, or the right of possession will be referred to the recorded title. Wade on Notice, 290; Smith v.
