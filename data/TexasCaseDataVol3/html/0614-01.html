Hamner then wrote to-Judge Walker that a part of the land had been sold for taxes, expressing the opinion that his (Walker’s) deeds were not properly recorded; to-which Walker replied, requesting Hamner to send him an abstract of the title. Hamner made and sent the abstract as requested. In making the abstract he found on the deed records of Haskell County the several deeds introduced in evidence by plaintiff on the trial of this case, showing the date of their filing and recording, all of which he put in the abstract. For this service he charged Judge Walker $7.50, but Walker sent him only $5, and this he says offended him. A few days after this, the clerk of the County Court of Haskell County handed him a letter from M. D. Herring, the defendant, asking if Lewis and Ransom Moore had any land subject to execution in his county. Hamner immediately wrote Herring, that if he would send him an execution against the Moores, he (Hamner) could find property to levy it on; and in reply Herring sent him the execution that was levied on the land. Hamner acted as agent of defendant,. Captain Herring, placed the execution in the hands of the sheriff, with instructions to levy it on the land, wrote out the levy and return for the sheriff, and bought in the land at the sale for Captain Herring. Hamner knew of Walker’s claim to the land and the condition of his title at the time he had the levy made, and when he bought in the land for Captain Herring; the knowledge acquired as stated in making the abstract for Walker.</p>

      <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>“ I drafted the deed of trust from Lewis and Ransom Moore to George Clark and J. L. Dyer. After the execution of said deed of trust, and prior to the defendant, Herring, buying the note against the Moores on which he obtained judgment, I had a conversation regarding the indebtedness of Lewis and Ransom Moore and the execution of said deed of trust. Herring came to my office and inquired about the matter, and I got out the papers, and Herring seemed to know all about the deed of trust. My recollection is, that I showed defendant said deed of trust, but of this I am not positive. We were discussing principally the value of the Grayson County land, and my recollection is, that the other lands mentioned in the deed of trust were also spoken of, but I can not say positively that any mention was made of the Haskell County land, though I think there, was. Captain Herring said he knew all about the Grayson County land, and was of the opinion that it could be sold for enough to pay off all the indebtedness secured by the deed of trust and that of defendant also. The reason I do not recollect positively as to any mention of the land in Haskell County being talked about between us, is because Captain Herring thought at the time that the Grayson County land was amply sufficient in value to pay the indebtedness secured by the deed of trust and his claim also.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[157,1312,1303,1083]]]'>Upon the same subject Captain Herring testified as follows: “ I have never seen this deed of trust [the one referred to in the statement of facts and by George Clark] before this moment; I am positive Judge Clark never showed me the same at any time, nor have I ever seen it until now. I never knew that either Lewis Moore or Ransom Moore had any land in Haskell County until about March, 1889, when my attorney, Ed. J. Hamner, wrote me to send him an execution. In the conversation referred to by George Clark no mention whatever was made of the Haskell County land, as both he and I were of the opinion the Grayson County land would bring enough to pay off the Moore indebtedness. Sometime after the sale of the Grayson County land to the bank, John Norris was leaving here to go out into Haskell County, and I requested him to find out if the Moores had any lands out there, as I had learned from some source which I do not now recollect that the Moores had some land in that section of the country, but in what county I did not know; and not until after the levy of the execution in this case did I know of this Haskell County land, as John Norris wrote me he could not find any land belonging to the Moores in that country. I did go to Grayson County and looked at the land there, but I never examined the records there, nor did I know of any deed of trust being recorded there. I did not have the land there sold, because I found that Clark <em>&amp; </em>Dyer had already sold it to the bank. I had an abstract of my judgment recorded there.”</p>
