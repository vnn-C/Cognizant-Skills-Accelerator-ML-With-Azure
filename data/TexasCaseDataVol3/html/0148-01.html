Less than three hours before that time the track over the bridge was clear of obstruction. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence did not show defendants to have been guilty of negligence; and also, that the accident was within the assumed risks of plaintiff’s employment.</p>

His engine was derailed about 11 o’clock at night, in the Indian Territory, by coming in contact with a cow fastened in a railroad bridge, with her legs down between the ties. Less than three hours before that time, the track over the bridge was clear of obstructions. Our conclusion from the undisputed facts is, (1) that the evidence failed to show that the appellees were guilty of negligence in the discharge of their duty to appellant as one of their employes; and (2) that the injury which appellant received was the result of an accident which he must be held to have contemplated as within the assumed risks of becoming an engineer for appellees. In other words, we are of opinion that the jury could not properly have found a verdict for appellant, and that therefore, if there was error in the charge, as as<a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>signed, it would not require a reversal of the judgment.
