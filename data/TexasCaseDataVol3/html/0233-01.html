Watson answered, that he paid his debt due plaintiff on the 4th of October, 1889; and the defendant Kahler and the Middlesex Banking Company answered, that at the request of John Watson said company had paid the notes sued on.

Sims, it seems, was not interested with Wright in the land and loan agency of the latter, and was ignorant of the fact that Wright was doing all his correspondence in relation to this business in the name of the firm of Sims <em>&amp; </em>Wright.

Payments of interest on loans in Red River County were frequently remitted to plaintiff through Sims <em>&amp; </em>Wright, though payments of interest were sometimes made through others, and receipts were given by plaintiff to any one who remitted interest to it.</p>

Levi further testified, that plaintiff had no agents save the officers of the company, who all resided in the city of Galveston. That his first knowledge of Sims <em>&amp; </em>Wright, or Wright, was through a letter written to him from Clarksville, Texas, in the name of Sims &amp; Wright, requesting the plaintiff to appoint them its agent for Red River County; and in reply to this letter Levi wrote, informing them that plaintiff did not employ agents, its only agents were its officers; and in his letter he enclosed a circular of the plaintiff’s, explaining the terms and considerations upon which loans of money were made by it, and containing the form of an application for a loan.</p>

The law office of Sim &amp; Wright and the land and loan office of Wright were in different buildings at the time the plaintiff sent the note of defendant Watson, and the deed in trust from him to Levi, to Sims <em>&amp; </em>Wright, in September, 1889. Prior to this the manager for the plaintiff company had informed himself as to the character and standing of this law firm, and had found that its character and standing was high.

L. Sims, J. H. Bryson, J. W. Dunn, J. B. Rose, G. C. Foster, and A. B. Fally, with the exhibits and letters attached to the depositions of said witnesses. The objection urged to the admission of this evidence, that there is no plea of estoppel on the part of defendant, need not be considered or decided, since there is no estoppel in the case, and the evidence is not admissible for such purpose, because it plainly appears that the correspondence between plaintiff and Sims <em>&amp; </em>Wright, or Wright, did not influence the conduct of either of the defendants in their dealings with Wright. Such correspondence was not lmown to either of them, so far as the evidence discloses, at the time they paid to Wright the notes due from Watson to plaintiff. Watson expressly declares that he had no knowledge of any dealings between plaintiff and others than himself in Red River County, whether had through Wright or others; and we can not infer the other defendant, before advancing the money for the payment of this note, was made acquainted with the correspondence of plaintiff and Wright as to matters in which defendant had no interest. It is certainly not shown that the defendant the Middlesex Banking Company had any knowledge of transactions had between plaintiff and others in Red River County, <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>other than defendant Watson; and until such proof is made, none of the evidence objected to under these assignments is admissible for the purpose of estopping plaintiff from denying that Wright was its agent to collect the note sued on; but the evidence, all save the exhibits attached to the depositions in which Wright signed his name as the agent of plaintiff or otherwise represented himself as agent, is admissible, as circumstances to be considered by the jury, in determining whether or not Wright was in fact the agent of plaintiff and authorized to receive from the defendant payment of the note in question. The exhibits objected to are not admissible. Agency can not be proved by the declaration of one who assumes and represents himself to be the agent of another, without the knowledge of the latter.</p>
    <p id="b267-5" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[164,946,1303,436]]]'>A majority of this court are of the opinion that the court did not err in refusing plaintiff permission to read in evidence the affidavit of Lewis Dabney, Esq., attorney for the Middlesex Banking Company, made in a suit brought by Dabney for said company in the District Court of Bed Biver County against Wright, wherein Wright is charged with embezzlement of the money paid to him by Dabney’s client on the note now sued on. The opinion of the court is, that the affidavit should be excluded, because not material or relevant to prove any issue in the case. The charge of the court, which is assigned as error, is as follows:</p>
    <p id="b267-6" data-blocks='[["BL_267.6",267,[162,1394,1306,1031]]]'>“Where the holder of a note, the principal of which is due, places the same in the hands of a practicing attorney at law, the presumption of law is, that said attorney at law has authority to collect such past due note, and the payment by the debtor of the principal and interest on such past due note to such attorney at law would be a valid payment of the note, and would relieve the debtor from all liability on such note. But no ■such presumption would arise if the principal of the note was not due. That a payment of the undue principal to the attorney at law would not be binding on the owner of the note, but a payment of undue principal to the attorney at law would be at the debtor’s peril. Therefore, if you believe from the evidence* that the plaintiff, the Texas Land and Loan Company,, sent the note in suit to Sims <em>&amp; </em>Wright, with instructions to •them to have the same probated in the County Court, and that the principal of the note was not due, then the payment to the attorney of the undue principal of the note would not be a discharge of such undue principal, but would be only a discharge of the interest due on the note at the time of such payment, and would require your verdict to be for the plaintiff for the amount of the principal of the note, with 12 per cent per annum interest on the note from the 14th day of October, 1889, and 10 per cent attorney fee on the gross amount, and that the same is a prior lien on the land described in the petition.”</p>

Second. Because it assumes that the defendants, in making payment to Wright, dealt with him as a practicing attorney at law, when the facts tend to show that he was dealt with as a land and loan broker, and as the agent of plaintiff, both in procuring the loan to Watson and for collecting the note due for the loan. This charge is not warranted by the facts. The only issue which should, in the judgment of a majority of this court, be submitted to the jury is, was Wright the agent of plaintiff for procuring loans for it in Red River County, and for receiving payments of principal and interest on such loans ? This issue must be determined from the dealing between Wright and plaintiff, including the whole of the correspondence between the parties; that had at the time of the delivery of the note and deed in trust to Wright, in September, 1889, as well as that had both prior and subsequent to that time; and the testimony of all witnesses as to any fact or facts relevant and material.</p>
