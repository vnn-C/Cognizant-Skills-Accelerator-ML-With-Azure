The case was tried by the court without a jury, and it will not be presumed that the court gave other than legal effect to the testimony. If the trial had been before a jury, the judge should have limited the effect of the evidence, by a charge, to the legitimate purpose of claim of ownership, the existence and loss of the deed; but there being no jury, and the evidence being admissible, it will not be presumed that the judge misapplied it.

Such testimony alone may not have been sufficient to establish the fact to be proved, but it was admissible with other facts and circumstances.</p>

They were pertinent facts, a part of the case, and should not have been excluded.</p>

J. H. Foreman et al., and it was not error to admit the sheriff’s deed to Burts reciting such fact.</p>
    <p id="b462-9" data-blocks='[["BL_462.9",462,[306,1784,1295,91]]]'>The fifth assignment of error complains that the court, in arriving at its judgment, erred in considering certain evidence adduced on the trial.</p>
    <p id="b462-10" data-blocks='[["BL_462.10",462,[303,1885,1298,388]]]'>There are no findings of fact filed by the court, and we are not able to determine what particular testimony the court considered or what weight was given to any particular part of it. The proper method of presenting the question intended, is to object to the testimony, and save a bill of exceptions if the objections should be overruled; it can not be done by assignment of error to the consideration of the testimony by the court. It would be presumed, in the absence of something to the contrary, that the court gave to the evidence its legal and proper effect only.</p>
