The judgment was of date the 11th of March, 1887; the execution was issued on the 7th day of October, 1889, directed to the sheriff or any constable of Greer County, and was levied on the horses and mules as stated. It was in form of a first execution, and did not show that any other execution had ever been issued, except that there was an item in the bill of costs for issuing an alias.</p>
