Though it was written after this suit was brought, it contained expressions which tended to show the writer’s animus towards the plaintiff, and was admissible for that purpose. Its purpose was properly explained to the jury by the charge, and they were allowed to consider it for no other purpose.</p>

The whole law of a subject like this can not be embraced in one sentence of a charge. Other parts of the charge informed the jury that the statement, to entitle plaintiff to recover, must have been false.</p>

Brown &amp; Flewellen had the right to place their claim in the hands of Hurst for collection, and to authorize him to take any lawful steps and do all lawful acts for the purpose of collecting it. And each being interested in receiving all information which the occasion made necessary or proper, the other had the right to communicate it; and any such communication would be protected by the law and privileged, though false, if not made with actual malice. But neither of them was privileged to publish to others false and defamatory statements concerning plaintiff; nor did either have the privilege of denouncing him to the other as a ' • merchant breaker,” as one “ whose practice it is to bleed those who can be duped by them”—in short, as a dishonest man, unworthy of credit or confidence, if such was the meaning of the publications issued concerning him. Of course, if such statements were true, there would be no cause of action; but if the effect of the list issued was <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>to insinuate concerning plaintiff such charges as claimed by him, and if they were false, there is no privilege which would shield them from a recovery for the damage thereby occasioned. While, as before stated, they had the privilege, on account of their relations, to communicate all proper information growing out of them, they could not make use of the occasion to utter or publish defamatory matter not relevant thereto. The privilege would not extend further than the occasion required. The assignment points out no error in the charge.</p>
