This, however, will require a reversal of the judgment.\nThe appellee, Brooks, seeks to recover from appellants the amount of a promissory note, with a decree foreclosing the vendor\u2019s lien on property described in the petition as \u201c a certain lot situated in the town of Wichita Falls, Texas, in the county of Wichita, fronting 50 feet on Seventh Street and 100 feet on Scott Avenue, on the nort side of Seventh Street, and being part of lots 8 and 9 in block 151, according to the map of said town.\u201d\nIn the decree foreclosing the lien the property is described as above set out. The sole evidence offered describing or identifying the property as that on which a vendor\u2019s lien is retained consisted in the recital in the note, that it \u201c is in part payment of purchase money for lot 50 feet on Seventh Street by 100 feet on Scott Avenue, this day deeded to us by Brooks and Penn.\u201d\nThis evidence did not authorize a foreclosure of the lien on the property as described in the petition. Daugherty v. Eastburn, 74 Texas, 68.\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.\nReversed and remanded.",

Geo. E. Miller.\nAshby S. James, for appellants.\nThe court erred in rendering judgment for the plaintiff and in foreclosing the hen as described in said judgment, because said judgment is contrary to law, and is not supported by the evidence, in this, that the note offered in evidence does not describe the land upon which the court has adjudged a foreclosure of plaintiff\u2019s lien, and there is no evidence that plaintiff has any lien upon the land described in the judgment here appealed from. Daugherty v. Eastburn, 74 Texas, 68.\nNo brief for appellee reached the Reporter."
