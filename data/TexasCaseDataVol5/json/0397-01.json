In this case appellants brought suit in Lamar County on their entire account against Munzesheimer & Klein, except $180 worth of goods, which were stopped in transitu, without either giving credit or deducting the items of goods taken back in the claim suit, and recovered judgment for the full amount sued for. This judgment had been fully satisfied at the time of the trial of this cause, and thereby appellants\u2019 right to the property in question had been released and extinguished.\nDelivered October 25, 1893.\nThe judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.\nAffirmed.\nThis case did not reach the Reporter with the other October cases.",
