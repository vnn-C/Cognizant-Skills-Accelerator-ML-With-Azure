Wife’s Intent as Against Acts. — The family left the homestead, the husband intending not to return, the wife at the time knowing such intent. After leaving, the husband conveyed the old homestead, the wife declining to join in the deed, and expressing a desire that it should not be sold. The husband bought other lands, and leased a farm; died, however, without acquiring ownership of, another homestead. In action by widow and children, the trial court having found that the homestead was abandoned, <em>held, </em>that the wife’s wishes that the homestead be not sold did not affect the power of the husband to sell.</p>

Nash and her three children brought this suit to recover certain real estate conveyed by her deceased husband, H. C. Nash, to one A. C. Harvey, and by Harvey to John Herring, the defendant in error. Plaintiffs alleged in their petition, that the property was the homestead of said H. C. Nash and Lillie L. Nash at the time the former conveyed to Harvey, and that Lillie L. Nash did not join in the conveyance. The trial court gave judgment for the defendant. There is no statement of facts in the record. The court’s conclusions of facts and law are as follows:</p>

Concerning this purchase, Nash and Barbee had been negotiating for some time, and its consummation was dependent on the success of Nash in selling the premises now in controversy, and the $500 he paid to Barbee was part of the purchase money he received from Harvey for the farm.</blockquote>

She may have had other reasons than an intention to reoccupy the property as a home for objecting to the sale. She may have considered it better, as a business proposition, for her husband to keep the property and rent it, than to sell it. It does not appear that she objected to the sale of it because she intended or desired to return and use it as a home. The court’s findings show that she testified that she did not intend to return to the property without her husband, and admitted that it was his determination never to return. The most that can be contended in behalf of Mrs. Nash is, that this statement shows, inferentially, a contingent intention on her part to return to the property. But this contingency rests upon an admitted improbability. Such an intention was too remote. We think this testimony shows that Mrs. Nash intended to leave the matter of residence <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>and homestead entirely to her husband; and while she thought it better not to sell the property in question, still whether or not it should ever be occupied any more as a home would be for her husband to determine.</p>
