Prince, Sr., filed his petition in the District Court of Ellis County, making Eebecca J. Coleman and her husband, James W. Coleman, Maggie, Mathew J., and William Moore parties defendant. The petition alleges, in substance, that in 1870 plaintiff and one Ed H. Moore, deceased, were the joint owners of lot 5, block 15, Waxahachie; that on the-day of November, 1870, petitioner bought from said Moore his half-interest in said lot for $150; that upon payment of said sum, said Moore vacated and turned said lot over to petitioner, J. E. Prince, Sr., and that since that time he had had possession thereof. It was alleged that at the time of said payment, Moore promised to execute and have placed on record a deed conveying his interest in said lot to said J. E. Prince, Sr., and petitioner was fully assured that the same was done until after the death of said Moore, when he discovered that no deed had been placed on record; that the just and equitable title in said lot was in petitioner, J. E. Prince, Sr.; that at the time of such purchase and payment, defendant E. J. Coleman was the wife of said Ed II. Moore, and that Maggie, Mathew J., and William Moore are (at the time of filing said petition) the minor children of Ed H. Moore. Petitioner prays for judgment divesting title, general relief, etc.</p>

From an inspection of the transcript, it is manifest that they were not served, although they were represented by a guardian ad litem. Upon a collateral attack, this would not be fatal to the judgment; but upon appeal or writ of error, it is reversible error. McAnear v. Epperson, 54 Texas, 220.</p>

In that case the court says: “It is a familiar rule, that there is a marked distinction between the right to impeach a judgment in a collateral proceeding, and the right to impeach it in a direct proceeding by appeal or error.” Citing Burditt v.
