This rule is founded on the reason that a resale of the property by the vendor is a harsh and arbitrary remedy. Scarborough v. Arrant, 25 Texas, 129; Tom v. Wollhoeffer, 61 Texas, 279; Coddington v.

Robinson and Mrs. Whitney are barred by limitation, and only insist on a revision of the judgment of the lower court as to the one-fourth interest of Joshua D. Robinson, who was about twenty-five years of age when the suit was instituted. Appellant Joshua D. Robinson not being barred by the statute of limitations, and having offered to refund the purchase money, with legal interest thereon from date of foreclosure sale, the only question to be decided is whether he has equity of redemption of the land by paying off the money; or has lost this right by his loches. It has been repeatedly held, that the subvendee of a vendee who owes the purchase money on land he conveys, is not a necessary party to foreclosure proceedings. Ufford v. Wells, 52 Texas, 612; Foster v. Powers, 64 Texas, 247; Land and Cattle Co. v. Boon, 73 Texas, 556.</p>
    <p id="b634-8" data-blocks='[["BL_634.9",634,[301,2318,1294,188]],["BL_635.1",635,[175,315,1301,137]]]'>These cases have been elaborately reviewed by Chief Justice Stayton in the case of Pierce v. Moreman, 84 Texas, 596, and it is held, that while these cases hold that the subvendee can not assert title as against the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, still it is not held in either of the cases that <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>equitable relief will be denied to a person, not made a party to the foreclosure proceedings, who comes asking such relief and offering to do equity.</p>
    <p id="b635-5" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[176,462,1298,437]]]'>In 1855 M. A. Dooley bought the land from Gustav Schleicher, who was the vendee of the city of San Antonio, in which deed it was stated that Schleicher was indebted for part of the purchase money of the land. In 1858 Dooley sold to the father of Joshua D. Robinson, reference being had in the deed to the conveyances from Schleicher to Dooley and from the city of San Antonio to Schleicher. The ancestor of appellant bought with full knowledge that the legal title to the land was still in the city of San Antonio, and after his purchase he held no stronger equities than those held by Schleicher.</p>
    <p id="b635-6" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[174,912,1300,984]]]'>In Pierce v. Moreman, it is said: “ These quotations from the opinions in the cases referred to clearly show that it was not the intention of this court to deny to a subvendee, not made a party .to the foreclosure proceeding, the right to pay for the land, and thus obtain title to it, whether the purchaser was the original vendor or some other person, if the equities of a subvendee were'such as to entitle him to relief under the general rules of equity applicable to the rights of vendor and vendee. Equities of a sub vendee not made a party to the proceedings to enforce a vendor’s claim for money by sale of the land are as strong against a purchaser at such sale having knowledge of his rights, as they are between the original vendor and vendee. It matters no.t whether the relief be sought by a subvendee by a suit against the purchaser, practically to enforce the right of redemption or to establish his right to pay for and have the land, or be set up by him in an action by the purchaser to recover the land; and when set up in either manner such equities will be enforced in all proper cases.” This decision, however, holds further, that the suit was promptly brought, and there could be no claim of loches or other like defense. We are by this opinion narrowed down to the decision of whether there was such loches as shown by the record to preclude appellant Joshua D. Robinson from recovering his share of the land.</p>
    <p id="b635-8" data-blocks='[["BL_635.6",635,[176,1908,1300,536]],["BL_636.1",636,[307,323,1299,85]]]'>What are the 1 <em>‘ </em>general rules of equity applicable to the right of vendor and vendee,” as applied to the claim of appellants? In equity the title to the land in controversy was in Gustav Schleicher, and he would be looked upon and treated as the owner of the land; and although the vendor remained the owner of the legal estate, he held it as a trustee for the vendee, having a lien on the land for the unpaid purchase money. As the vendee had acquired an equitable title in the land, he could encumber it or dispose of it, and his equitable rights followed it into the hands of his vendees, and their equitable rights could be asserted against those who claim under the original vendor as fully as though invoked between the original vendor and vendee. We are of the opinion that <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>there was nothing that occurred prior to the majority of appellant Joshua D. Robinson to raise the question of loches as to him.</p>
    <p id="b636-3" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[303,422,1303,1333]]]'>The same causes that will suspend the statute of limitations will usually defeat the plea of stale demand, and in many cases it has been held that infancy and coverture will be a sufficient answer to a plea of stale demand. Reed v. West, 47 Texas, 248; Hill v. Moore, 85 Texas, 336. As held in Pierce v. Moreman, equity would have permitted Schleicher or his heirs, after the foreclosure sale and before any intervening equities may have arisen, to have redeemed the title to the land by paying,the purchaser the purchase money, with interest thereon from date of foreclosure of sale. At the time this sale was made appellant Joshua D. Robinson was only nine years of age, and his father had died in 1866, about the time of the minor’s birth. There being no circumstances to charge the father with loches in connection with his equitable demand, the question of loches and stale demand could not arise in connection with his son until after his majority in 1887, less than four years before he brought this suit. The land is in the hands of the widow of J. H. Kampmann, the original purchaser, and there have been no improvements put upon the land, with the exception that it has been fenced and is being used as a pasture. The situation of the Kampmann estate has not been altered for the worse by the delay since the majority of appellant, the parties standing in about the same relation to each other that they would had the redemption taken place in 1887, or even directly after the sale in 1875. There are no circumstances surrounding the case that would render it revolting or offensive to good conscience or public convenience, but the necessary conscience, good faith, and reasonable diligence required by equity seem to be with the appellant in his demand. The rule, that equity favors the vigilant, and not those who slumber on their rights, is not, we believe, infracted by the acts of appellant Joshua D. Robinson.</p>
    <p id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[298,1768,1303,685]],["BL_637.2",637,[178,328,1300,189]]]'>Laches is a neglect to do something for a length of time that a man by law or in duty bound ought to do, and the application of the doctrine must be governed by and depend upon the facts in each case. In this case appellant might have brought this suit earlier, but he has done nothing to mislead the Kampmanns, nor have their interests been prejudiced or their rights in any manner impaired by the delay. J. H. Kampmann knew of the rights of the Robinsons when he made the purchase at the foreclosure, and knew that they had not been made parties to the suit. Nothing has been shown in this case to estop the appellant Joshua D. Robinson from asserting his claim to the land. He offers to pay off the amount due on his one-fourth share of his estate, and is in a position to ask for equity. There has been no act upon the part of this appellant calculated to cause appellees to believe that he had abandoned his claim to the land, and there are no equities that have arisen in favor of them <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>that are superior to those of this appellant; and if their equities are equal, those of appellant having priority in point of time should have the precedence, unless he had by his acts created a ground for stale demand being applied, and thereby precluded him from asserting his claim.</p>
