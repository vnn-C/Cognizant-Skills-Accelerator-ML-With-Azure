That it (plaintiff), by and through its proper agents, appeared before said Commissioners Court, while sitting as a board of equalization as aforesaid, and protested against the said three-tenths of a mile of its railway being placed on the unrendered tax roll and assessed as “ bridge,” and valued at $50,000, but said court, sitting as aforesaid, refused to correct said error. That defendant, with full knowledge of all the facts, has levied on the said tract of land for the payment of said sum of $487.50 claimed by defendant to be due for said State and county taxes as for the year 1890 on said three-tenths of a mile of said railway, and is advertising the same for sale on the 3rd <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>day of February, 1891; and plaintiff here now tenders said sum of $26.50 to pay all taxes due said county and State for the year 1890 on said three-tenths of a mile of railway, estimated at said raised valuation of $8000 per mile for 29.3 miles, as fixed by board of equalization.

      <em>Conclusions of Law. </em>— The question, raised by the assignments of error, to be determined from the facts is, Was the board of equalization of Maverick County authorized by law in its action of changing appellee’s rendition of 29.3 miles of railroad to 29 miles, and in lieu of the three-tenths mile of railroad deducted from plaintiff’s rendition, ordered the assessor to put on the unrendered roll against appellee an item as ‘ ‘ bridge ” at a valuation of 850,000, and in assessing against the same a State tax of $162.50 and a county tax of $325 ? Before a tax can become a charge upon property, it is necessary that a list of taxables should be made by the officer to whom by law that duty is entrusted. Cool, on Tax., 351. The officer upon whom such duty is imposed by the laws of this State is the assessor of taxes, who is required to take a list of taxable property in his, county and assess the value thereof in the manner specified by law. Rev. Stats., art. 4705. And in the execution of his duties he “ shall * * * follow the instructions which shall from time to time be prescribed by the Comptroller of the State.” Rev. Stats., art. 4713. “All railroad.. <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>* * * companies shall list all of their real and personal property, giving the number of miles of roadbed * * * in the county where such roadbed * * * is situated, at the full and true value, except,” etc. Rev. Stats., art. 4678. Railroad bridges over which the road is constructed are not subject of separate assessment. Cool, on Tax., 385. The instruction of the Comptroller to assessors, “ not to tax railroad bridges separately as bridges, but to include all bed as railroad, whether built on the ground or on bridges,” is binding on the assessor of taxes, and the rendition by appellee of its property for taxation in accordance with the instruction was a compliance with the law. Court v. O’Connor, 65 Texas, 334.</p>

    <p id="b675-8" data-blocks='[["BL_675.6",675,[186,871,1303,335]]]'>The rendition of property for taxes by its owner and the listing of it by the assessor in compliance with the law are provisions made for the benefit and protection of the individual tax payer, and they must be complied with in order to create a lawful demand upon the citizen for his property. For it is only by means of the requirement of official action that he can be protected against arbitrary and capricious action. Cool, on Tax., 285.</p>
    <p id="b675-9" data-blocks='[["BL_675.7",675,[185,1218,1302,489]]]'>It is only where property has not been rendered that it can be assessed and placed on the unrendered roll, and this must be done by the assessor. Rev. Stats., art. 4711. The law confers no authority whatever upon the board of equalization to direct property which has been rendered for taxes by the owner to be listed by the assessor as unrendered property, and such action being without warrant of law is absolutely void. Nowhere can be found in our laws a semblance of authority for such board having property which has been rendered under its proper classification by the owner taken from its proper list and assessed under another name as unrendered property.</p>
    <p id="b675-10" data-blocks='[["BL_675.8",675,[188,1718,1298,287]]]'>We therefore hold that the action of the board of equalization in changing plaintiff’s rendition and having its property assessed as unrendered in the manner shown by the facts in this ease, was null and void; and that the invalidity of such proceedings not appearing on the face of the assessment rolls, the injunction restraining the sale under such proceedings and its perpetuation were proper.</p>
