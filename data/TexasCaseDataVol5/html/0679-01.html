Ballard raise these questions: Did the special master in chancery have any power or authority to make him a party to the suit, to pass upon his title, or to litigate his rights, or to make any report in regard to them ?</p>
    <p id="b711-4" data-blocks='[["BL_711.5",711,[149,726,1304,528]]]'>It is well settled in equity practice, that a special master in chancery has no power or authority except such as is derived from the order of the court making the appointment. If he goes beyond this, his action has no official weight, and should be set aside. In 2 Daniels’ Chancery Practice, 1221, note 2, it is said: “ Orders of reference to a master should specify the principles on which the accounts are to be taken or the inquiry to proceed, so far as the court shall have decided thereon, and the examination before the master should be limited to such matters within the order as the principles of the decree or order may render necessary.” Referring to Remsen v. Remsen, 2 Johnson’s Chancery, 495, and a long list of authorities.</p>

Cram, <a href="/mass/26/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="26 Mass. 73" data-case-ids="2058518" data-case-paths="/mass/26/0074-01">26 Mass., 73</a>; Harris v. Ely, 4 N. Y.

F. Schmidt, deceased, and his wife, Margaret Schmidt; and in said advertisement to notify all persons having claims against such estate to appear before him at such time and place and prove their said claim. Said master is further directed to make a record of all proofs submitted to him, and to report the same, together with his findings thereon, to this court.” This order did not authorize the master to make new parties, or to make any investigation or inquiry, or to report concerning the title to real estate claimed by the receiver as a part of the community estate.</p>

Ballard can not complain of the action of the master, because he voluntarily became a party to the proceeding before such master. The record upon this point is not entirely clear. The master’s report shows that J. S. Ballard made himself a party; but the <a id="p686" href="#p686" data-label="686" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*686</a>pleadings indicate that the receiver filed his cross-bill making him a party, and Ballard’s pleading is in answer to that cross-bill. In any event, he objected in every legitimate way to the jurisdiction of the master over him, and presented the question squarely to the court.</p>

But all that portion of the judgment which appertains to J. S. Ballard, and the approval of the report of the master thereon, and divesting title out of him and vesting it in the receiver, and adjudging costs against him, is reversed, and judgment is here rendered disapproving the report of the master as to all matters affecting J.
