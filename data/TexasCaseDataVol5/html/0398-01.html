The deed of trust was duly filed for registration, and the trustee took ostensible possession of the property, and while in such possession it was levied upon by the sheriff of Dallas County, under a writ of attachment sued out in the case of the Standard Shoe Company v. Hunstable <em>&amp; </em>Moore. The trustee sued the sheriff and appellee for damages for conversion of the goods. Judgment was rendered below for the defendants, from which the trustee, Johnston, has appealed.</p>

The appellees had in their pleadings alleged that Hunstable &amp; Moore were insolvent and being pressed by their creditors before the execution of the chattel mortgage, and that it was executed for the purpose of hindering, delaying, and defrauding their creditors. In such cases the courts have not been inclined to restrict too closely inquiry into the financial condition of the partners; the testimony was admissible.</p>

One of the firm creditors of De Caussey <em>&amp; </em>Anderson, having obtained an attachment against them, intervened in the suit, claiming the prior right to subject the assets to their debt. The court found the law against them, on the ground that there was no proof of insolvency, and because it did not appear that there was not enough property to satisfy both the firm creditors and those debts upon which they were bound outside.</p>
    <p id="b426-6" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[281,1166,1302,390]]]'>In this case it appears from the testimony, that the firm was insolvent, and that the mortgage embraced all the assets of the firm, and was not enough to pay the debts. The mortgage was executed by Mr. Hunstable, for the firm; the other partner, Mr. Moore, did not testify in the case, and it does not appear that the mortgage was executed with his consent; but the right of a managing partner to execute a mortgage on the firm property to pay firm debts is fully recognized by this court in the case of Keller v.

In the case of Fitzpatrick v. Flannagan, 106 United States, 654, which is quoted with approval in the later case of Huiskamp v. Moline Wagon Company, 121 United States, 323, Judge Mathews says: “The legal right of a partnership creditor to subject the partnership property to the payment of his debt consists simply in the right to reduce his claim to judgment, and to sell the goods of his debtors on execution. His right to appropriate the partnership property specifically to the payment of his debt, in equity, in preference to creditors of an individual partner, is derived through the other partner, whose original right is to have the partnership assets applied to the payment of partnership obligations. And this equity of the creditor subsists as long as that of the partner, through which it is derived, remains; that is, so long as the partner himself, in the language of this court in Case v. Beauregard, 99 United States, 125, ‘ retains an interest in the firm assets, as a partner, a court of equity will allow the creditors of the firm to avail themselves of his equity, and enforce through it the application of <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>those assets primarily to payment of the debts due them, whenever the property comes under its administration” And in the case of Huiskamp v. Moline Wagon Company, 121 United States, 323, above, it is held that one partner, by the consent of the other, may appropriate the partnership effects to the payment of his individual debt.</p>
    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[182,560,1299,230]]]'>There is no specific lien upon the partnership assets in favor of partnership creditors. The quasi lien, so often referred to, and about which so much confusion has arisen, exists only through the primary right of the other partner to have the assets of the firm so applied as to do justice to him.</p>
    <p id="b427-6" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[184,809,1299,387]]]'>It has been held by our own Supreme Court as follows: “ That partners, by agreement between themselves, and without reference to the wishes of firm creditors, may convert partnership property into the separate property of one partner, is well settled; and when this is done, the right of the partner to have the property subjected to the payment of firm debts, as it before existed, ceases; and with the cessation of his right, goes every right in the nature of a lien the firm creditors, through him, had.” Stansell v. Fleming, 81 Texas, 298.</p>

Thompson, 85 Texas, 311, where one partner had sold out his interest in the partnership property to his brother, a short time before the failure, without reserving any lien in favor of partnership creditors, the court said: ie The quasi lien of a partnership creditor depends entirely upon the existence of the right of the individual partners to have the firm property applied to the satisfaction of the partnership debts.’ ’ And in that case it was held, that the right of the selling partner to have the partnership property so applied, having passed away by his sale, the quasi lien of the firm creditors passed with it; and the case of Willis v. Heath, 18 Southwestern Reporter, 801, is referred to with approval.</p>

The court said: “ The right is but a quasi lien, and is founded entirely upon the right of each individual partner to have the common property subjected to the payment of the debts of the firm before resorting to the separate property of the partners, individually. When the partnership is dissolved by mutual consent, or otherwise, and all the partners have retained their interest in the concern until that time, then we do not doubt that each of them, or <em>any firm, creditor, may enforce </em>

The trustee testified that none of them had accepted it. The cashier of the City National Bank testified, that the bank had not accepted; that their debt was otherwise secured, and had since been paid by Mr. Blake, who took up the collateral held by the bank. None of the creditors are parties tó this suit. Mr. Block testified, that the firm of Block Brothers had not signified any acceptance, but had brought suit for their debt. The other two debts, that of Blankenship <em>&amp; </em>Blake and that of the Blake Mutual Building and Loan Association, were both represented by Mr. Blake. There is no doubt that these two had full notice of the purposes and intentions of the mortgagor in making the instrument. What were these purposes ? The verdict of the jury, in the light of the testimony, leaves no doubt, first, that the firm of Hunstable &amp; Moore was insolvent and pressed by its creditors; second, that one member of the firm arranged with the Blake Mutual Building and Loan Association, of which Blankenship &amp; Blake are members, by which a large portion of the assets of the firm was paid upon the purchase of a lot and the erection of a dwelling upon it, which was outside of and beyond the scope of the partnership business, which was the purchase and sale, at retail, of boots and shoes; third, that before the failure, Mr. Hunstable, one member of the partnership, having sold his former homestead, moved into the house with his family, and set up claim thereto as his homestead; fourth, that a short time after the failure, the association gave William <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>Hunstable credit for the assets of the firm already paid on the house, and caused Hr. B. Blankenship to execute him a deed individually thereto, taking his individual notes, secured by a vendor’s lien on the property, which was a part of the Blankenship <em>&amp; </em>Blake addition to the city of Dallas, for the balance due; so that if there was ever any shadow of claim' for holding this to be a debt pf Hunstable <em>&amp; </em>Moore, such debt, as a firm obligation, passed away upon the novation of the contract with William Hunstable.</p>

I also sold some machines and implements which were in the repair shop.
