Wagering Contract — Ives Pool Bill — Laws of New York.— That part of the Ives pool bill which suspends for thirty days during each year a part of the penal code upon the grounds of certain associations organized for the purpose of improving the breeds of thoroughbred or trotting horses, and confines pool selling upon races to the grounds of such associations and to the times of such races, does not affect the civil statute of New York which prohibits pool selling upon horse races, and provides that contracts growing out of the same in which the parties are both participants can not be enforced.

It was claimed that in August, 1888, plaintiff below was engaged in selling pools and “ Paris mutuals ” on horse races, at the race grounds of the Island Park Association, in the city of Albany, New York, under the management of which association the races were being carried on. That during August, 1888, defendant purchased pools on said races amounting to $4459.50, on which he realized $2826.50, leaving a balance due plaintiff of $1633, which plaintiff paid to the holders of the winning tickets. That plaintiff also paid for him, to the winners, $201 on “mutuals” on horse races. Judgment was rendered in the court below for plaintiff, from which this appeal was taken.</p>

In fact, this association seems to have been organized before the act, and without any reference to it, or to improving breeds of horses.

He purchased for defendant pools on the races amounting to $4459.50, on which defendant realized $2826.50, leaving a clear loss on the races of $1633; and plaintiff’s commission on the pools was $87.50. Plaintiff also sold defendant the “ Paris mutuals,” on which his loss was $201. This was clearly an unlawful and wagering transaction, to which plaintiff was a party, and is void under the laws of New York, unless plaintiff has shown that it comes within some exception to the general law proved in this case. He has not done so. His pleading does not allege that the transaction comes within the provisions of the Ives Pool Bill, passed May 26, 1887; nor does the testimony bring it within that act. But suppose it did. A proper analysis of that part of the act which is in evidence will show: First. The levy of a tax of 5 per cent upon the gross receipts for admission on race days to the grounds of such associations as were incorporated to improve the breed of thoroughbred or trotting horses. Second. The limitation of thirty days in the year <a id="p694" href="#p694" data-label="694" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*694</a>in which races are authorized on such tracts and to be open to the public; sections 351 and 352 of the Penal Code not to apply on said grounds during such thirty days; and all such racing and pool selling to be confined to the period between the 15th day of May and the 15th day of October, and to the tracks where the races were to take place, and to the days of such races.

All contracts for or on account of any money or property or thing in action so wagered, bet, or staked, shall be void.” Because the State does not punish criminally the offense during the limited period mentioned at certain places, is no ground for holding such illegal contracts valid, when the civil statutes declare them to be void.

There had been a special act allowing horse races upon certain regulated tracks in Queens County, and exempting parties betting on such races from prosecution under the Penal Code. There was a wagering contract upon a race upon one of such regulated tracks, and they sought to enforce it in the courts. The Supreme Court said: “ But wager contracts upon such races have at all times been void since the passage of the Act of 1802. Parties may bet on races to be run on regulated courses and upon private property in the county of Queens, and such race may be run with absolute impunity. No offense is thereby committed, nor penalty or forfeiture incurred. But there is nothing in any of these statutes which makes a wager contract on such race legal, or which will permit it to be enforced in a court of law. It may be performed if the parties to it think proper to do so; but that is their concern, for at law the contract is void under the very words of the statute, as depending upon a ‘ race’ and as a 1 contingent event.’ ”</p>
