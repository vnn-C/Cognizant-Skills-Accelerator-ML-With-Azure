S. sought to acquire the land from the State, on the theory that the law as to actual settlement had not been originally complied with by B.; and having bought from C. the possession of the land, S. occupied, with some of his own children, the houses thereon, and made under the Act of 1887 an application to the State for the purchase of the land, which does not appear to have ever been acted on. The homestead of S. was in the town of V., where his wife continued to reside. B. brought suit against S. for the land, and recovered a judgment therefor, from which S. appealed. <em>Held:</em>

Roberts moved from Georgia to Wilbarger County, Texas, in the spring of 1886, with his family, consisting of a wife and children. It was his intention to acquire a section of school land as a home. Meanwhile, before making the application to purchase above referred to, he entered into a contract with a brother-in-law, one Bob Jones, whereby he was permitted to build a house on a lot belonging to the latter, and situated in the town of Vernon. By the terms of this; agreement Roberts was entitled to use this house as a residence for his family, with the option of purchasing the property and taking a deed from Jones when he should move his family to the section, or of himself receiving pay for the house from Jones.</p>
    <p id="b91-8" data-blocks='[["BL_91.6",91,[187,1418,1300,734]]]'>His family were occupying this property at the time of his application to purchase. He did not remove them to the section, because of the delicate health of his wife. He, however, as soon as he made the application, began to prepare the property for occupancy, with the intention of making it his home. It was his habit to leave Vernon on Monday morning, and to remain at work on the section during the week, until Saturday night. He slept in his wagon while on the section. He proceeded to fence the land and to prepare it for cultivation, when, after the lapse of fifteen months, having fenced 40 acres and broken 20, and planted a crop, he exchanged the section for one which belonged to a Mr. Tom Jones, and which he preferred. He moved his family to the latter section, on which he has ever since resided. He then took a deed from his brother-in-law to the house and lot in Vernon, and by direction of Tom Jones, with whom he had exchanged, he executed to Richard Geoghegan the conveyance already set out.</p>

Two months before the expiration of this lease (which in terms forbade subletting), Cooper, in consideration of $60 paid to him by the appellant, Swan, abandoned the property and yielded possession to the latter. Swan, with five of his children, went into the house, using bedding and a cook stove left with Mm by Cooper, but the property of Busby. He then proceeded to make application for the purchase of the section under the Act of 1887. He forwarded his application and obligation to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and a remittance of one-fortieth of the purchase money to the Treasurer, but they do not appear to have been received by these officers. Swan never in fact resided upon this section. While he occupied the house upon the land, his homestead was in the town of Vernon, where his wife resided and continued to reside.</p>

      <em>Opinion. </em>— We abstain from considering, as unnecessary to a disposition of this appeal, the question whether, under the facts stated, J. T. Roberts should be considered an actual settler within the provisions of the Act of 1883. Certainly, if he was not such a settler, the defendant Swan can not be so regarded within the terms of the statute of 1887, which emphatically requires an actual residence upon the land sought to be acquired. Baker v. Millman, 77 Texas, 46; Metzler v. Johnson, 1 Texas Civ. App. ,137; Atkeson v. Bilger, decided by us at this term [4 Texas Civ.App., 99]; Burleson v. Dunham, 46 Texas, 152..</p>
    <p id="b92-6" data-blocks='[["BL_92.6",92,[286,1460,1302,485]]]'>The possession of the appellant Swan is so intimately connected with that of Cooper, the betrayal of whose tenancy he bought for $60, that it should be viewed with no greater favor. And as, after the repudiation of his landlord’s title, Cooper, without acquiring a superior title from some other source, would have been unable to resist a recovery by his landlord, Busby, resting alone upon the relation of tenancy and upon prior possession, the appellant’s attitude must be deemed equally weak.
