The court below sustained an exception to appellant’s petition, on the ground that the deed prohibited only the immediate grantee therein from using the premises for the purposes therein named, and did not extend to his assignees. No question is raised as to the validity of a condition of this kind; but the contention is, that inasmuch as a forfeiture is claimed for the breach of a condition subsequent, the doctrine of strict construction applies, and the condition will not be extended beyond its express terms; and inasmuch as assigns are not expressly named, they can not be bound thereby.</p>
    <p id="b515-7" data-blocks='[["BL_515.8",515,[179,1498,1300,884]]]'>That the law applies the rule of strict construction when a forfeiture is claimed for the breach, of a condition subsequent, there can be no question. 2 Washb. on Real Prop., 8. And upon this ground it has been very generally laid down by text writers, that “ <em>where a condition applies in terms to the </em>grantee, without mentioning assigns, they will not be included.” See Henderson v. Beaton, 1 Posey’s Unreported Cases, 28, where the language of Mr. Washburn on this question is quoted with approval. To sustain this view, the cases of Emerson v. Simpson, 43 New Hampshire, 475, and Page v. Palmer, 48 New Hampshire, 385, are invariably cited. These cases are no doubt authority for the proposition, that where the deed in terms exacts the doing of something by the grantee by name, and does not make the same requirement of his heirs or assigns, a forfeiture will not be decreed for their failure; and hence it will be noted that the text writers, in stating the principle, apply it to cases where the “condition <em>in terms </em>applies to the grantee.” In this case it will be noted that the condition in the deed does not in terms apply to the grantee in stating the prohibition, but applies to the <em>lot itself. </em>The language is, “ the property hereinafter described shall not be used,” etc.</p>

Marcy, 25 Connecticut, 241, the condition was quite similar to the one here involved, and the court seemed to take it for granted that it would apply to a lessee of the grantee, although the point was not directly made. In none of the cases we have examined, where the condition prohibited the use of the property for a specified purpose, has it been held or intimated that an assignee of the grantee would acquire greater rights in this respect than his grantor had; and upon principle it does not seem to us he should be allowed to do so.</p>

G-raber, 66 Texas, 465, the condition was that the land should be used “for the purpose of a street only, and in case the same shall be used for any other purpose, this deed shall be null and void, and the title to said premises shall revert to” the grantors, and it was held to apply to an assignee of the grantee. Also, in Pugh v. Mays, 60 Texas, 191, there was an exchange of land, each deed containing a stipulation, that if the grantee was ousted from possession the deed should be of no effect, and he should have the right to re-enter, and this clause was held good against a purchaser from the grantee, although the deeds also contained covenants of general warranty of title. Also, see Berryman v. Schumaker, 67 Texas, 312.</p>

The land was his; the condition was one he had the right to impose; his intention in this case is clear, and no one claiming under this conveyance can avoid its effect.
