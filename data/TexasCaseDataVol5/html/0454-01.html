Liability of Railway in the Hands of Trustees. — A provision in the railway charter which authorized the company to raise money by the sale of ¡bonds, and to secure the bonds by a mortgage of its road, capital stock, franchises, etc., did not authorize the company to surrender the control and management of its road to the trustees in such mortgage, and thus relieve itself from its liabilities and duties to the State and the public.

Before the shipment, the consignors delivered this writing to the agent of the steamship company, who took It up and gave the consignors bills of lading, the terms of which excused the steamship company from liability for loss by robbers or thieves. The train was robbed on the way to Brazos, and the money shipped was never delivered to the steamship company. The limitation of liability in the bill of lading was held to apply only to carriage by ship, and not to carriage by the railway company.</p>

      <em>Conclusions of Law. </em>— 1. We do not deem it necessary to enter upon an examination of the authorities or a discussion of the cases with the view to determine the weight of authority from this and other States upon the question presented by appellant as. to its liability as a common <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>carrier while its railway is being operated by trustees under authority conferred by a mortgage of its railway property and franchises, because we are of the opinion that in this State a railway company can not voluntarily surrender the management and control of its railway to others, and thereby relieve itself of its duties and liabilities to the State and to the public. This has been practically decided by our Supreme Court in the case of Woodhouse v. Rio Grande Railway Company, 67 Texas, 416, wherein the appellant here was appellee in a cause of action that arose during the management of the same trustees. It does not appear that in that case the court had under consideration the clause in the defendant’s charter, which is a special act of the Legislature, authorizing the company to raise money by the sale of bonds and to secure the same by a mortgage of its road, its capital stock, its corporate franchises, etc., in such manner and form as said company or its directors might deem best and expedient; but we are of the opinion that the power to mortgage- contained in the charter is not sufficient to authorize the defendant to surrender control of its railway and the management thereof to other persons, and relieve itself of its liabilities and duties to the State and public. We hold, therefore, that the trustees, Celaya and San Roman, must be treated as the agents of the defendant for the management and operation of its railway in the discharge of its duties as public carriers, and that the defendant is liable for the loss occurring during such control.</p>
    <p id="b485-5" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[159,1417,1302,781]]]'>2. The case was tried upon a statement of the facts which had been agreed upon and filed by the parties. When it was offered on the trial, the defendant objected to it as an entirety, for the several different reasons stated in the exceptions to its admission appearing at the end of the statement. The objections do not point out the particular portions of the evidence objected to, nor does it appear-what part of the evidence was offered by the defendant. We do not feel that we should be required to pass upon the number of objections addressed to the entire evidence, especially when it is not shown what part of the evidence was subject to the objections; but we do not think there was any error in overruling the objections, even if they should be entertained, because the defendant was liable for the acts of the trustees as its agents, and it was not necessary in order to authorize the introduction of the evidence that such agency should be averred. The surrender of the control of its railroad by the defendant was its voluntary act, and not in obedience to authority of a court, as in the case of a receiver.</p>
    <p id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[162,2211,1302,288]],["BL_486.3",486,[309,326,1300,285]]]'>3. It is now well settled, that legal interest may be allowed upon the value of the goods as a part of the measure of damages when a common carrier has not delivered them according to contract. Railway v. Jackson, 62 Texas, 212. The court in this case, sitting as a jury, awarded interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum until the law went into effect changing the rate to 6 per c.ent. The objection is made that 6 per cent <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>only should have been allowed for the entire time. It would seem that the object of the rule is to give the shipper the current rate of legal interest on the value of his property which has been lost. This the court has given, and we see no error in its action. There is authority for this rule in cases of contract where the rate of interest is not stipulated. White v. Lyons, 42. Cal., 279, and other authorities cited by appellees.</p>
