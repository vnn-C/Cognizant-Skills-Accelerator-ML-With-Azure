Though the Act of 1883, under which the sale was made, was not fully complied with, all defects in appellee’s title were cured by subsequent legislation, if he became an actual bona fide settler within the six months, as provided in that act. The application to purchase was registered in the surveyor’s office in July, 1885, but the award was not made by the Land Board till sometime in August following. The jury found, under appropriate instructions, that he became an actual bona fide settler within six months of the latter date, and that finding is supported by the evidence.</p>
