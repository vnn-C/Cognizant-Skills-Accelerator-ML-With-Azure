      <em>Opinion. </em>— 1. The appellees, plaintiffs below, in the trial court, at some stage during the pendency of this suit, took a nonsuit and the cause was dismissed. They subsequently made a motion in writing to have the order of dismissal set aside, and that the case be reinstated upon the docket. This was done by the trial court, as requested, and the costs were taxed against the appellees. The appellant objected to the reinstating of the case upon the docket and to setting aside the order of dismissal, because no grounds therefor were stated in appellees’ motion, and no reasons were shown or existed that authorized the trial court to set aside the order of dismissal and to reinstate the case.</p>

      <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>It does not appear from the record what facts, if any, influenced the action of the trial court in this particular, nor is it shown that the court did not have before it some facts that would authorize it to exercise its discretion in the matter. In complaining of orders of this character, the party should come prepared to show that the court has abused its discretion in acting in the manner complained of. This is not shown in this case.</p>
    <p id="b581-3" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[191,680,1302,534]]]'>2. No error was made in overruling the appellant’s demurrer to the petition. It sufficiently described the land, and alleged that the appellant had no title to convey at the time he executed his deed with covenant of warranty to the appellees, and that such title had been defeated by the heirs of John W. Hann by the judgment rendered in the Federal court in a suit in which the title to this land was involved, and in which the appellees were defendants, and of the pendency of which suit the appellant had notice and was requested and invited to become a party in order to defend the title he had conveyed to the appellees. We think these facts stated a good cause of action against the appellant on his warranty.</p>
    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[192,1227,1300,387]]]'>3. The point is raised in the fourth assignment of error, that the identity between cause number 434 in the Federal court at San Antonio and cause number 2147 in the Federal court at Austin is not shown. It seems that the suit was originally instituted in the United States Circuit Court at Austin, and was subsequently transferred to the same court sitting at San Antonio, where it was finally disposed of by the judgment rendered in the cause. We think the identity of these suits as the same controversy is shown by the facts.</p>
    <p id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[195,1626,1298,236]]]'>4. The proposition is submitted in appellant’s fifth assignment, that as he was notified to appear and defend the suit pending in the Federal court at Austin, he was not required to follow the cause to San Antonio upon its removal there, and that the judgment rendered in the Federal court at San Antonio is not binding upon him.</p>
    <p id="b581-6" data-blocks='[["BL_581.7",581,[196,1871,1299,340]]]'>We can not assent to the correctness of this proposition. If the appellant was properly notified so as to make him a party to the suit pending at Austin, his status as a party is not lost or destroyed upon changing the venue of the cause for trial to some other county or place. If he is originally correctly in the suit, he is in it until its final disposition, unless he is dismissed by death or agreement of the parties or order of the court. He is not lost as a party by the act of transfer from one place to another.</p>
    <p id="b581-8" data-blocks='[["BL_581.8",581,[197,2220,1301,191]]]'>5. In reply to the sixth assignment of error, we think it sufficiently appears from the facts that the 235 acres of land conveyed by the deed executed by the appellant to appellees is a part of the 640 acres J. W. Hann survey litigated in the suit in the Federal court at San Antonio.</p>

The effect of this judgment is to establish the superiority of the title of Hann’s heirs over that of the appellees — acquired from the appellant — to the land in controversy. The appellant, in legal contemplation, being a party to that judgment, it is conclusive and binding upon him.</p>

The court below, and this court in its original opinion, held that appellee was entitled to recover from appellant the amount of purchase money paid him for the land. We are still of the opinion that this ruling is correct. The judgment rendered in the Federal court established the fact that the title of the Ilann heirs was superior to that which the appellees had acquired from the appellant. The establishment of this fact by a judgment, to which we hold that the appellant- was a party, establishes the superiority of the Hann title, and as a consequence the breach of the covenant of warranty executed by Thieldf The cost of the title which the appellees acquired from the heirs of Nowlin is not the measure of damages for the breach of appellant’s warranty. That title is a matter about which the appellant has no concern. If the appellees saw fit to purchase that title, it could not result to the benefit of appellant, and would not relieve him from the consequences that resulted from a total failure of the title which he attempted to convey to appellees. To rule otherwise would be to hold that the appellees must, in addition to the payment made in subsequently acquiring a good title, pay the appellant in part for a title which a legal judgment, binding upon him, has declared to be worthless. Such a holding would relieve the appellant from the consequences of the breach of his covenant of warranty, and would require the appellees to pay twice for the same land.</p>
