    <p id="b168-8" data-blocks='[["BL_168.11",168,[294,1857,1300,436]]]'>The defendant pleaded a general denial; that he made certain repairs upon the house, among others a staircase costing $175; that when he vacated the house he owed $50 rent; that plaintiff, through his agent, J. Tobler, agreed to take said new stairway for the rent due and the old stairway taken out by defendant; that plaintiff had ever since then used the new stairway, and was estopped from denying that he agreed to take same in satisfaction of any indebtedness due by defendant. The defendant also pleaded $175, the value of the stairway placed in the house by him, as a setoff and in reconvention against the plaintiff’s demand.</p>

      <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>The building in question was a two-story house. At the time appellee rented it, there was a spiral stairway about the middle of one of the side walls, and near said wall. There was also a partition wall which divided one story into two rooms. These appellee took out, and put in a new stairway in the front of the building, at a cost of §174. At the time appellee rented the house from appellant’s agent, he told the agent that some changes would have to be made in it before it could be used for a saloon, the business appellee designed and used it for; and said agent told him to make any changes necessary to carry on his business.</p>
    <p id="b169-5" data-blocks='[["BL_169.5",169,[172,766,1298,536]]]'>Two lease contracts were put in evidence, in each of which appellee obligated himself to return the building in as good condition as received, ordinary wear and tear excepted. The last lease expired February 1, 1887, after which appellee held possession of the premises until the following July. He refused to sign another contract to pay rent at the rate of §60 per month, but offered to lease it at §50 per month. Whether or not there was an agreement that he should pay only §50 per month at any time after February 1, 1887, is a question upon which there is conflict of testimony. At any rate, during the time in question, appellee paid on the rent §270, and when he vacated the premises he claimed that he only owed §50 rent, while appellant claims that he owed §90.</p>
    <p id="b169-6" data-blocks='[["BL_169.6",169,[172,1313,1296,281]]]'>Appellee testified, that he told appellant’s agent, Tobler, that he owed §50 rent; that appellant might have the new stairway for §100, §50 to be paid in money, and the other §50 to be applied to the rent; that said agent promised to think about it and let him know in a few days, and had never given him a reply; that this was before appellee vacated the house.</p>

The charge assumes that the stairway was not a fixture; or if it was a fixture, it was such an one as appellee had a right to remove if he erected it with appellant’s consent. In the light of the evidence in the record, which we have already summarized, neither of these assumptions was permissible.</p>

Ewell on Fixt., ch. 4, p. 80. Under the testimony in the transcript, the stairway in question is not embraced in either of these classes.</p>

This was a fixture in the sense which made it a part of the realty, and as much the property of the owner of the land as was any other part of the house. This appellee removed, and substituted the one in question for it. Therefore the latter became as much a fixture and as irremovable, without the consent of the owner of the premises, as was the former.</p>
