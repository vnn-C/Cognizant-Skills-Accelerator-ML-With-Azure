Cotton, under the terms of the contract, was to furnish the money necessary for the enterprise, while R. W. Dorphley and his associates were to <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>attend to securing, purchasing, and getting the land in proper condition for development, improvement, or sale. The fact that the property so bought was to be conveyed to Cotton as trustee did not prevent the interest of each of the parties from vesting under the contract; and Dorphley having done all required of him under the terms of the contract, having furnished his labor for four years in purchasing and getting in proper condition for development, improvement, or sale the land in controversy, he had a vested interest in the property that he could alienate, especially when other purchases under the contract were suspended.</p>
    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.4",617,[175,770,1303,882]]]'>The prime question to be determined is, did an interest in the property purchased and improved under the terms of the contract vest in Dorphley ? If so, it is immaterial what the mode might be, or the time in which he was to reap the benefit. If he had a vested interest, it could not be fettered by any restraints of alienation, and neither in the contract sued on is there any attempt to curtail his right of alienation. It would not matter whether this interest was a legal or equitable one, the cestui que trust, when it is once vested in him, may dispose of it by alienation or otherwise. This is the well settled law of England, and has been approved and applied in a large number of the American States. “ The owner of property is governed by the rules of law, both in the use and enjoyment and in disposing of his property; and the doctrine in question seems to be founded upon the rule, that title to property carries with it the right of alienation and liability for debts, and it seems impossible that there can be any reason for a different rule in public policy, under a free government, having for its object the growth and development of a commercial people.” 1 Perry on Trusts, secs. 386, 386a; Seymour v.

    <p id="b617-6" data-blocks='[["BL_617.5",617,[178,1665,1299,734]]]'>In the case of Seymour v. Freer et al., heretofore cited, Henry Seymour and Jeremiah Price entered into a contract containing the following provisions: Price agreed that he would devote his time and attention and exercise his best judgment in purchasing lands, to an amount not exceeding $5000, in the States of Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio, and in the Territories of Michigan and Wisconsin, or in such of them as he should find most advantageous for the interest of Seymour; the contracts were to be made and the conveyances to be taken in Seymour’s name; the purchases were to be made after full and careful search for the most profitable investments in tracts of land of moderate extent. Seymour agreed to furnish the $5000; that after five years the lands so purchased should be sold, and Price should receive one-half of the profits for his services. The lands were bought and titles vested in Se3rmour. This contract was made in 1835. Seymour died in 1837, and Price in 1854. The suit was brought by the administrator of Price in 1864.</p>

A trust is where there are rights, titles, and interests in property distinct from the legal ownership. In such cases the legal title, in the eye of the law, carries with it, to the holder, absolute dominion; but behind it lie beneficial rights and interests in the same property belonging to another. These rights, to the extent to which they exist, are a charge upon the property, and constitute an equity which a court of equity will protect and enforce whenever its aid for that purpose is properly invoked. Interests in real estate, purely contingent, may be made the subjects of contract and equitable cognizance as between the proper parties. The object of the trust here was to sell the property within the time limited, and after deducting from the proceeds the outlay, with interest and taxes, to pay over to Price one-half of the residue. To this extent, Seymour was a trustee and Price a cestui que trust. They had a joint interest in the property. Seymour held the legal title, but the rights of Price were as valid in equity as those of Seymour were at law.” The court in that case held that the agreement did not constitute a partnership, and then says: “ But the result is the same as if we held that the parties were co-partners. In that event Seymour would still have held the property as trustee for the firm, according to the rights of the respective members.”</p>
    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.4",618,[289,1316,1299,776]]]'>In the contract between Cotton and Dorphley and others there is no specified time in which the sale of the lands was to take place, there being, indeed, no provision for sale at all, as strenuously insisted on by appellees; but the contract provides that the profits to arise from the purchases, not sales, were to be divided among the parties. It may have been contemplated, and doubtless was, that houses should be built upon the land and rented, and whenever that was done, Dorphley or his assigns had a right to his interest in the rents. If the land had been sold, then Dorphley or his assigns would have been entitled to his pro rata share of all moneys arising from the sale of the land over and above the amount expended in improvements or taxes, with legal interest from date of expenditure of the amounts. In this connection, it is scarcely necessary to say, that it is the duty of Cotton to pay the taxes, and that any adverse title that he or any other party to the contract might obtain under a sale for taxes could not deprive Dorphley of his equitable interest in the land.</p>

Freer case the deed was made directly in favor of Seymour, without designating any trust; but the deeds to Cotton specify that the conveyance is made “ for himself and as trustee for his associates, and for Noyes Rand, C. P. Ehrman, and R. W. Dorphley.” If the allegations of the petition of appellants are true — and in testing them under demurrer they are taken as true — Dorphley had done all that the contract required at his hands, and became invested with an interest in the <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>land, as herein before indicated; and having the interest, he had full power to sell it.</p>

They hold that where a peculiar trust is reposed in a certain person that he had no power to substitute another to perform work for which he has been employed. There is no question in this case as to a trustee trying to substitute another in his place. The contract between the parties, so far as Dorphley was concerned, was an executed one, and there was neither necessity nor effort on his part to substitute any one in his place. He simply sold out his interest.</p>
