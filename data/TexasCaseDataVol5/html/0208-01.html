The grantee of the certificate conveyed an undivided one-third interest, describing certificate as for “ one-half league.” <em>Held, </em>the misdescriptive word one-half did not vitiate the deed. Reference was made in the deed to the certificate. Under the laws of Texas at the time the certificate was issued, a certificate for one-half league could not issue as a headlight. In a deed where several particulars are descriptive of the premises conveyed, if some are false or inconsistent and the true be sufficient of themselves, they will be retained and the others rejected. Therefore an undivided one-third interest in the league and labor located by virtue of the certificate was conveyed by the deed.</p>

      <em>Conclusions of Law. </em>— Does the conveyance by Ward to A. J. Fowler of an undivided one-third interest in and to one-half league of land, being the headright claim of Mathew McCabe, issued by the Board of Land Commissioners of Bed Biver County, describe the land in controversy, or give data from which the description may be found and made certain ? If it does, the description is sufficient. Catlett v. Starr, 70 Texas, 488; Norris v. Hunt, 51 Texas, 614; Bowles v. Beal, 60 Texas, 324; Coker v. Roberts, 71 Texas, 602; Overland v.Menczer,83 Texas, 123. Under the Constitution and laws of Texas in force at the time the certificate to McCabe was issued, a headright certificate could not issue for one-half of a league of land. It must have been for a league and labor, if issued to the head of a family, or for one-third of a league, if issued to a single man. McCabe was entitled to, and there was issued to James J. Ward, as his assignee, by the Board of Land Commissioners of <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>Red River County, a headright certificate of one league and labor. It was an undivided one-third interest in “ land, being' the headright claim of Mathew McCabe issued by the Board of Land Commissioners of Red River County,” that was conveyed by Ward to Fowler; and its being described as “ a half of league,” instead of a league and labor, was not such a misdescription as would vitiate the deed, for when the head-right claim of McCabe issued by the Board of Land Commissioners was referred to, it would show that the quantity of the land was a league and labor, and not a half of a league. If, in construing the deed, any force should be given to the words “ one-half” preceding the word “ league,” it would, on account of the inconsistency between the terms and the descriptive words following, render the deed nugatory; for we have seen that there could be no such a “ headright claim ” as a half a league of land in this State.</p>

Applying this principle, rejecting the false and taking the true, and giving to them their full meaning, it is evident that a one-third undivided interest in the headright claim of Mathew McCabe issued by the Board of Land Commissioners of Red River County, which is the league and labor of land in controversy, was conveyed by the deed.</p>

When the patent issued to Ward he held the legal title, in subordination to the equitable title of Fowler, to a one-third undivided interest, which vested in him by virtue of the conveyance. As to Fowler’s interest, the legal title was a bare naked trust in the patentee. Ward was a trustee simply, without interest in the third he had conveyed, for his vendee; and the trust relation continued until it was repudiated by Ward’s heirs in instituting this suit; for there is no evidence showing any intention on the part of Ward or his heirs to claim or hold the land adversely to Fowler or his assignees until this suit was filed.

Ward during his lifetime. He was true to his trust for a period of over thirty years. His heirs can not now recover possession of the property from his vendees who hold possession of the land by virtue of an equitable title superior to the legal title of appellees.</p>
