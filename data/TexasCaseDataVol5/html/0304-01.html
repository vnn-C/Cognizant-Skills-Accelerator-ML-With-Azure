      <em>Conclusions of Law. </em>— When the property is claimed which has been levied upon by virtue of a writ of execution, sequestration, attachment, or other like writ, and bond given by the claimant to try his right to it, and the affidavit and bond, together with the writ, have been returned by the officer in accordance with the provisions of our statutes governing the proceedings for the trial of the right of property, the claimant can not escape the obligation of his bond by returning the property to the officer making the levy, nor has such officer any authority to receive the .property, before the trial of the issue for which the affidavit was made and the bond executed. As soon as the affidavit is made and the bond approved, it is the duty of the officer “ to deliver the property so claimed to the person so claiming it.” The writ is returned to the court from whence it issued; the authority of the officer under it ceases; the obligation of the claimant and his sureties on the bond to perform its conditions attaches, and becomes a right of the plaintiff in execution, <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>which can not be discharged, nor the right of plaintiff determined, except in the manner provided by statute — that is, by the claimant establishing his right to the property, or in case of his failure to do so, and judgment being rendered against him and his sureties for the value of the property, to within ten days from the rendition of the judgment return such property in as good condition as he received it, and pay for the use of the same, together with the damages and costs. It is only after the judgment is rendered against the claimant, upon his failure to establish his right to the property, that he can deliver it to the officer, and only then is the officer authorized by law to receive it. This is the “ return ” of the property provided for in the bond, and no other is authorized.</p>
    <p class="decisiondate" id="b334-8" data-blocks='[["BL_334.1",334,[321,1923,548,36]]]'>Delivered November 29, 1893.</p>
    <p id="b334-3" data-blocks='[["BL_334.5",334,[282,874,1296,487]]]'>The sheriff not being authorized to receive the property when it was tendered to him by Burst’s attorney on the 19th day of May, 1890, the other affidavit and bond then made were alike unauthorized, and their return to the County Court of Webb County conferred no jurisdiction on said court to try the right to said property; and in consequence all the proceedings of the court in the pretended cause styled <em>ii </em>Padgitt Brothers v. Joseph Durst, number 453,” are null and void. This disposes of the question as to the effect of the alleged return of the property to the sheriff, and of the pretended judgment in the so-called cause number 453, which are all the questions raised by appellants’ assignment of errors.</p>
    <p id="b334-4" data-blocks='[["BL_334.6",334,[279,1373,1297,187]]]'>We have some doubt as to whether appellees were not restricted to the remedy provided in the statutory proceedings for the trial of the right of property, and having failed to pursue that remedy, whether they could maintain a separate action on the bond.</p>
