This obtains as well in interstate as in local transportation.</p>

They are fully met by notifying the delivering agent at point of destination, who is necessarily present and dealing with the shipper or his agent at the time the stock are received by the consignee. In this most material regard these contracts differ from contracts which require notice to an unascertained, inaccessible, and distant party, and authorities holding contracts of the latter kind to be unreasonable do not apply in this case.

The right of the parties in interstate shipments to incorporate in their contracts such a provision as this is admitted upon the ground that it must be reasonable in ■order to be binding upon the shipper. Such a contract, we think, stands upon the same footing as a regulation or rule of the carrier regarding shipments over its line. Although the contract is in a certain sense a voluntary and mutual act of the parties to it, yet, as a fact, the unequal standing of the parties in their relation to each other over the matter of shipment and the terms and conditions that shall govern it, is as great in the matter of providing the terms of the contract as in making the regulations and rules by the carrier. The carrier has it in its power to force upon the shipper such provisions and terms in the contract of shipment <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>as the exercise of its will or pleasure may dictate. The unequal position occupied by the shipper in making such contract, and his weakness in this respect, are relieved by a rule of public policy that imposes upon the carrier the authority to exercise its great power in this respect in contracting with reference to shipments only when the stipulations agreed upon are reasonable. The fact that the shipment may be interstate does not accord the carrier the right to impose upon the shipper a contract that is unreasonable in its terms. The law does not undertake to define when a provision of a contract such as that before us is reasonable, but the determination of that fact must be gathered from the facts of each particular case. Such being true, it must be ascertained by the jury. Express Co. v. Darnell, 62 Texas, 689; Railway v.
