Disposition of Excess in Foreclosure Sale. — In foreclosure proceedings against the original vendee and his subvendee, it is error in the decree to require an excess of proceeds of the sale over the judgment to be paid to the original vendee.

The land for which the note sued on was given being property of the community estate of plaintiff T. C. Cross and her deceased husband, E. R. Beeson, who left surviving two children, and said T. C. Cross having sold the land while and as administratrix of the said community estate, and having married her co-plaintiff, she ceased, by operation of law, to be or to have any power as such administratrix. The note in her hands was property of said estate; and though on its face made payable to her, but secured by a vendor’s lien especially retained on land belonging to said estate, she can not, independent of the heirs of said Beeson and without administration on his estate, maintain suit on said note.

Cross, sued Frank Field and the appellant on a promissory note for $2428, dated May 18, 1889, due May 19, 1891, bearing 10 per cent interest per annum, and stipulating for 10 per cent attorney fees if placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, retaining vendor’s lien on the land described in the petition, conveyed to Field by her; the note being part consideration for the land; the deed also retaining the lien for the purchase money. The petition shows, that she was, at the time of the sale, the surviving wife of E. E. Beeson — a feme sole — and as such (duly qualified to administer the community estate of herself and deceased husband), and in her own right, conveyed the land to Field, taking the note sued on in part payment therefor, payable to her, F. C. Beeson. Since then she has intermarried with her coplaintiff. The Llano Improvement and Furnace Company purchased the land from Field, with notice of the existing lien.</p>

That by her last marriage, plaintiff Mrs. Cross lost control of the community estate of the former marriage, and now has no authority to prosecute the suit without joining the two children.</p>

C. Cross, and the said children; Mrs. Cross being impleaded therein on her warranty in the conveyance to Field, $4100 having been paid to her of the purchase price of the land; in which suit, it is alleged, plaintiffs therein will probably recover all or a portion of the land, in which event Mrs. Cross would not be able to respond upon her warranty; prayer that this suit abate until that suit is determined.</p>

      <em>Opinion. </em>— We think it unnecessary to discuss the ruling upon defendants’ exception to the petition, it not appearing therein but that Mrs. Cross was both the equitable and legal owner of the note.</p>

    <p id="b204-8" data-blocks='[["BL_204.9",204,[299,1321,1297,332]]]'>But we think that where it is shown that the legal right of the trustee has been brought to an end by the act of the parties or by the law, the right to sue would also be at an end. For instance, an agent to whom a note is payable should not be allowed to sue in his own name after his powers have been expressly revoked; and the maker, with knowledge of the facts, can and ought to resist the suit.

    <p id="b204-10" data-blocks='[["BL_204.11",204,[297,1869,1298,482]]]'>The land for which the note was a part payment was the property of the estate; the legal title under the terms of the sale, the deed retaining a lien to secure payment, remained in the estate, and was vested in her and the two children, subject to her control as survivor, which ceased upon her marriage. In a suit involving title to the land, the heirs, children of the first marriage, would be necessary parties. The note is the proceeds of the land, and its ownership is derived therefrom. The suit is to foreclose the lien held by the note, which, when enforced and the land sold, will pass the legal title of the land to the purchaser. We think, in such case, the children are necessary parties to the foreclosure suit.</p>
