He alleged negligence on appellant’s part; first, in keeping its roadbed in bad condition, which caused the injury; and second, in furnishing a defective hand car, with broken brakes, so that the same could not be controlled, and which, after appellee fell, ran into the car on which he had been riding, pushed it upon him, and caused his injuries. <em>Meld:</em>

Appellee himself testified: That on the 12th day of December, 1887, he was in the emplo)r of appellant on what is known as the Hillsboro branch of its railway, and was foreman of the gang, having about forty men in his charge, and on December 10, 1887, the cars ran off the track near Fish Tank number 1, and he was stationed about ten miles from that, with his boarding car and forty men. On Monday, December 12, 1887, he was ordered to go and fix up the track so as to pass trains. They passed a train about 9 o’clock, loaded with iron and a very heavy freight train.- As they were going in at noon he, appellant, was riding on the front of the hand car, with his hands crossed under his legs, feet hanging down in front of the hand car, which made his feet about four inches from the ties; that all section foremen ride that way; and just after <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>he passed a cattle guard, when his attention was attracted by a man in a field, and as he was turning his head, his right foot caught by the heel, which threw him lengthwise on the track. The car pushed him ahead. The second car was about twenty steps behind; the third about the same distance behind the second. He let loose the car when he fell off. After the first car struck him, the second car struck the first car, which lie thought hurt him as bad as the first one. The third car did not hurt him at all. The track was in bad condition — a new one — and every time a train passed over, it mashed down. We had not been at work on this track for about a week before the train ran off. We. had passed over the place where I got hurt all right about four hours before I got hurt. After the train referred to passed, I followed it on a hand car, and got hurt as before stated. At the rate we were travelling, if the brakes were in good condition and applied (meaning hand car), the car could be stopped at from thirty to forty feet. I never noticed the condition of the track at the time and place in particular (meaning place where he was hurt). I wore a square heel on my boot at the time. I do not know what my heel caught on, and never did know. The track was in open view of me, and I was conversant with the vicinity of the track. When I was riding on the ear my feet were about four inches above the ground. I suppose it would have been safer on some other part of the car. I knew what effect a train passing over the track would be. I knew nothing about the hand car being defective. I had a man to repair them. Did not know that second hand car was twenty steps behind. I estimated that it was. It was my orders not to run any closer than that. Mr. Smith (meaning Tom Smith) was sitting by me when my foot caught. The car did not leave the track.

He was holding his feet out in front of him, .with his hands crossed under his legs. If he had let them hang naturally, I think they would have dragged the ground. I do not know what caused him to fall off, as I was looking at a man near by in the field. As I saw him falling off, I put my foot out, and when the second car hit the first I was lifting up the front end of it. Plaintiff was foreman of the gang; 1 was second foreman. He had charge of the track; I was under him. Riding on the front of the car is the most dangerous part, I think. There is no seat made there to ride on. • I saw the car afterwards. There was nothing the matter with the brakes, that I know of.

I did not discover anything unusual about the track. The way we examine track is to stop and fix it up. The mud was nearly up to the top of the rail. The rail was about four inches above the ties. As soon as I saw the accident, I hallooed to the other car to stop, and threw up my hands to them. I was so excited that I could not tell what they said.

I do not know whether it was hard to stop with brakes or not. 1 never examined the brakes. Mr. Dunn worked or tinkered with the car every few days. Witness said that they were going at about six or seven miles per hour at the time of the accident; second car was about fifty or sixty feet behind the first, and the third about one hundred feet behind the second. They ran from six to ten feet with appellee under the car after he had fallen off. He had his weight against the car, and did his best to stop it. Witness did not know whether it was more dangerous to ride on the front part of the car or not. He said it usually takes to stop a car, at the speed and considering the grade on which they were, about ninety feet.

    <p id="b392-6" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[299,1067,1300,340]]]'>The grounds set out in appellee’s amended petition upon which he bases his right to a recovery are, first, the negligence of the railway company in keeping its roadbed in bad condition, which caused the injury; and second, its negligence in furnishing a defective hand car, with broken brakes, so that the same could not be controlled, and which, after plaintiff fell, ran into the car on which plaintiff had been riding, pushed it upon him, and caused his injuries.</p>
    <p id="b392-7" data-blocks='[["BL_392.6",392,[298,1419,1298,736]]]'>It appears from the testimony that the roadbed was in bad condition, but it does not appear, even from appellee’s own testimony, that such bad condition of the road caused him to fall or be thrown from the car; on the contrary, he testified that he was riding on the front end of the hand car, with his feet hanging down four inches from the ties (and they must have been almost level with the track), and he says: “ My attention was attracted by a man in a field near by, and as I was turning my head my right foot got caught by the heel, which threw me lengthways on the track.” In what way the bad condition of the roadbed could have caused his right heel to get caught, appellee did not explain. In bis written statement after the injury, and which he admits was made by his authority, he says: 1 ‘ I got a little dizzy, and my foot struck the dirt between the ties. I tried to throw myself on the outside of the rail, and got caught.” He also stated that there was no carelessness on the part of any one in the company’s employ tending to cause the accident.</p>

In the first place, all three of the hand cars and the men upon them were under the direct orders of the appellee, and if he could by the exercise of ordinary prudence have kept them <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>at a safe distance apart, so as to have avoided the injury from that source, and did not do so, he can not recover for any injury caused by the second hand car. But there is actually no testimony whatever showing any defect in the brake to the second hand car. The only testimony we have found in the record bearing upon that issue is as follows: W. D. Harvill testified: “ I was on the same car that he (appellee) was on. I was pulling. I generally rode on the second car. The man that attended to it was named Dunn. He was all the time tinkering with the brakes and oiling it up. I was in the habit of riding on it. I do not know whether it was hard to stop with the brakes or not.” * * * Question: “Did you ever examine the brakes ? ’ ’ Answer: “No, sir. ’ ’ Question: “About how often did Mr. Dunn work or tinker with the car?” Answer: “ Every few days.”</p>

    <p id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[177,972,1297,188]]]'>Thomas Smith testified: “I succeeded Mr. Denny. I saw the car afterwards; there was nothing the matter with the brakes that I know of.” Question: “ Was there much difficulty in stopping the car ?” Answer: “ The most trouble I had with it was in getting it to go.”</p>
    <p id="b393-7" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[178,1172,1299,187]]]'>Appellee having failed to show that his injury was caused by either of the alleged grounds of negligence on the part of appellant, as set out in his pleading, the judgment is not sustained by the evidence, and the court below erred in overruling appellant’s motion for a new trial.</p>

Crowder, 63 Texas, 503, Judge Stayton says: “ The true rule in this class of cases is, that the servant seeking to recover for an injury takes the burden upon himself of establishing negligence upon the part of the master and due care upon his own part.” See same case reported again in 76 Texas, 499.
