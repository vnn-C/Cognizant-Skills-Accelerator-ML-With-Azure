Smith, <em>50 </em>Texas, 369, 370, the question was one of uncertainty of description of land levied upon. The levy was upon 160 acres of land, being a part of the homestead tract of said James Bankston (defendant), exclusive of 200 acres exempt by law. It was in evidence that James Bankston pointed out the excess of his homestead tract over 200 acres, for levy, and was present at and assented to the sale. The court, on appeal, held that the levy was not so uncertain as to make it void under an ordinary execution sale, and proceed to say: “ But however it might be in case of such a levy and sale, if objected to in time by the defendant in execution, in this case it was averred and proved that the levy was made on the land as pointed out by James Bankston himself, and that he was present at and assented to the sale. The purchaser, moreover, appears to have gone into peaceable possession and remained until after Bankston’s death. These facts are sufficient to show a waiver by Bankston of any irregularities in the levy or sale;” evidently meaning the uncertainty of description, as that was the only irregularity in the sale. <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Posey%20358" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Posey 358">Id., 370</a>.</p>

Corwin has ever since the sale recognized and affirmed Nichols’ title to the land.
