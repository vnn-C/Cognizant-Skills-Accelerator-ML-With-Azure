      <em>Conclusions of Law. </em>— A sale of land under judicial process which will confer no title, and the effect of which will be to cloud the title of others, should be enjoined. But no generally accepted test, applicable to all cases, as to what will constitute such a cloud upon title as to authorize the interference for its prevention by a court of equity has ever been established, at least in this State. Elsewhere the test seems to be, where a sale, if made, would create a title under which the purchaser could in <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>ejectment recover against the true owner, unless the latter placed his own •title in evidence, or by some other means established the invalidity of the purchaser’s title, then such is a cloud on the title of the true owner. And in accordance with this test, it has been held in other States, that if an execution against a person who had once been the owner of the property be levied upon it, and it be no longer liable to levy and sale under such execution, the present owner of the property may, in equity, prevent his title being clouded by such sale. But if the title to be created by a sale <em>is </em>such that its invalidity can be determined from inspection, or that the true owner need offer no evidence to protect himself from it, then it is not a cloud on his title, and the sale will not be enjoined. See note and authorities cited to Carlin v. Hudson, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Am.%20Dec.%20524" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="62 Am. Dec. 524">62 Am. Dec., 524</a>.</p>
    <p id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[184,917,1298,541]]]'>In Carlin v. Hudson, 12 Texas, 202, it was held, that an injunction would not be granted to restrain a sale on execution of land which the judgment debtor has conveyed to the party applying for the writ, for the reason that it was not indispensable to secure him in the enjoyment of his property, or preserve his title to it, or to prevent gross and irremediable injustice in respect to such property; and that the proposed sale of the land as the property of complainant’s vendor could not operate to dispossess the plaintiff, or deprive him of its enjoyment, or defeat his title, or embarass him in the prosecution of his legal remedies for any injury to his title or possession. This decision has ever since been followed by our Supreme Court.</p>
    <p id="b275-6" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[184,1470,1298,675]]]'>In cases where the property sought to be sold under execution against the husband was a homestead, or had been dedicated as such, our courts have exercised their equitable jurisdiction at the instance of the wife, and sometimes at the instance of the husband, to restrain the sale, upon the ground that it would be a cloud upon title. In such cases, the title to the property at the time of the levy being in the name of the husband, a sale of it under execution against him would apparently vést title in the purchaser at execution sale, and it would require extrinsic evidence under such sale, which is the true principle upon which the equitable jurisdiction of courts of chancery rests, to prevent a cloud from being cast upon title to real property. And it is confined to instances where the proceeding complained of appears to be valid on its face, but is in fact void or invalid for some reason or another which can only be shown by extrinsic evidence.</p>
    <p id="b275-7" data-blocks='[["BL_275.6",275,[185,2165,1299,336]],["BL_276.1",276,[300,322,1298,136]]]'>As every person must be presumed to know the law, a proceeding which upon its face is not only illegal, but absolutely void, does not constitute a cloud upon the title to real estate against which a court of equity will relieve. And when a valid legal objection appears upon the face of the proceedings through which the adverse party claims any right to the complainant’s land, it is not in law such a cloud upon his title as will authorize a court of equity to interfere; for it is well and truly said, <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>“ That can never be considered a legal cloud which can not for a moment obstruct the unaided rays of legal science where they are brought to bear upon the supposed obscurity.”</p>
    <p id="b276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[292,471,1305,1026]]]'>It must be borne in mind that a cloud upon one’s title is the wrong that equity interposes to prevent. A cloud upon a title, though not apparently so, is always inferior to the title itself, and the holder of the real title can always, in the courts of this State, in an action of trespass to try title, brought either by himself or the party clouding his title, by the introduction of the extrinsic evidence which shows the apparent title to be only a cloud, defeat it, and maintain his right to the property by virtue of the real title. And if the fact that he can thus defeat his adversary claiming under the cloud, and maintain the right to his property by virtue of his title, should be regarded as the test of his right to maintain an action to prevent a cloud being cast upon it, the very <em>test </em>of <em>his </em>right to maintain the .action would demonstrate that such right did not exist, and prove that the equitable jurisdiction exercised by courts of chancery to prevent clouds from being cast upon titles does not obtain in this State. Such, then, can not be the test, nor be regarded as such a remedy at law as defeats the right to obtain the equitable relief. This legal remedy is essentially different, and applies to a different subject. The equitable one is to prevent the cloud from being cast, which, if done, will force the owner of the property to defend his title in an action at law, and compel the introduction on his part of extrinsic evidence to enable him to maintain his defense.</p>
    <p id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[293,1516,1300,337]]]'>Without attempting to lay down a test as to what in this State constitutes cloud upon title, we think it safe to say, that an encumbrance valid upon its face, which can only be impeached by proof of extrinsic facts, and the evidence on which the right or superior title of the complainant depends is not of record, nor shown in the papers through which the right depends, is such an encumbrance, and constitutes such a cloud upon title, in this State, as will be removed or prevented by a court of equity.</p>

Butler in Clay County, which showed the reservation of a vendor’s lien to secure the notes given for the purchase money of the land. A judgment was rendered by the District Court of Gonzales County in January, 1886, against Butler in favor of Harwood, for $1315.12, on one of said vendor’s lien notes, in which judgment the vendor’s lien was foreclosed, and the clerk directed to issue an order to sell the land in satisfaction of such judgment; and it was ordered in the judgment, that when the officer executing said order sold the land and executed his deed for the same to the purchaser, he should put him in possession of it. There was a regular chain of transfers of this judgment from Harwood to the appellee, W. B. Worsham, of which Butler had actual notice, and they <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>were filed with the papers in the case in the office of the district clerk of Gonzales County, and showed that Worsham had authority to control the judgment.</p>

B. Worsham, assignee of T. M. Harwood. It is hardly necessary to say, that if the sheriff had made the sale in pursuance of said writ, that his deed made to the purchaser by virtue of it would have been an encumbrance, valid upon its face, such as would apparently vest the purchaser with title superior to Butler’s or his vendees’, and it would have required proof of extrinsic facts to show that the title acquired under such deed was not superior to the title of Butler or that held under him.</p>

Proof of the payment of the judgment does not appear in any way from the record or papers in the case wherein it was rendered.</p>

The question then is, does the record of the release executed by Harwood on December 18, 1886, to A. L. Butler, of the vendor’s lien retained in his deed to Butler, show that the title of appellant, acquired through Butler, is superior to such a title as would be acquired by a purchaser under the order of sale sought to be enjoined ? This vendor’s lien, at the time the release was executed, had merged in the judgment which had been assigned by Harwood to Gray, and by Gray to W. B. Worsham, with the full knowledge of Butler, prior to the time the release was executed. The release makes no reference whatever to the judgment, but simply recites the payment of the vendor’s lien notes, and shows that it is made in consideration therefor. The presumption arising from said release is, that the payment of the notes was made by Butler to Harwood, and no inference can be drawn therefrom that the payment was made to Worsham. If as a matter of fact, as the presumption is from the release, the payment of the notes had been made by Butler to Harwood instead of to Worsham, such payment would not operate as a discharge of the judgment, and Worsham would be fully authorized in having an order of sale issued on it and the property sold in its satisfaction. For by the assignment of a judgment the whole right passes to the assignee, and the defendant becomes the debtor of the assignee; and after notice to the debtor, the <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>assignee will be protected from all acts of the parties. 2 Freem. on Judg., secs. 425, 426.</p>

    <p id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[292,423,1302,984]]]'>It is a very serious question in our mind, if the land had been sold by virtue of the order of sale sought to be enjoined, .if the purchaser, without other evidence of the discharge of the judgment than what appears from the release of the vendor’s lien, would not have acquired a superior title to that of the appellant. If he could be defeated in such title by the appellant, it would have to be done by proof of the extrinsic facts and evidence upon which appellant’s superior title depends, that is not of record nor shown in the papers through which his superior right depends. This evidence is the payment of the money secured by the judgment to Worsham by Butler or the Henrietta Land and Cattle Company, in the multitudinous transactions that occurred between them, and rests entirely upon paroi testimony. If for some reason such a payment could not be established, as it was on the trial of this case, in an action between the appellant and a purchaser at the sale sought to be enjoined, such purchaser would prevail in the action, and defeat the superior right of the appellant. Besides, the proposed sale, the judgment requiring the officer making it to put the purchaser in possession, might “ operate to dispossess the complainant, or deprive him of its enjoyment,” etc.; thus bringing the case within the rule of Carlin v. Hudson, which would entitle it to the injunction.</p>
