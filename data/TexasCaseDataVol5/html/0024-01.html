Railway Company — Connecting Lines — Through Bill of Lading. — In an action against a railway company for the statutory penalty for a failure to deliver goods to the consignee upon tender of the freight charges due thereon, as shown by the bill of lading, plaintiff showed that such bill was a through bill of lading; that the delivering company’s line did not reach the place of shipment, but that rates were made over its line and connecting lines <em>to </em>and from that point; that defendant company issued an expense bill, when the goods arrived, for the exact amount called for by the bill of lading, and that the car containing the goods came through from the place of shipment. <em>Held, </em>that these facts did not establish, over the sworn denial pleaded by the defendant, a contract of partnership or agency between the companies; nor, in view of the statutory provision requiring railway companies to receive and haul the cars of connecting lines, did such facts, and the further fact that the defendant finally, after the delay, accepted the amount shown by the bill of lading and delivered the goods, prove a binding ratification of the execution of the bill of lading.</p>

It contended then, and contends now, that it was not a party to the bill of lading, and it demanded as freight due 73 cents per 100 pounds, instead of 70 cents, as specified in the bill of lading. It follows that the controlling question on the trial was, whether the defendant was a party to the bill of lading.</p>

Facts, in our opinion, substantially the same as these have been held, under our statute requiring railroad companies “ for a reasonable compensation to draw over their railroad * * * the merchandise and cars which may enter and connect with their railroad” (Revised Statutes, article 4251), insufficient to justify the conclusion stated; and by this result we abide.

The bill of lading, thus providing, was read in evidence without objection on the part of appellant.

    <p id="b53-4" data-blocks='[["BL_53.5",53,[169,434,1306,884]]]'>The case made by the evidence was in any event, under defendant’s pleadings, subject to rebuttal. For this purpose, as shown by the bills of exception, the defendant on the day of trial, about 11:30 a. m., after the plaintiff had rested his case, placed a witness, C. C. Drake, upon the stand. This witness was a resident of Tarrant County, in the employ as chief clerk of the freight department of the defendant. It had secured his personal attendance upon the court. It suffices to say, without repeating it, that the testimony of the witness thus offered by the defendant was in every material respect in substantiation of the averments already set out of the special answer. As he was about to testify, the witness was taken suddenly ill to such an extent as to necessitate his leaving the court house. The defendant’s counsel being unable to assure the court when he would sufficiently recover to proceed with his testimony, the court refused a postponement. At 1:30 p. m. of the same day, after the plaintiff’s attorney had made his opening argument, the witness having sufficiently recovered, was again tendered by the defendant, with the request that his testimony be heard. This the court refused, as we think, erroneously.</p>
    <p id="b53-5" data-blocks='[["BL_53.6",53,[170,1331,1305,235]]]'>In our opinion, sufficient diligence had been shown to secure the testimony. The necessity for issuing a subpoena, had the witness resided in the county, was obviated by his personal attendance, and the taking of his deposition as a nonresident would have been but the substitute for his personal attendance, which could not be enforced by subpoena.</p>
    <p id="b53-6" data-blocks='[["BL_53.7",53,[171,1579,1305,427]]]'>The evidence was obviously most material. It is strikingly similar to that recited in the opinion, and evidently approved as constituting a defense, in Railway v. Williams, 77 Texas, 125. We think the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, should have permitted the defendant to supply the omission in its testimony caused by the sickness of its witness. 1 Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 1298. As the refusal was excepted to at the time, and was made the ground of a motion for a new trial, and is here assigned as error, we conclude that the judgment of the court must be reversed and the cause remanded. It is so ordered.</p>
