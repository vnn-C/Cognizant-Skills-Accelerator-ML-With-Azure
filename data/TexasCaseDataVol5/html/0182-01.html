Book 70 was labeled “ deed records of Travis County,” and in the book were recorded deeds to land transfers, mechanic’s liens, and other instruments. Said instruments were also recorded by the same clerk on October 30, 1889, in book 90, which was a book kept exclusively for recording mechanic’s liens.</p>
    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[292,769,1302,435]]]'>The lumber and material were furnished for the erection of the improvements as agreed in the contract. The impovements were erected on lots 9 and 10 in block 2. The house, a two-story frame, was placed 7-¡-feet on lot 9 and 16-J feet on lot 10, both lots being at the time of the contract the property, and are now the property, of the defendants; which lots, at the time of their purchase, were designated by them as their homestead; “and they have continuously used and occupied the lots 9 and 10, block 2, and the improvements erected thereon, as their homestead since their completion.”</p>
    <p id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[289,1216,1303,584]]]'>Defendant Robert J. Grant told the contractor to build the house so as to protect and save a certain tree. His wife was sick, and knew nothing about the placing of the house. He, Grant, was on the ground when he bought lot 9, and knew its lines and looked at them. He was not very careful where the house was placed, as he fully expected to pay for the lumber, and he did not positively know until about two years before the trial that the house was not all on lot 9, and not until threatened with a foreclosure of the mechanic’s lien on the premises did he make it known to the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs did not know how much of the dwelling was on lot 9 and how much on lot 10 until an official survey was made. Mrs. Grant did not know until about two years before the trial that the most of the improvements were on lot 10.</p>

Grant only, foreclosing the mechanic’s lien as to both defendants on lot 9 only and the improvements thereon, ordering sale of the same, and execution for any balance due after applying proceeds of sale to the judgment against Robert J. Grant. Plaintiffs have appealed.</p>

Errors were assigned raising these questions, <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>and also that, at least, they should have had a foreclosure on the improvements placed on lot 10 as well as on lot 9.</p>

      <em>Opinion. </em>— It is unnecessary to follow the assignments of error in their order. We will state our conclusions of the rights of the parties, as they occur to us, upon the foregoing facts, raised by the assignments.</p>
    <p id="b211-6" data-blocks='[["BL_211.5",211,[171,612,1300,137]]]'>1. The particular description of land upon which the lien was given in the contract must prevail over the general description, and therefore it must be held that there was no lien by contract upon lot 10.</p>

The lien upon the improvements is distinct from that on the lot, and while it may not apply to more than lot 9, it will apply to all the improvements placed upon the homestead.</p>

It was also held that the lien in favor of the material man upon the improvements would be superior to a former mortgage upon the land. Turner v. Robins, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20Ala.%20593" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="78 Ala. 593">78 Ala., 593</a>.</p>

On like principle, a lien may be created by statute on the improvements, without its extension to the realty. There is in this respect no inseparable connection between the buildings and the land.”</p>
    <p id="b211-12" data-blocks='[["BL_211.10",211,[174,1856,1300,290]]]'>The same doctrine was again held by the same court upon the single proposition, that when the description of the land, the “ one acre” upon which the mechanic’s lien could attach, was indefinite, whereby the lien could not be enforced upon the land, still it could be established against the structure or improvements.

Peters, <a href="/ala/79/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="79 Ala. 133" data-case-ids="3188661" data-case-paths="/ala/79/0133-01">79 Ala., 133</a>; Lane <em>&amp; </em>Bodley Co. v.
