    <p id="b342-9" data-blocks='[["BL_342.12",342,[297,2317,1298,128]]]'>The character of bond required by law, in so far as it affects a recovery by the State for the use of the county, is undoubtedly penal in its nature, and can not be otherwise construed.</p>

There is a class of bonds that may well be sustained from their form and structure without the aid of any statute: injunction bonds, bail bonds, replevy bonds, forthcoming bonds, appeal and writ of error bonds, and all such as are <em>made payable to the beneficiary </em>or the interested party; they would be valid at common law without resorting to the statute to give them effect as such.” In that case there was a suit for damages against a ferryman upon his bond which was required to be given by him in order to procure his license. It must be borne in mind in this case that the <em>act </em>for which the penalty is sought is not an act denounced by this statute as an offense, and for which the penalty of $500 is prescribed; but it is made one of the conditions of the bond,11 that he or they will not rent or let any part of the house * * * to any person or persons for the purpose of running or conducting any game or games prohibited by the laws of the State;” hence the penalty must be recovered under the bond, or not at all.</p>
