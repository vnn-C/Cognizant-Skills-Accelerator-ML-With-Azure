      <em>Conclusions of Law. </em>— The defendants, in their answer, simply alleged the existence, within the limits of Bexar County, of certain duly established roads. There were no allegations as to any proceedings in the County Commissioners Court; and as the special exceptions to the answer erroneously assume the averment of proceedings in said court, they have no application to the answer. The defendants, by their answer, were not restricted to showing that the roads were established by proceedings in the County Commissioners Court; but could show that they were established by grant, prescription, dedication, limitation, by order of court, or in any other lawful way. As suggested by counsel for defendants in error in his brief, if plaintiff had specially excepted to defendants’ answer because it fails to set out in what manner said roads became public, then the question might arise whether the general allegation of the public highway is sufficiently certain under the rules of pleading. But as the exceptions are to matter which does not appear in the answer, and do not relate to it, they are not well taken, and were properly overruled by the court below.</p>
