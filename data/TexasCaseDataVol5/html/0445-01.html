In Texas, where an attachment is taken out for the purpose of reaching the property of a nonresident and subjecting it to the payment of his debts, the essential jurisdictional fact is the seizure of the res. This is in this case a constructive seizure, and consists in the issuance, levy, and return of a formal writ of attachment. By statute the publication of citation is also rendered jurisdictional, the statute declaring no judgment shall be rendered unless such publication has been made. When these two requisites concur, this jurisdiction has attached. The affidavit is a mere preliminary to the issuance of the writ; defects therein are defects in orderly procedure; but the defendant, through the seizure of his property, being before the court, such defects will not subject the judgment to any other than a direct attack.

    <p id="AdA" data-blocks='[["BL_473.8",473,[157,1066,1297,736]]]'>The suit of Todd v. Barelli was brought in January, 1876. It was upon a judgment obtained by Todd against the defendant in that suit in one of the District Courts of New Orleans, in Louisiana. The petition averred that the defendant resided in Louisiana; it set out the cause of action, and alleged that the defendant, John C. Barelli, was indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $4196.37, and concluded as follows: “ Petitioner further avers, that the said John C. Barelli has property situated in Victoria County, out of which he believes a portion of this debt can be made; wherefore petitioner sues and prays that the said John C. Barelli be cited by publication to appear and answer hereto at the next term of your honorable court for the county of Victoria, and that upon final trial petitioner have judgment for his said debt, with interest and for all costs of suit; and petitioner further prays, that a writ of attachment may issue, directing the sheriff of Victoria County to seize so much of the property of the said John C. Barelli as will pay the debt aforesaid,” etc.</p>
    <p id="b473-6" data-blocks='[["BL_473.9",473,[159,1815,1295,378]]]'>The petition was sworn to by A. H. Phillips, one of the attorneys for the plaintiff, and, with the affidavit of the attorney to the petition, forms the only affidavit made in the case. Following the petition is the affidavit: “ I do solemnly swear, that the matters set forth, in the foregoing petition are true, and that John C. Barelli, the defendant named in the foregoing petition, is justly indebted to Samuel M. Todd, the plaintiff named in the foregoing petition, in the sum of $4196.37, and that the said Barelli is not a resident of Texas.”</p>

    <p id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[314,819,1295,540]]]'>We are of the opinion that the judgment in the case of Todd v. Barelli was not void on account of the defect in the affidavit, and consequently not subject to a collateral attack in this action of trespass to try title. That the defendant is a nonresident is made by the statute one of the grounds for an attachment; and the proceedings in the attachment suit showed that the judgment rendered, if not free from error, was certainly not void, but at most only erroneous, if the question is to be determined by the statute of our State then in force, because the act regulating attachments provided that every original attachment issued without affidavit taken as required should be abated on motion of the defendant.

Good bar, White <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Bank, 78 Texas, 461. That the act was intended to apply as well to cases where the property of a nonresident has been attached, if there could be any question as to that, is made clear by the eighteenth section, which declares, 1 ‘ That no judgment shall be rendered in suits by attachment unless the citation or summons has been served in the ordinary mode or by publication in the manner provided by law.” Pasch. Dig., art. 156. In accordance with the procedure in this State, the attachment of the property of the defendant and citation to him by publication conferred jurisdiction upon the court to subject the property to the satisfaction of the plaintiff’s demand by sale thereof; and the affidavit was not a jurisdictional fact, so as to preclude the court having general jurisdiction of the subject matter from adjudicating its sufficiency to support a writ, fair on its face, which has been levied upon the property. Is this procedure due process of law, such as is necessary for a State court to take in subjecting the property of a nonresident, situated within the limits of the State, to a demand that may be established by its judgment ?</p>

These decisions are not confined to <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>proceedings in rem where the property of a nonresident is sought to be subjected to a demand asserted in a State court, but extend to cases of ordinary attachment, when the defendant has appeared and pleaded. But on the other hand, it is held, with better reason, we think, that the attachment of the property and bringing it into the custody of the law is the fact that gives the court jurisdiction of the property of a nonresident, and that citation to the defendant, as required by our statute, is not necessary, unless otherwise provided by the procedure of the State whose court has caused the property to be attached. The question has been definitely settled in this way by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wallace, 319, and Mathews v. Dinsmore, 109 United States, 216.
