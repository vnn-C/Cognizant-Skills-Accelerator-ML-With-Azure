Lenox, one of the defendants in error, brought suit in the County Court of Bowie County against M. J. and S. C. Wood, plaintiffs in error, to recover of them 8423.52, and to foreclose a mortgage upon certain property therein described. A writ of sequestration was issued and levied upon same. In January,' 1889, the court house of Bowie County was destroyed by fire, and afterwards the attorney for the Woods informed Lenox that the papers in the case had been destroyed by said fire.</p>

The papers were at that time delivered to Lenox’s attorneys, and kept by them until the July Term, and were brought into court at that time by order of the court. At said term a change of venue was granted at the instance of the Woods, and the cause was transferred to the District Court of Cass County, the County Court of said county having been abolished. The attorneys of Lenox had notice of the motion to change venue. After the case reached the District Court of Cass County, the Woods, by leave of court, amended their answer, and reconvened for damages for the wrongful seizure of their property, the amount claimed being $2355. The Woods demanded a jury, paid the fee, and had the case put on the jury docket. By agreement of counsel, the case was set for trial September 11, 1889. On that day the case was regularly reached on call of the docket. Lenox and his attorneys failed to appear. The case was withdrawn from the jury, and a judgment was rendered against Lenox and his sureties on sequestration bond for $1055, the value of the property seized. Lenox, as he claims, on account of delicate health and under the advice of his physician, in May of that year left for Europe, and remained away until after said judgment was rendered.</p>

We have carefully examined the record, and have been unable to detect any fraud in the proceedings that led up to the judgment. Counsel of defendants in error in their brief fail to point to any fact or circumstance showing that any fraud had been perpetrated in the procurement of said judgment. Then we take it that fraud is eliminated from the transaction, and on that ground Lenox is not entitled to relief. No accident is claimed, unless the delicate health of Lenox can be so termed. He claims that he was in such a state of health that he was advised by his physician to take a trip to Europe, which he proceeded to do, being gone about five months, leaving his case to the tender care of his-adversary. The evidence of Lenox shows that he had been in delicate-health for sometime, but sufficiently able to look after this case. Being-able so to do, he can not excuse himself for not making some provision by which his interest could have been protected. No witnesses were subpoenaed ; no depositions were taken, not even his own. As far as the record shows, no effort was made to get an agreement from opposing counsel to postpone the cause or make any disposition of it until Lenox could return. In fact, the whole case seems to have been totally ignored by Lenox.</p>

It seems that this information was incorrect, and the papers were produced in court at the April Term thereof and given to Lenox’s attorney. This was several weeks before Lenox left for Europe. The counsel should have looked after the matter, and if he failed, then he is to blame; and Lenox, as far as Woods is concerned, must suffer the consequences. Eddleman v. McGlathery, 74 Texas, 281.</p>
    <p id="b349-7" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[179,2019,1296,488]],["BL_350.2",350,[291,320,1300,536]]]'>The evidence shows that the statement of the attorney for the Woods about the records being burned was a mistake. But suppose it had been true, would it have excused Lenox from prosecuting his suit ? Certainly not. He had invoked the aid of the law to assist him in the collection of a debt. At his instance, it had reached forth its strong arm and laid hold of property belonging to the Woods, in value exceeding double the amount of his debt, for the purpose of securing his claim. He had resorted to a harsh remedy. True, it is sanctioned by the law; but when resorted to, it is done at the peril of the actor, and if he is not diligent in its prosecution he must suffer the consequences. If the records had been destroyed, the <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>law provides an ample remedy by substitution, by which he could, without much delay, have pursued the collection of his claim without unnecessary injury to the Woods. If Lenox did not see proper to look into the matter, or did not care to substitute the lost record, he could not excuse himself for that reason, for the Woods had the right to substitute the records, and it is unreasonable to suppose that they would lie still and await the pleasure of Lenox to prosecute the suit when there was property belonging to them tied up by the suit, in value more than double Lenox’s debt. Even if they knew that Lenox’s claim was just, it would have been to their interest to have had the matter settled as soon as possible, that they might get the use of the surplus fund.</p>

There is neither fraud, accident, nor mistake that shows any equitable grounds which entitle him to relief at the hand of the court. His injury, if any, was caused solely by his own negligence. This being the case, he must suffer the consequences.</p>
