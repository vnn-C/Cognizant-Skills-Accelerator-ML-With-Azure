Appellant also admitted in his answer that he purchased the carload of onions from appellee at the time charged by him in his petition, but alleged that they were purchased under a contract which he averred was similar in every respect to the one by which he purchased the cabbages; and that when they arrived in San <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>Antonio they were in a bad and unmerchantable condition.

      <em>Conclusions of Law. </em>— Where goods are sold by dealers to dealers, there is no implied warranty as to their quality arising out of the ultimate intention that the goods shall be consumed as food. Lukens v. Freiund, <a href="/kan/27/0664-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="27 Kan. 664" data-case-ids="611207" data-case-paths="/kan/27/0664-01">27 Kans., 664</a>; Howard v. Emerson, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20Mass.%20321" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="110 Mass. 321">110 Mass., 321</a>; Moses v. Mead, <a href="/denio/1/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Denio 378" data-case-ids="483905" data-case-paths="/denio/1/0378-01">1 Denio, 378</a>. Therefore there was no warranty on appellee’s part at the time the goods were sold and delivered as to their quality or condition. Their condition or unfitness for market was not put in issue by either appellant’s denial or special plea. It could only have been put in issue by a plea of fraud, alleging that at the time of sale and shipment that appellee knew that they were unsound and unfit for market. This issue not <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>being made, it was immaterial in the case whether the goods were sound and marketable at the time of sale and shipment or not. The only issue made by the pleadings was, whether appellee, at the time the cabbages and onions were sold to appellant, warranted they should arrive in good, sound, and merchantable condition in San Antonio; and the correctness of the court’s rulings as to the admission or rejection of testimony, as well as the correctness of its charge, must be determined in view of this issue.</p>
    <p id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[288,728,1304,736]]]'>It is assigned as error, that the court erred in admitting in evidence, over appellant’s objection, copies of certain letters purported to have been written by appellee to appellant in regard to the subject matter of the controversy, upon the ground that the originals were the best evidence. It appears that the original letters were at the time of the trial in the possession of appellant at his office in the city of San Antonio, where the trial occurred, and that he was notified by appellee’s counsel on the trial to produce them, and that he had time and opportunity to so produce them before the copies were read in evidence; the copies had been on file with the papers sometime, and had been read in evidence upon a former trial without objection. Appellant might have reasonably anticipated that they would be offered in evidence again, and was prepared to produce originals, and would have doubtless "done so if they would have been to his advantage. Under these circumstances we think secondary evidence was admissible.</p>
    <p id="b592-6" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[287,1475,1302,686]]]'>It has been seen that the only issue made by the pleadings in this case was whether appellee, at the time the cabbages and onions were sold to appellant, warranted they should arrive at San Antonio in good, sound, and merchantable condition. It was not plead in defense that they were not in such condition when shipped from San Francisco. If there was any question about their condition when they arrived in San Antonio, it would have been permissible to prove they were not in good condition at the time of shipment, for the purpose of establishing, under appellant’s special plea, their condition- when they reached San Antonio. The uncontradicted testimony shows that when they arrived at their destination their condition was not good and merchantable. Hence the testimony of the witnesses offered as experts to prove by circumstances that their condition could not have been good when shipped, was immaterial and not pertinent, and it was not error to exclude it.</p>
    <p id="b592-7" data-blocks='[["BL_592.6",592,[290,2172,1298,338]],["BL_593.1",593,[189,324,1300,131]]]'>The appellant offered to prove by several witnesses, that the reputation of S. Antolde, a witness for appellee, who had for years resided in San Antonio, but who for the last four years prior to the trial had resided in California, for truth and veracity in San Antonio, Texas, was bad when he lived in said city. It seems from Mynatt v. Hendson, 66 Texas, 67, that the credibility of a witness may be impeached in this way. But in this case the only fact testified to by Antolde was the condition of the <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>goods at the time of shipment, and as his evidence was on an immaterial issue, it was a matter of no importance in the case whether he testified to the truth or not.</p>
    <p id="b593-3" data-blocks='[["BL_593.4",593,[189,474,1300,729]]]'>The goods were sold by plaintiff through his broker, G. Lewis. The court instructed the jury, that “ If they believed from the evidence that Lewis was unauthorized to warrant the produce to be sound and in good marketable condition on its arrival in San Antonio, and defendant knew said agent’s want of authority to make such warranty, it could not be binding on plaintiff; and the defendant could not recover for the breach, even though the warranty was made by the agent while acting in the usual scope of his authority.” This part of the charge is assigned as error, upon the ground, that if the warranty was made by the agent, it was binding upon the principal after he elected to confirm the contract. There was no evidence that appellee ever, with knowledge of an unauthorized warranty by his agent, elected to confirm the contract. All the evidence was the other way. In the absence of knowledge on the part of the principal that his agent has exceeded his authority, there can be no ratification of his unauthorized act.</p>
    <p id="b593-4" data-blocks='[["BL_593.5",593,[190,1223,1300,437]]]'>The charge of the court did not, perhaps, present the issue to the jury as clearly as it might have; but wherein it failed to do so was upon the measure of damages in the event the contract should be found to be such as was pleaded by appellant. As that issue was determined against appellant, the error, if any, was wholly immaterial. The charge did clearly present the issue upon which the jury found their verdict, and in view of its finding, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether the charge on the measure of damages was correct upon the hypothesis that the contract was such as pleaded by appellant.</p>

A general denial will not avail him, although the plaintiff may have needlessly alleged facts which, if proved, would show compliance with a warranty. In this case no implied warranty is claimed, nor is any fraudulent conduct on the part of plaintiff alleged in the delivery of the goods, either of which would have afforded defendant like ground for redress, and are subject to the same rules of pleading when sought to be used. Nor is there anything in defendant’s pleadings — as, for instance, an allegation that the produce was sold and bought directly for consumption— from which a warranty would necessarily be implied. On the contrary, an express warranty is alleged by the defendant to have been given, viz., that the goods should be delivered in good condition in San Antonio, which of course would involve their being in good condition when shipped, and this view of the case clearly excludes the existence of an implied warranty. The verdict of the jury in this case, to whom was submitted the issue concerning the express warranty, was a finding against such warranty having been made; and as stated by this court in its opinion, this event renders immaterial errors the court may have committed in respect to testimony concerning the condition of the goods in California when shipped. We see no reason to reverse the conclusion arrived at in our opinion rendered in this case. The question concerning jurisdiction has no merit.</p>
