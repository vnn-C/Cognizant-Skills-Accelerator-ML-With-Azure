      <em>Conclusions of Law. </em>— It sufficiently appears that the application for the order of sale, the order of sale, the report of sale, and order confirming it, relate to the headright certificate of Mathew C. Patton for a league and labor of land; and when all are taken and construed together, they are amply sufficient to identify the certificate; and the recitation in the patent shows that said certificate was located on the land in controversy. Hurly v. Barnard, 48 Texas, 88; Davis v. Touchstone, 45 Texas, 490; Robertson v. Johnson, 57 Texas, 64.</p>
    <p id="b232-9" data-blocks='[["BL_232.8",232,[305,1460,1297,934]]]'>The patent to the land having issued on April 24, 1855, and the sale of the certificate, though made, as shown by the administrator’s report, on the first Tuesday in March, not having been confirmed by the court until the 6th of May, it becomes important to determine at what time the title passed, if at all, by virtue of the sale of the certificate. After a certificate is located it ceases to be personalty, but is merged in and becomes a part of the realty. Hearne v. Gillett, 62 Texas, 25; Simpson v. Chapman, 45 Texas, 566; Adams v. Railway, 70 Texas, 275. We can not presume, in the absence of evidence, that when the Probate Court ordered the sale the certificate had been located, but must presume that it had not, for the court would not have ordered the sale of personalty after it ceased to exist as such. The rule seems to be, that a sale made by an administrator or other functionary by order of and under authority of a court, is not complete and confers no rights until confirmed. But when confirmation is made by the court, though subsequent to the day of the sale, it relates back to the <em>date of the sale, </em>if the date of sale is made to appear, and carries title from that date.

Cooper, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20Am.%20Dec.%20737" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="34 Am. Dec. 737">supra,</a> was brought by Cooper against John Taylor, administrator of the estate of Peter Dyerle, for rents on <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>certain lands belonging to Dyerle which were ordered sold by the administrator on a credit of six, twelve, and eighteen months. On January 10, 1835, the land was sold under the decree to Cooper, who gave his bond for the purchase money. At the time of the sale the land was rented, and the tenant paid the rent, amounting to $200, to the administrator, notwithstanding Cooper had notified him not to pay it. The sale was afterwards confirmed. Judgment was given in Cooper’s favor against the administrator. Judge Tucker, in rendering the opinion of the court, said: “ I have not the slightest doubt of the right of Cooper to the rent in question. * * * Where the sale is confirmed — that is, where both contracting parties (the purchaser and the court) concur in ratifying the inchoate purchase — the confirmation relates back to the sale, and the purchaser is entitled to everything he would have been entitled to if the confirmation and conveyance of title had been contemporaneous with the sale.” In the case before us the court ordered the certificate to be sold at a certain time, place, and manner, and on terms specified in the order. The report of the sale by the administrator shows on its face a strict compliance with the order, and the confirmation by the court relates to and sanctions what was done in obedience to and under its authority, and its effect was as though its confirmation and the act confirmed were contemporaneous. Thereupon the title to the certificate vested in M. T. C. Patton on the first Tuesday in March, 1855, and the right to locate and acquire land by virtue of it. Cox v. Bray, 28 Texas, 261. When the patent issued by virtue of the certificate, it enured to the benefit of and vested title in the assignee. But appellants say that the title is an equitable one only (it is), and that appellees’ demand is stale, and therefore they can not recover on it. When a recovery is sought against strangers to the title, who are trespassers without color of title, and who show no connection with the legal title, as in this case, and the time they had been in possession, if at all, does not appear, the defense of stale demand is unavailing to defeat the right of recovery.
