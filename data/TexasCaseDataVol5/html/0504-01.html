Land Certificate — Duplicate — Ratification of Unauthorized Survey. — S., a nonresident, owned as assignee a duplicate land certificate, which, without his knowledge or authority, was located in It. county in 1877, the field notes of the survey reciting that it was “ made for D. N. T., assignee.” In 1873, some one falsely pretending to be agent for another person as owner of the duplicate, filed in the General Land Office a showing to the effect that such duplicate had been lost, and thereupon procured the issuance of another duplicate, which, without the knowledge or authority of S., was located in W. county in 1874. Upon both surveys coming to the knowledge of S., he ratified the one made in W. county, and filed in the Land Office a protest against the issuance of any patent upon the other. <em>Held, </em>that the right of S. to the land in W. county could not be prejudiced by the location in K. county, and was superior to a subsequent adverse location made thereon under other certificates.</p>

By the law then in force (Paschal’s Digest, articles- 4574-4576), if the certificate was located it could not be floated; it became a part of the land, a chattel real. If in conflict, and the surveyor or his deputy would give the certificate to that effect, it might be floated or lifted, unless the entry was made upon appropriated land, evidenced by surveyors’, County Court, or Land Office record; and in that event, the applicant must stay and -fight the prior appropriation, and if it was good, his certificate was forfeited by the judgment of the court. Therefore he could float his certificate for only one reason, and that was when it was in conflict with an older survey, which was not shown by the records of the surveyor, County Court, or Land Office.</p>

The land being then public domain, was again appropriated by a valid alternate certificate, and the school section sold to two of these defendants.</p>

The testimony of the Land Commissioner was explicit, that duplicate number 108 had been located in Kimble County, May 19,- 1877, which was long after this duplicate had been lost and substituted by duplicate number issued October 23, 1867; and that the location in Wilbarger County, from which this suit arose, had been made September 10, 1874, under duplicate yyh, issued upon proof of loss of duplicate ¿--j- as a substitute therefor, March 7, 1873.</p>

      <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>There was no evidence that appellant caused the location in Kimble County to be <em>made; </em>but on the contrary, the <em>evidence </em>tended to show that he' had nothing to do with it, except to protest, through his agent, against the issuance of patent thereon. The corrected field notes of this survey recite that it was made for D. N. Terrill, assignee. The patent was afterwards cancelled by the Land Commissioner, of his own motion, on the ground of the supposed invalidity of the original certificate. Under these circumstances, we think this location should not prejudice appellant’s prior location of the land in dispute, which, though made without his personal knowledge, was ratified by him, while the subsequent location was rejected.</p>
    <p id="b533-5" data-blocks='[["BL_533.4",533,[165,869,1305,486]]]'>There was error also in the conclusion that appellant, plaintiff below, could not recover because he had failed to prove that the land in controversy had been surveyed within twelve months from the date of his entry or application for said land. As this survey was made prior to 1879, the law required no written application to be made. Possession by the surveyor of the certificate was sufficient. The return of the field notes, with the duplicate certificate, to the General Land Office within twelve months after the survey was made, and prior to the inception of appellees’ rights, furnished sufficient evidence of a location prima facie valid, provided the duplicate certificate itself was also valid.</p>
    <p id="b533-6" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[167,1367,1303,386]]]'>This brings us to the most important question in the case, whether appellant made out a prima facie case of a valid certificate. If he did, the proof relied on to rebut it was not, in our opinion, sufficient to deprive him of a recovery against a subsequent locator. While a prior locator who has not secured a patent to the land must show a valid certificate and survey in order to recover, we understand the rule to be, that, like any other plaintiff, he is only required in the first instance to make out a prima facie case, and not to exclude all possible defects in his title.</p>

This proof consisted of the certificate of the publisher, accompanying a printed advertisement of the loss, etc., to the effect that the publication had been made for sixty days, on file in the Land Office since about 1872 or 1873, which certificate showed a substantial compliance with the statute, except that it was <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>not sworn to. The Commissioner seems to have been satisfied of its truth, as manifested by his issuance of the duplicate. The evident purpose of the statute was to furnish evidence for his action; and if in fact the requisite publication was made, as we think should be inferred, in the absence of further showing, the statute was substantially complied with.</p>

It also appears that duplicate number 108 was at one time located in Jack County, and the survey forfeited for nonreturn of the certificate by July 29, 1872. It does not appear at whose instance these locations were made. Appellant had no personal knowledge of them, but from time to time had several agents in the State, he being all the time a nonresident. It further appears that no land has ever been patented, except as shown above, by virtue of the original William Wentworth head-right or any of its duplicates.

If during the life of duplicate 108 it was thus tied to a survey of land by being located and returned to the Land Office, and afterwards withdrawn without statutory authority, its career was ended, and no further duplicates could be lawfully issued.
