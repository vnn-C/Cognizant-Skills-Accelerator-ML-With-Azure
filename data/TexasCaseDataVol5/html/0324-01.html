It was not till the adoption of the Con<a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>stitution of 1869 that the statute of limitation was suspended from the 28th day of January, 1861, to the 30th day of March, 1870. The object of the Constitution of 1869 was merely to prevent the suspended period from being taken into account in the computation of the time required by the statute to bar an action, and was not to restore a disability that had already been removed, or to allow the tacking of disabilities so as to furnish protection for an indefinite time to a party against whom the statute had once begun to run.</p>

This testimony was objected to, as shown by the bill of exceptions, because it was irrelevant, did not show a transfer of William F. Patterson’s interest in the certificate, and because the other evidence showed that he was a minor.</p>

In view of the fact that the effect of this testimony has been once passed upon by the Supreme Court, in the case of Harvey v. Carroll, 72 Texas, 65, upon a former appeal, unless there was other testimony supporting it on this trial, it might have been properly excluded. It was weak, indefinite, and not sufficient, either on the theory of a sale or paroi gift. If there was a reliquishment in writing, it should have been introduced in evidence, or its absence accounted for. If a paroi sale or gift was relied <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>■upon, the facts should have been definitely shown bringing it within the rule in such cases.

Carroll, Sr., bought 160 acres of the land in controversy, placed his deed on record, and improved and occupied the land, and that it has ever since been occupied by him and his heirs and vendees. Mrs. Harvey was married to her co-plaintiff, H. T. Harvey, November 26, 1867. In 1864 the 225 acres tract was bought under deeds duly recorded, and it has been improved and ever since held by a portion of the defendants and their vendors.</p>

This evidence is not disputed by appellants; but they claim that at the time of such purchase and occupancy, and also at the time of the marriage of Mrs. Harvey, on November 26, 1867, the statute of limitation was suspended in Texas, and hence the statute never began to run against her. This position is not tenable. The testimony of Mrs. Harvey shows that she was a minor up to the time of her marriage in 1867. At the time of such marriage the statute of limitation was not suspended, and it was not until the adoption of the Constitution of 1869 that the statute of limitation was suspended from the 28th day of January, 1861, to the 30th day of March, 1870; and while the courts have been liberal in extending this suspension, for all causes of action, over that period, they have never extended it so far as to allow one disability to be tacked to another. At the time of the possession and improvement of this 225 acres of land in 1864, Mrs. Harvey was a minor, and no limitation could run against her until her marriage in 1867, but it then began. In the case of Ragsdale v. Barnes, 68 Texas, 504, the minor feme sole had married in 1868. The lot was sold and the vendee went into possession in 1863. The court said: “It is clear that if there had been no suspension of the statute of limitation, it would have commenced to run against her upon her marriage in 1868, and she would have been barred long before the institution of this suit. But it is contended that because the Constitution of 1869 provided that the statute should be suspended from the 28th day of January, 1861, until the acceptance of that Constitution by Congress, therefore there was no law of limitation in force at the time of appellant’s marriage, and hence that when the suspension ceased the disability of coverture also attached and protected her against the bar of the statute. But in this view we do not concur. In the first place, it is to be borne in mind that during the year 1868 the laws of limitation were in full force (section 6 of Ordinance 11 of 1866, Sayles’ Constitution, 343); and that upon appellant’s marriage the statute began to run against her. White v. Latimer, 12 Texas, 62. The object of the provision of the Con<a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>stitution of 1869 was merely to prevent the suspended period from being taken into account in the computation of the time required by the statute to bar an action, and was not to restore a disability that had already been removed.” Pages 505, 506. The above opinion of Judge Gaines so clearly presents our views, that further elaboration seems unnecessary.</p>
