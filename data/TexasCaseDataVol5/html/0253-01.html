Franklin related only to such land as their deceased brother Elijah “ was entitled to receive from the Government of Texas for services rendered as a soldier in the army of said Government.” It applied to the 1200 acres bounty and the 640 acres donation warrants, for the deceased was entitled to these for his services as such soldier. But it did not affect the one-third league certificate, for he could not have been entitled to it for services as a soldier, for certificates for that quantity of land were never issued by the Government for military services.</p>

Bailey and her husband being resident citizens of the State of Virginia, where the common law of descent and distribution then obtained, when the right to such certificates descended to her it passed to her husband by virtue of the laws of said State. Therefore the husband was the proper party to sign the power of attorney, and his wife’s signature to it was not necessary. Hillv. Townsend, 24 Texas, 581; Schoul. on Dom.Rel.,sec. 82..</p>
    <p id="b285-9" data-blocks='[["BL_285.8",285,[182,1775,1301,537]]]'>3. The power of attorney of October 23 authorized Thomas J. Franklin to take all lawful means for the recovery of the lands, to appoint attorneys, and in the event of his receiving a patent, to sell the land. As such power, it carried with it as an incident all the powers that were necessary to carry out the powers directly conferred; and as it was necessary in order to obtain patents to procure the certificates and have them located, the authority to contract with a suitable person to procure and locate them, as well as to pay him for his services therefor in the usual manner, was necessarily implied; and the power conferred on R. A. Gillespie by Thomas J. Franklin by the instrument of April 8, 1839, was, authorized by his principals in their power of attorney to him.</p>

In order to maintain the defense under the ten years statute of limitations, the defendant must prove actual, exclusive, continuous, visiible, and notorious possession, distinct and hostile, for the full period of ten years.

Franklin under his power of attorney, therein referred to, was, first, to vest, when located, in William F. Gillespie all the interest that he and the grantors in his power had in the 1280 and 640-acre surveys which should be located by virtue of warrants issued to Elijah B. Franklin for services as a soldier in the army of Texas; second, to declare an equitable title in R. A. Gillespie to one-half of said surveys, and to vest the title of the said Gillespie’s one-half interest in William F. Gillespie in trust for said equitable owner; third, the said declaration being made by an authorized agent acting within the scope of his authority, was binding on his principals, and being included in the deed, had the same effect as though it was a separate instrument declaring the trust; fourth, Thomas J. Franklin being of the half blood, had no interest in the one-third league survey, and it not being included in his power of attorney, no title to any part of it passed by virtue of said deed, and the declaration in the deed which showed R. A. Gillespie’s equity in the other two surveys did not affect it. Bracken v. Jones, 63 Texas, 184; Murphy v. Welder, 58 Texas, 239.</p>

Gillespie, the patentees holding the land in trust for them; and such equitable title having been asserted and acted on for thirty years, and the holders of the legal title not having repudiated the trust until this suit was instituted, the appellees’ equitable demand was not stale, but could be asserted against and was superior to the legal title.
