Windsor Bobinson and others, being the owners of the south half of section 18 and the north half of section 64 of block 12 of the Houston <em>&amp; </em>Texas Central Bailway Company surveys in Wilbarger County, undertook to divide it into lots, blocks, and streets suitable for a town thereon, but made a mistake as to the location of their east line, and surveyed a portion of their town on the land of their neighbors on the east, and left an equal amount of their own undivided on the west. This was a strip 366 varas wide. After this, and before the mistake was discovered, Bobinson and his associates executed to J. Doan, as county judge of Wilbarger County, their bond for title, by which they agreed to convey to him and his successors in office, for the use of said county, 130 of the lots, being two front and two rear lots in each of the even numbered blocks of said town laid off as aforesaid, so soon as patent should be obtained from the State therefor.</p>

Doan, county judge of Wilbarger County, Texas, and his successors in office, for the use and benefit of said county, all of our right, title, and interest in and to block 4 for court house; block 51 for a jail; also, in and to the following described lots and parcels of land being situated in the town of Vernon, in said county, as follows, to-wit, two front and two rear lots in every even numbered block, as is shown by the town plat of said town now on record in the county clerk’s office of said county, to which reference is hereby made for a more particular description as follows.” Then follows a description of the lots convejmd, by numbers, making 130 in all, and concludes with the covenant of general warranty of title.</p>

A part of the lots conveyed to appellant were in that part of the town laid off east of the land owned by Bobinson and his associates, and its title thereto having therefore failed, it seeks in this case to have compensation out of the 366 varas strip that was left undivided as above set forth.</p>
