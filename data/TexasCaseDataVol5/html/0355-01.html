On January 27, 1893, the Laclede National Bank of St. Louis recovered judgment against W. J. Betterton and C. L. Betterton, makers, and the Ninth National Bank of Dallas, endorser, of a promissory note for $6525.50, interest and costs. Bettertons filed motion for new trial, which was overruled February 27, 1893, they giving notice of appeal. Bettertons’ only defense ever presented was a demurrer and general denial.

The order being made without pleadings or evidence, the record gives us no light whatever on the means by which it was made to “ satisfactorily appear to the court that said judgment was rendered under a misapprehension of defendants and their attorneys;” and there is absolutely nothing in the record attempting to invoke the jurisdiction of the court to make such an order. No appeal has been prosecuted from this order; but the plaintiff, treating it as an absolute nullity, and as not affecting, or on its face purporting to affect, its original judgment against defendants, on March 31, 1893, sued out execution to Dallas County, which was returned nulla bona, and alias execution to Brazos County, which was levied by the sheriff of Brazos County on certain lands of W.

The court refused to permit plaintiff to present its demurrer or to offer any evidence, and without argument or evidence from either party, sustained the motion and quashed and vacated the execution. Plaintiff excepted and gave notice of appeal; tendered a bill of exceptions to the court, which the court qualified by reciting the alleged contents and effect of the records of the court." Plaintiff objected to the court’s qualifications of the bill, and insisted that the records were misrecited in the judge’s qualification to the bill, and requested permission to point out the errors claimed to exist in the qualification of the bill. The court refused this request, refused to sign the bill as origi<a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>nally presented, and refused to endorse his refusal thereon as provided by the statute.

      <em>Opinion. </em>— Motion to dismiss this appeal, upon the ground that there was no final order from which an appeal could be taken, was made by appellees, and at a previous day of this term by this court overruled. The court was of the opinion, that after an execution was issued and levied upon property, and a lien thereby secured to the plaintiff in execution, an order quashing the execution was a final disposition of the rights of the plaintiff acquired under the levy, and in contemplation of law a final order from which an appeal could be taken.</p>

Under our statutes, this motion would have lapsed with the term of the court in which it was filed, and no action of the court in relation to such motion, had at a subsequent term, could have the effect to vacate the judgment. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 1372. We think this order, of the court was utterly void, and that the judgment was unaffected by it. This being true, execution was properly issued upon the judgment, and the court was without the power to quash the execution and destroy the lien acquired thereunder, unless its jurisdiction was invoked by a proper proceeding instituted for the purpose of setting aside the judgment, which was not the case here.</p>
