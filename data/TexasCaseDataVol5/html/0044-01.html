The first note here sued on is payable to Marie L. Ennis, and is endorsed “ Marie L. Ennis;” and is further endorsed, “ Pay to the order of Panhandle National Bank for collection, account of First National Bank, Chicago. December 26, 1890. H. R. Symonds, Cashier.” Walsh v.

The notes were payable to plaintiff or order, and were endorsed by her in blank. When produced by her and offered in evidence, they made a prima facie case of ownership, the same as if they had been payable to bearer. The further endorsement on one of them by the Chicago bank to the Texas bank for collection, tended rather to corroborate than to disprove the ownership as alleged. Johnson v.
