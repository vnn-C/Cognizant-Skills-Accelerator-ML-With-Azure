Judgment of Dismissal by Request — Right of Appeal. — Plaintiff sued B., a nonresident, and had attachment levied on land of his in the State. Pending the suit, B. died, and his nonresident heirs were made defendants, and upon motion of one of them the attachment was quashed, on the ground that the death of B. annulled and discharged the attachment hand and lien. Plaintiffs excepted to this order, dismissed the case, and gave notice of appeal. <em>Held, </em>that after the attachment was quashed a dismissal of the case was the proper order to be made by the court, and that plaintiffs did not waive their right of appeal by-requesting such dismissal.</p>

That they have the right to appeal from the judgment, there seems to be but little question (Railway v. Railway, 68 Texas, 98), and we have also reached the conclusion, that in this case they should be heard to complain of the action of the court in quashing their attachment.</p>
    <p id="b95-10" data-blocks='[["BL_95.6",95,[193,938,1304,386]]]'>It seems that in the absence of the attachment lien plaintiffs’ cause.of action against the heirs of Burbridge, upon the death of their ancestor, would have been in personam to recover the value of the property they had received (Mayes v. Jones, 62 Texas, 365; Low, Administrator, v. Felton, 84 Texas, 378); and as all the parties were nonresidents, and the defendants had not appeared, the suit could not have been longer maintained without the issuance of a new attachment based upon such value. York v. The State, 73 Texas, 651.</p>
    <p id="b95-13" data-blocks='[["BL_95.7",95,[192,1338,1305,434]]]'>The only proper judgment then for the court to have rendered upon quashing the attachment, would have been to have dismissed the case of its own motion for want of jurisdiction; and we do not believe plaintiffs should be placed in a worse attitude than they would have occupied had this been done, by reason of their request to the court to take this course. Had they subsequently moved the court to reinstate the suit and attachment, there would be no doubt of their right to assign error to its refusal to do so. Lockett v. Railway, 78 Texas, 211; Easterling v. Blythe, 7 Texas, 210; Cotton v. Lyter, 81 Texas, 10.</p>
    <p id="b95-15" data-blocks='[["BL_95.8",95,[192,1785,1303,385]]]'>As to whether an attachment abates and its lien is lost by the death of the debtor after the levy of the writ and before the rendition of judgment, is a question about which there is much conflict of authority, each case depending to a great extent upon the statutes of the particular State in which rendered. A discussion of this question will be found in 1 Wade on Attachment, section 291; also in 1 American and English Encyclopœdia of Law, 933, and 5 ib., 134; also, see Graham v. Boynton, 35 Texas, 712.</p>

Article 179 of our Revised Statutes provides: “The execution of the writ of attachment upon any property of the defendant subject thereto, unless the writ should be quashed or otherwise vacated, shall create a lien from the date of such levy on the real estate levied on,” etc. Article 1248 provides, that a pending suit shall not abate upon the death of <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>the defendant, and for making his legal representatives parties. Our probate laws recognize the validity of subsisting liens, and make ample provision for their enforcement, subject only to certain preferred claims; and we can see no reason why a specific lien of this kind should be lost by death in this State, while others of no higher dignity are preserved.</p>

    <p id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[295,577,1303,435]]]'>That the levy of an attachment upon real estate operated as a lien thereon in favor of the attaching creditor, had been thoroughly settled by numerous decisions of our Supreme Court, even before the adoption of our Revised Statutes. Tuttle v. Turner, 28 Texas, 759; Hancock v. Henderson, 45 Texas, 479; Wallace v. Bogel, 66 Texas, 572. Should administration be granted upon the estate, we see no difficulty in enforcing this lien through the Probate Court, in the same manner that contract liens would be required to be enforced under the same circumstances. Robertson v. Paul, 16 Texas, 472.</p>
    <p id="b96-6" data-blocks='[["BL_96.6",96,[289,1025,1306,438]]]'>If, however; appellants’ lien was not lost by the death of their debtor after the levy of the attachment, we see no reason why, under the allegations of their amended petition, they should not be allowed to proceed with its foreclosure in the present suit against the heirs, without having an administrator appointed. Their allegations seem clear and specific, that this is the only debt, and the only relief they seek is the subjection of the land to their lien for its payment, and, we think this makes a clear &lt;case, under our decisions, for dispensing with administration. Solomon v. Skinner, 82 Texas, 345; Patterson v. Allen, 50 Texas, 23.</p>
    <p id="b96-7" data-blocks='[["BL_96.7",96,[293,1475,1303,388]]]'>If we are correct in the foregoing conclusions, the other grounds of the motion are manifestly not well taken. What we have said would dispose of the objections to the bond on the ground that it is payable to the original, instead of the present, defendant; and it is no longer an open question, that our rule which prohibits attorneys from becoming sureties on such bonds without leave of the court, is only directory, and does not have the effect of rendering their acts in violation of it either void or voidable.
