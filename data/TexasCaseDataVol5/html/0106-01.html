      <em>Opinion. </em>— If the rent was due to plaintiff, Muenster must have had authority from him to collect it before he could receive it in satisfaction of the claim. The mere fact that he was authorized to make the contract <em>“ </em>would not, as of course, confer upon him the incidental authority to receive payments’’ subsequently falling due; but it would be a circumstance or a fact by which, considered with other facts and circumstances, such special authority might be established or implied. The jury should be left to determine the fact upon proper instructions. The charge asked was the law, and should have been given, with the qualifications indicated above. Smith v.

Muenster, offered by plaintiff in rebuttal of the testimony of defendant as to statements made to him by J. H. Muenster as to the effect of the deed to plaintiff by J. II. and D. C. Muenster, and in rebuttal of the presumption of fraud which might arise from the face of the contract read by defendant, and for the purpose of showing title and good faith, as set out in plaintiff’s first bill of exceptions.’ ’</p>

H. Muenster’s statement to D. C. Muenster, offered in evidence as to the effect of the instrument, was hearsay; and secondly, the instrument was not ambiguous. It spoke for <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>itself. If it does not convey title by its terms, paroi evidence can not add to it to give it such effect. It was a contract by the Muensters to convey the lot and premises to plaintiff, upon certain terms to be complied with by him. The title remained in the Muensters until such compliance, and upon such compliance, which of course could be shown by paroi, the right and real title vested in plaintiff, and not before. It seems that plaintiff did comply, and so became the owner before Hen-dry’s lease, the basis of this suit, commenced to run, and the court submitted the case upon that theory; the defenses being made to depend upon payment to J. H. Muenster as agent.</p>

We can not say, and do not intend to say, anything that will then affect that question. Nor do we intend to conclude the investigation as to whether Hendry in fact rented from plaintiff as the owner — that is, from Muenster as agent of the plaintiff.</p>
