T. Holland, be set aside and held void, because the judge who rendered the same was disqualified by reason of interest in the matters in controversy. The judgment sought to be vacated was one dissolving the corporation of the city of Amarillo, and enjoining appellants, as officers of said city, from collecting the occupation and ad valorem taxes which had been levied upon inhabitants and property therein. It was agreed that the judge who rendered the judgment owned real and personal property upon which said tax was sought to be collected, and that the collection of his tax was enjoined with the rest.</p>

Nalle, 85 Texas, 534, in speaking of the disqualification of one of the judges of the Court of Civil Appeals, our Supreme Court says: “The bonds already issued were alleged to amount to the sum of $900,000. The sum of the bonds the issue of which was sought to be enjoined was $500,000. If the latter obligations should be issued, they would, prima facie at least, authorize the assessment and collection of a tax upon all taxable values in the city for their payment. <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>If their issue should be restrained, no such tax could be levied. It follows, therefore, as we think, that every holder of property in the city which is subject to taxation has not only an interest in the question to be determined by the suit, but also a direct pecuniary interest in the result.”</p>
