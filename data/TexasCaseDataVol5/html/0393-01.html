Moore &amp; Co. for the benefit of certain preferred creditors of the firm of F. M. Moore <em>&amp; </em>Co. The sheriff and sureties answered, alleging, that the goods were seized under writs of attachment in favor of certain parties, naming them, and vouching them in upon their indemnity bonds, and that the goods were the property of F. M. Moore &amp; Co., and subject to the levy, etc. They also attacked the validity of the deed of trust under which plaintiff claimed, upon several grounds. The case was tried by the court without a jury, and resulted in a judgment for plaintiff against the sheriff and his sureties for $2403.17, and in favor of the sheriff against the parties to the indemnity bonds.</p>

Moore, who executed the deed of trust in the name of the firm, was a partner, and the general and sole manager of the business, under a written partnership agreement. His other partners were J. D. Boydstun, who lived at Rockwall, Texas, and was engaged in business there; and Louis Boydstun, who lived at Baird, Texas, and was engaged in business at that point. On the day the deed of trust was executed, the telegraph <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>wires between Kaufman and other points were down, and F. M. Moore was unable to get communication with his other partners. On that morning he learned that his partners had been attached at Rockwall.

It is well settled that a sale by one partner of his interest in the firm business dissolves the partnership and severs the partnership relations. Carter v. Roland, 53 Texas, 540; Carroll v.

The position assumed is, that a partner of an insolvent firm, after dissolution resulting from the sale of one of the partner’s interest, can not make a valid assignment of partnership assets for the benefit of the firm creditors, with preference to some of them. It has been seen that one partner, without the concurrence of the other partners, may, under certain conditions, make a valid common law assignment of firm property to pay partnership1 obligations, and that this right is not <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>lost by a dissolution of the partnership relations. As with the concurrence of all the partners the joint property could have been sold or assigned for the benefit of preferred creditors of the firm, no good reason is perceived why the one partner, acting under the conditions which give authority to bind the firm, may not as effectually make such a conveyance.
