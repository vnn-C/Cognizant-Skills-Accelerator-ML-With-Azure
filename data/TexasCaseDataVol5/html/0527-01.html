Cause of Action — Failure to Deliver Telegram. — Suit for damages for failure to deliver the following message to the plaintiff: “Water is getting low; come out;” signed by agent of the plaintiff at Marfa, and directed to him at San Marcos, Texas. It was alleged that plaintiff had a large stock of cattle on his ranch near Marfa, in charge of the agent who sent the dispatch; that water was giving out, and the presence of plaintiff was necessary at the ranch to make arrangements for obtaining stock water; that from the delay in the delivery plaintiff was delayed three days in reaching the ranch; that the urgency of the dispatch and the facts causing it were made known to the telegraph operator when the dispatch was sent. Damages for want of water alleged. <em>Held, </em>that the petition showed a cause of action.</p>

A. Mitchell. The cattle required a large supply of water, and it was sufficient on the ranch for their sustenance up to the 23rd of March, 1890, when it was suddenly reduced and became insufficient, so that the cattle were on the 24th day of March in danger of perishing for water, unless speedily relieved. Mitchell, the agent, was <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>not, in the absence of plaintiff, who was at his home in San, Marcos, able to procure the needed supply of water for the cattle. In the absence of plaintiff from the ranch, Mitchell, the agent, could not, nor could any one else, make the necessary arrangements to supply the water, because special negotiations on behalf of plaintiff with third parties were necessary to effect such arrangements. Such arrangements were practicable, and could have been sucessfully negotiated with third parties by plaintiff, in time to have prevented the alleged damage to the cattle. The presence of plaintiff at the ranch was necessary to effect such arrangements. Accordingly, on the 24th of March, 1890, at 8:35 a. m., plaintiff’s agent delivered to defendant, at its office in Marfa, the message before set out, which was received by defendant and agreed to be transmitted to San Marcos and immediately delivered to plaintiff with reasonable diligence, he paying the toll, 50 cents; defendant owning and operating a continuous line for telegraphic communication between the two points.</p>
    <p id="b555-4" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[173,1067,1296,537]]]'>The petition here alleges: “ That when said message in writing was so delivered to and accepted by defendant, to-wit, at the said time and place and in the manner aforesaid, defendant was then and there at the same time notified of and informed of the aforesaid dangerous situation of said cattle; that they were upon said ranch; that the supply of water had become insufficient for them; that they were in present danger of starving for water; of the urgent necessity for the personal presence of plaintiff at said ranch, in order that he might provide water for them. And that said message in writing was intended to summon him to come at once from said town of San Marcos to said ranch, with all possible speed, in order that he might make arrangements necessary to obtain the needed water.”</p>

That if it had been delivered to him within a reasonable time he could and would have gone thereupon forthwith to his ranch, and could and would have provided water for his cattle in time to have prevented the injuries to them complained of; that plaintiff was ignorant of the dangerous condition of the cattle, and remained absent from the ranch three days longer than he would have done if the message had been delivered with reasonable diligence; that if it had been so delivered, he would have arrived at his ranch three days earlier than he actually did, and could and would have provided water for his cattle, and thus have prevented the injury complained of, his actual arrival there being too late to prevent such injuries to the cattle. That during the three days prior to his arrival at the ranch, the cattle were without sufficient water, and suffered for want of water, whereby 1100 of the cows of plaintiff lost their calves and were damaged to the amount of $5500; from the same cause 550 of his cattle died, of <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>the value of $6000, and the remainder were injured in value to the amount of $15,500; all aggregating $27,000.50. “ Wherefore,” it is alleged, “ that by reason of the premises herein before set out in this petition, and in and through and by the gross negligence of defendant aforesaid in regard to said message in writing, and the said injuries to the said property caused thereby, he (plaintiff) was and is actually damaged in the aggregate sum of $27,000.50, for which he brings this suit.” Prayer for such amount.</p>
