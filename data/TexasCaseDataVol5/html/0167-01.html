      <em>Opinion. </em>— Plaintiff in error says: “ The court erred in its second finding of facts, to the effect that the nonpayment of accrued interest on the 1st day of March, 1891, matured the principal debt, which at that day had one year to run, the documents in evidence and introduced by plaintiff not legally being subject to that construction.”</p>

    <p id="b197-5" data-blocks='[["BL_197.4",197,[168,428,1299,890]]]'>We see'no reason why this clause in the deed of trust should not be enforced. It is true that the amended petition did not set up the failure to pay-the interest coupon due March 1, 1891, as a ground for maturing the whole debt; it claimed this for the failure to pay the interest coupon due September 1, 1890; but it did set out the nonpayment of the interest due March 1,1891; and when defendant answered, that plaintiff had for a consideration agreed to forbear suit on the interest due September 1, 1890, plaintiff then set up the nonpayment of the interest due March 1, 1891, as maturing the entire debt. This interest accrued and matured the whole debt nearly one month before the original suit was filed. The agreement to forbear suit on interest due September 1, 1890, was expressly limited to that interest, and would not affect the maturing of the debt and the right to sue on nonpayment of interest due March 1, 1891. Inasmuch as the agreement was so limited, a reasonable time of forbearance would not extend over after the time of maturity of the next coupon. This conclusion of the court is not inconsistent with the other finding, that defendant’s allegations of agreement of forbearance on the interest due September 1, 1890, were true.</p>
    <p id="b197-8" data-blocks='[["BL_197.5",197,[168,1331,1298,286]]]'>Plaintiff in error assigns as error the finding of fact by the court, that “ the evidence does not sustain defendant’s plea of usury,” because the evidence, it is asserted, fully showed that defendant was charged, under the guise of interest, a bonus of $300, in addition to interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum; and besides, the papers show on their face that the interest was compounded semi-annually.</p>

But said agreement did not embrace any definite time of forbearance. Said assignment and agreement was made February 3, 1891.’ The error consists in not giving effect to the implied agreement that grew out of and flowed from said assignment [of rents]; the rent assigned being $360 per annum, and the yearly interest accruing on the debt being $300. The rents did not go by the trust to the lien holder, his lien being on the cor<a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>pus of the property. Subsequent to the creation of the lien on the corpus of the property, the borrower assigned the rents to pay accruing interest, which was abundant so to do. The court failed to give effect to the contract, that as long as the rents were sufficient to pay accruing interest no suit would be brought for the interest, and no advantage taken of the forfeiture clause in the deed of trust. The assignment of the rent being continuing, and being sufficient to pay the rent, the suit was prematurely brought. Whether the foregoing be exactly true or not, there flows from the assignment an implied contract that the lien holder would forbear for a reasonable length of time, under the facts and circumstances; and the court erred in not finding that from the 3rd of February to [4th of April] the date the suit was filed was not reasonable time.”</p>
    <p id="b198-5" data-blocks='[["BL_198.4",198,[299,924,1306,883]]]'>The allegations in the third section of defendant’s answer only set up the transfer of rents as a satisfaction of the interest due on the 1st day of September, 1890, and a forbearance to sue because of nonpayment of the same. The court’s finding was, that this part of the answer “ as to the assignment of rents on certain property, and the implied agreement by plaintiff, in consideration of such agreement, to forbear, are true.” The meaning of the finding, then, is, that the assignment was made as stated, and that in consideration thereof plaintiff agreed to forbear bringing suit because of the failure to pay the interest falling due on the 1st day of September, 1890. The court also found all the allegations of plaintiff’s amended petition, filed May 8, 1891, up to and including the fifteenth section or paragraph, to be true. The fifth and sixth sections of the amended petition allege that $50 of the interest coupon for $150 due September 1, 1890, was paid on November 18, 1890, and that the balance was due, and defendant had failed and refused to pay the same. It was also alleged in the sixth section of the petition, that no part of interest coupon due March 1, 1891, had been paid. These allegations are true, according to the findings of the court.</p>
    <p id="b198-6" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[295,1820,1305,579]]]'>No definite time of forbearance was agreed to, and a reasonable time only would be implied. It was not agreed that defendant would be indulged in ease of failure to pay the interest on the next maturing interest coupon, nor could such agreement be implied. It could not be implied that so long as the rents were sufficient to pay the accruing interest, no suit would be brought. Plaintiff was authorized to collect the rents men-' tioned; but it is evident that only $50 had been paid on the coupon due September 1, 1890, and nothing on the rest of the debt, or interest, except $30 (of the $60 due plaintiff for amount paid for insurance on mortgaged property covered and secured by the trust deed), which $30 seems to have been collected out of the rents; though whether out of the rents or not is not deemed material.</p>

In this sense we understand the findings of the court below, and they are entirely consistent and correct, according to our views of the rights of the parties as before shown.</p>
    <p id="b199-7" data-blocks='[["BL_199.7",199,[163,980,1300,1183]]]'>The finding, that “ the agreement to forbear, though for no specific time, must be construed to mean for a reasonable time, <em>provided, </em>defendant paid the other notes when they fell due,” is the correct solution of the question; and so the finding that “ the defendant having failed to pay the note for interest due March 1, 1891, the entire debt again fell .due, and suit was not prematurely brought,” is a necessary conclusion. The suit was brought after the debt matured by default of payment of the coupon due March 1,1891. The lower court adds to this finding: “ The fact that the original petition did not allege that the principal became due because of the failure to pay the interest due March 1,1891, but did allege that it was due because of the failure to pay the interest due September 1, 1890, ought not to subject the plaintiff to the payment of the cost of the suit, when, by pleading filed before the trial, it was alleged that the whole debt matured because of the nonpayment of the interest due March 1, 1891.” This is true. What the original petition did contain we can not tell, except from the above finding; but the amended petition sets out the coupons due September 1 and March 1, but only claims that the failure to pay the one due September 1 matured the entire debt, which was also the case with the original petition, according to the finding above; but when defendant set up facts to show that plaintiff had contracted not to sue for the default on the September interest, plaintiff then replied that the default of payment on the succeeding March interest authorized the suit. It was a sufficient reply to the answer, and showed that the suit was not prematurely brought. It was sustained by the facts.</p>
