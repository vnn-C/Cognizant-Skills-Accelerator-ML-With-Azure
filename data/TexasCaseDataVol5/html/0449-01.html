Then followed the allegation, that on January 25, 1887,, the defendants, in accordance with their previous agreement as alleged, jointly-purchased the said second mortgage for the-sum of $20,000 in Mexican eagle coin, worth in lawful money of the United States $15,872; and that inasmuch as the said Celaya was the trustee for all parties interested in said railway, and the said Armendiaz had full knowledge of the facts. <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>set out, said purchase enured to the benefit of plaintiff and its stockholders upon repayment to them by plaintiff of the amount so paid, wicli interest, which plaintiff offered to do; and prayed judgment that defendants be compelled to receive the same in satisfaction of said mortgage, etc.</p>

    <p id="b478-9" data-blocks='[["BL_478.8",478,[284,973,1296,237]]]'>1. On January 25, 1887, and for sometime prior thereto, as well as subsequently, the appellee, Simon Celaya, and F. San Roman had the management of the appellant’s railroad and other property as trustees under the first mortgage of said railroad. Celaya was the active managing trustee of the railroad.</p>
    <p id="b478-10" data-blocks='[["BL_478.9",478,[280,1221,1299,635]]]'>2. On the date mentioned Armendiaz bought from the owners thereof the second or Railton mortgage, amounting to $50,000, for $15,872, and the transfer was made in his name. A few months afterwards he transferred a one-half interest therein to the defendant Celaya. Armendiaz was a large holder of the first mortgage bonds of the plaintiff company, and had many dealings and interviews with Celaya as managing trustee of the railroad, and full knowledge of his active trusteeship. He made an offer to Celaya to join him in the purchase of the mortgage before it was made, and they consulted appellant’s attorney as to the validity of the mortgage, and what he thought about buying it; and being advised that it was valid, and that it would be an excellent idea to buy it, for in the hands of strangers it might become a dangerous weapon, Armendiaz purchased it.</p>
    <p id="b478-11" data-blocks='[["BL_478.10",478,[281,1868,1297,240]]]'>3. There is a conflict in the testimony as to whether or not Celaya was interested in the purchase of the mortgage when it was bought and transferred to Armendiaz; but the evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion that Celaya was not an original purchaser with Armendiaz, but bought one-lialf interest therein some months afterwards.</p>

      <em>Conclusions of </em>Law.— 1. It is not disputed that Celaya, as trustee of the bondholders, in charge of and managing appellant’s railroad, occu<a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>pied toward it such fiduciary relation as prevented him from buying up its obligations at a discount and making a profit thereon; nor is it contended that as a stockholder in the appellant corporation and an owner of a part of the bonds secured by the first mortgage on its railroad and other property, the appellee, Armendiaz, was prevented from buying the bonds by reason of any fiduciary relations to the appellant as such stockholder and owner of its bonds. The contention is, that the purchase of Armendiaz should enure to the benefit of the appellant, because of his participation with the trustee, Celaya, with knowledge of his fiduciary relations. Armendiaz was not a purchaser from Celaya with knowledge of a trust, nor do the facts disclose any such action on his part in the purchase of the mortgage as would render him liable to account to the company for the profits. Even if it should be conceded that the purchase was made for the joint benefit of both of the defendants, there was nothing shown by the evidence that would make the purchase, as to the interest of Armendiaz, enure to the benefit of the plaintiff.</p>

    <p id="b479-3" data-blocks='[["BL_479.6",479,[187,1123,1303,488]]]'>
      <em>2. </em>The written transfer from Armendiaz to Celaya, put in evidence by the defendant without objection, contained the following recital: “And whereas, $10,000 in Mexican eagle coin, or that is to say, one equal half of the purchase price paid by me, the said Francisco Armendaiz, as aforesaid, for said second mortgage of the said Rio Grande Railway Company and the debt secured thereby, was the property of and furnished for that purpose by Simon Celaya, of the city of Brownsville, in the county of Cameron and State of Texas; and whereas, one-half of said second mortgage of the said Rio Grande Railway Company and the debt secured thereby is, by force of the facts above stated, the property of said Celaya.”</p>
    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.7",479,[186,1622,1301,585]]]'>Defendants then offered oral testimony to prove that the recital did not state the facts, and that the true facts were, that not until several months after the defendant Armendiaz acquired the mortgage in question did he make the arrangement with Celaya to transfer the one-half interest to him. The evidence was admitted, over the objection of the plaintiff that the defendants were estopped from denying any of said recitals, and because no foundation or predicate had been laid in any of the pleadings. Neither objection is well taken. Hicks v. Morris, 57 Texas, 661; Pool v. Chase, 46 Texas, 210, and other authorities cited by appellee. But the error, if any, becomes immaterial, when it is considered that plaintiff would not be entitled to recover against Armendiaz, although he and Celaya bought the mortgage jointly.</p>
