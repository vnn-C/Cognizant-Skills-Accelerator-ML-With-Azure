      <em>Conclusions of Law. </em>— Appellants are clearly estopped by the record from setting up claim to this land. In the appropriate language of the learned judge who tried the case below, “ The law of this State will not permit a married woman to invoke the aid of the courts to recover the purchase money of her separate property, and then, after the lapse of twenty years, invoke the aid of the same power to restore to her the property, when she makes no effort to show that she has been defrauded or injured by the transaction, and when no tender to repay the money so received has been made.”</p>
    <p id="b737-11" data-blocks='[["BL_737.10",737,[174,1761,1309,739]],["BL_738.1",738,[293,325,1298,128]]]'>The deed attempted to be made by Cora IÍ. Morris and her husband, E. L. Morris, to Robert Purnell, for the land in controversy, expressed upon its face that a vendor’s lien was reserved upon the land to secure the balance of the purchase money, $800. That deed, though defective (it not being shown in the officer’s certificate of acknowledgment that the contents of the deed were fully explained to her by the officer taking the same), yet it was the subject of ratification by the husband and wife. Instead of claiming the purchase money, Mrs. Morris could have brought suit against Purnell directly for the land. It is clear that she was not •entitled to both. If so, she could have brought suit for both money and land at the same time. But she and her husband elected to claim the money, which they did, in a suit against the purchaser to foreclose the vendor’s lien. It is claimed that the deed did not convey the title, and that the superior title remained in Mrs. Morris. The superior title remains in the vendor in every case of the sale of real estate in which a <a id="p712" href="#p712" data-label="712" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*712</a>vendor’s lien is reserved to secure the purchase money, and if the acknowledgment had been perfect, the superior title would still have been in her.</p>
    <p id="b738-5" data-blocks='[["BL_738.4",738,[291,474,1301,583]]]'>Mr. Freeman says: “Where proper parties are brought before the court, a judgment either foreclosing or refusing to foreclose a mortgage <em>or other lien </em>is conclusive of all the issues necessarily determined by it. The ordering of sale is conclusive of the existence of the debt and of the lien.” 1 Freem. on Judg., sec. 303. Again, “ The entry of a judgment or decree establishes in the most conclusive manner, and reduces to the most authentic form, that which had hitherto been unsettled, and which had, in all probability, depended for its settlement upon destructible and uncertain evidence. The cause of action thus established and permanently attested is said to merge into the judgment establishing it. * * * It is ‘drowned in the judgment,’ and must henceforth be regarded as functus officio.” <a href="/citations/?q=9%20S.E.%2061" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 S.E. 61">Id.,</a> sec. 215.</p>

They are presumed to have the capacity ‘ * to conduct the litigation as shall be most conducive to their own advantage.” Urquhart v. Womack, 53 Texas, 618, and authorities there cited.</p>
    <p id="b738-9" data-blocks='[["BL_738.6",738,[289,1322,1302,287]]]'>In order to be just, the same rules must be applied to them as to other litigants, and they are estopped by judgments rendered by courts of competent jurisdiction in cases to which they are parties, upon the same principle that other litigants are estopped. Henderson v. Terry, 62 Texas, 281; Baxter v. Dear, 24 Texas, 17; Lee v. Kingsbury, 13 Texas, 67; Webb v. Mallard, 27 Texas, 86; Ryan v. Maxey, 43 Texas, 192.</p>
    <p id="b738-10" data-blocks='[["BL_738.7",738,[288,1621,1301,234]]]'>It has been frequently held in this State, that the ‘ ‘ equities of persons claiming under instruments executed by married women, but not properly acknowledged and certified, have been recognized and protected.” Johnson v. Taylor, 60 Texas, 365; Dalton v. Rust, 22 Texas, 133; Womack v. Womack, 8 Texas, 397.</p>
    <p id="b738-11" data-blocks='[["BL_738.8",738,[287,1869,1299,87]]]'>In applying the above principles to this case, as presented in the able and exhaustive brief of appellants, we conclude:</p>
    <p id="b738-12" data-blocks='[["BL_738.9",738,[286,1969,1304,236]]]'>1. That the admission of the deed of appellants to Robert Purnell was immaterial, and could have had no effect, whether admitted or rejected, as appellants were fully estopped by the judgment of foreclosure and the litigation growing out of the same, and no other judgment could have-been properly rendered.</p>
    <p id="b738-13" data-blocks='[["BL_738.10",738,[287,2217,1302,288]],["BL_739.2",739,[156,315,1300,443]]]'>2. By the suit of appellants to foreclose the vendor’s lien upon the land in controversy, they said to the court, in effect, “We <em>have sold </em>this land to Robert Purnell; we have made him a title, reserving a vend- or’s lien thereon to secure the purchase money, and we invoke your power to foreclose this lien.” The court by its judgment found this to be true, and by reason of its truth reached out its strong arm and forced: <a id="p713" href="#p713" data-label="713" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*713</a>the defendant to pay. This judgment is conclusive of the facts there found. Now, after this judgment of foreclosure, and a satisfaction of the judgment by the defendant, the plaintiffs, still holding the money thus recovered, again invoke the same power, and this time they virtually say, “ We <em>did not sell </em>the land to Purnell; it is ours; give it back to us.” Can any rule of law, of equity, or of justice grant such a demand ? To do so would be a mockery of the decrees of the court, a travesty upon justice, a burlesque upon equity, and “ equivalent to a fraud” perpetrated under the guise of law.</p>
