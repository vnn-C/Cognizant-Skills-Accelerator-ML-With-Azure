Should the sums so found due from said Faires to said W. C. Jones exceed the sum of said $1000 and interest, then the excess shall be paid over to said W. C. Jones. Should the sums so found due from said Faires to said Jones not be sufficient to pay said sum of $1000 and interest, the said W. C. Jones obligates and binds himself to pay to T. M. Blakemore and J. H. Routh the amount which may be so found still due to make said sum of $1000 and interest. That when said settlement is made as aforesaid, or said Jones shall demand, said T. M. Blakemore and J. H.

That in the spring of 1887 he called on Mr. Jones, at the instance of plaintiffs, to know whether he and Mr. Faires had settled upon the amounts of the rents for 1886 and 1887, and he told me that they had not.” That about a week before this suit was filed he made a formal demand on Jones to comply with his contract, when Jones replied, “ I can do nothing; <em>* * * </em>I will see my lawyer.” That in July, 1887, Mr. Faires called in his office, and said that he “had received a letter from Dr. Blakemore, urging him and Jones to settle, and saying that he was in need of some money.”</p>

That is, that Jones must have a settlement with Faires, and ascertain the amount due him, and have the same endorsed upon the contract before he is released; and that thereafter appellants must look to Faires for payment of that amount.</p>
    <p id="b548-8" data-blocks='[["BL_548.7",548,[302,1516,1296,187]]]'>Appellee, Jones, himself was upon the witness stand, and did not in the slightest degree on this point contradict the statements made by appellants and the witness Hill, who drew up the contract, and held it awaiting the settlement and for the endorsement to be made thereon.</p>
    <p id="b548-9" data-blocks='[["BL_548.8",548,[291,1714,1308,488]]]'>And as further proof that appellee, Jones, so construed the contract sued on, prior to the filing of this suit he did not deliver or offer to deliver up to appellants his lease contract made in writing with Faires, but retained it in his possession, and attached it to his pleadings in this case; .and prior to this suit attempted to arbitrate the matter of difference between himself and his tenant, Faires, and instead of an effort to ascertain the amount due for rent for the year 1887, he coupled with his claim for rent a demand for damages to fruit trees, pasturage, and other matters, amounting in all to $1955. This effort to arbitrate went on in court for sometime, and was finally abandoned.</p>

As to the claim for the credit of $199.90, we believe this was not named in the briefs filed by either party, and was not before called to our attention.

    <p id="b549-7" data-blocks='[["BL_549.8",549,[169,1024,1300,386]]]'>It is true, however, that in July, 1887, Faires left with Hill a claim for collection for $199.90, and told him to collect and send to Dr. Blake-more; saying that he had received a letter from Dr. Blakemore urging him and Jones to settle, and saying that he was in need of money. This amount Hill collected and sent to Blakemore, which Blakemore says he received the latter part of August, 1887. The contract sued on should foe credited with this amount as of August 31, 1887; and our former judgment is so reformed.</p>
