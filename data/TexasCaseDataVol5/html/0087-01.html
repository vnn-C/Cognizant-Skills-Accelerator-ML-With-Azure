No decisive test can be given, but in all cases the act must have been done while in the prosecution of some business for the master, and that business must have been such as the servant had authority from the master to do. That is, he must have been authorized, either expressly or impliedly, to do the adt in some manner which he has improperly or wrongfully performed; and the fact that he was only authorized to do the act in a certain way does not save the master from liability. If he was authorized to do the act at all, the master is liable for the consequences of his doing it in a different manner, if the mode adopted by him is so far incident to the employment that it comes within its scope; for having given the servant <em>any </em>authority in the premises, he alone must suffer for its abuse. He has set the wrong <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>in motion, and must abide the consequences as against innocent parties. In all cases the question as to whether the act was authorized is one for the jury, in view of all the circumstances, and unless there is an <em>entire absence of </em>authority, the master will be held chargeable.

If so, appellant must be held liable for the terms in which the order is given.

The conductor in charge of this train, as a witness for appellant, testified: “The Texas <em>&amp; </em>Pacific Railway Company had given no orders nor authority to its brakemen to eject trespassers from its cars or trains. It is common for brakemen finding trespassers on the train to tell them to get off, but they have no orders to put them off, nor is it any part of their duty to put them off if they refuse to go. The brakeman’s duty, if a trespasser refuses to go, would be to report the matter to the conductor, so that he might take the proper action in regard to ejecting him.”</p>

I considered that I was discharging my duty to the railway company in ordering the boys off the train.”</p>

In Hutchinson on Carriers, section 553, the distinction is shown in the following language: “ The carrier is not under the same degree of obligation as to care and diligence to guard against injuries to strangers as he is in case of those against passengers. His duty to the former is governed by the general principle of law, that every one is obliged, upon considerations of humanity and justice, to conform his conduct to the rights of others, and in the prosecution of his lawful business to use every reasonable precaution to avoid their injury.”</p>

Railway v. Robinson, 4 Texas Civ. App., 121. Upon these grounds it has very generally been held, that the company is liable if it uses unnecessary violence in expelling a trespasser from its cars, or compels him to leave while the train is in motion, by reason of which he is injured.

Appellant’s fifth, sixth, and seventh assignments are therefore held to be not sustainable.</p>

H. Barnes, acting within the scope of his authority, by an exhibition of force and by threatening language such as would reasonably alarm one of the age and maturity of said Joseph C. Mother, compelled said Mother, through the influence of fear, to attempt to leave <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>said cars at a time and under circumstances rendering it dangerous to do so, and if in his attempt to leave said cars, the said Mother exercised reasonable care for his own safety under all the circumstances surrounding him, and was killed in said attempt, then, if you further find that plaintiffs are the parents of said Joseph C. Mother, and have suffered any damage on account of his death, you will find for them the amount of damages so suffered.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[182,681,1301,737]]]'>“ But upon the other hand, if you find that said Barnes was not acting within the scope of his authority in ordering said Mother to leave said cars, and if he had not been authorized by the defendant company or the conductor of said train of cars so to do, then the defendant could not be held liable for any injury to said Mother occasioned by the acts of said Barnes. Or if you find that in attempting to leave the said cars the said Mother failed to exercise due and reasonable care for his own safety, and if his failure to exercise such care contributed to his injury, then you will find for defendant. Or if, notwithstanding the words and acts of said Barnes, a person of ordinary prudence, similarly situated and circumstanced as said Mother was, and of his age and discretion, would not have attempted to leave said car at the time and under the circumstances that he did, then you will find for the defendant, notwithstanding that you may believe that the defendant or its employes were guilty of negligence.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[182,1429,1300,235]]]'>Appellant complains of this charge, upon the ground that the jury was thereby authorized to find against it, without reference to the degree of danger, or whether the train was at rest or in motion, and that the question of negligence was therein treated as one of law, instead of fact for the decision of the jury.</p>
    <p id="b119-6" data-blocks='[["BL_119.6",119,[183,1677,1300,337]]]'>The word “ dangerous,” at which the complaint seems to be directed, is defined by Mr. Webster as follows: “Attended or beset with danger; full of risk; perilous; hazardous; unsafe.” The charge very clearly left the jury to decide as to whether Mother was compelled to leave the car under such circumstances as to make it “ dangerous” as thus defined, and if their finding be sustained by the evidence, we are of opinion the company would be liable, whether the car was standing still or in motion.</p>
    <p id="b119-8" data-blocks='[["BL_119.7",119,[183,2026,1299,435]]]'>We believe, however, the jury must have found from the evidence that he was ordered to leave while the car was in motion. A number of disinterested witnesses testify to this, and the brakeman only contends the order was given a few seconds before the car started. There is no conflict in the evidence as to the brakeman’s knowledge of the manner in which deceased was required to leave the car (through the 1 ‘ cuddy hole ”), and under such circumstances we are not prepared to hold that it was necessary for its servant’s act to have been <em>grossly </em>improper to render appellant liable.

The charge, as a whole, very clearly and fully placed the burden on plaintiffs to prove the necessary facts before they would be authorized to recover; and the charge complained of was only an affirmative instruction, if they found the facts as therein stated, to return a verdict in favor of the defendant, which was strictly proper; but they were also instructed to find in favor of defendant if they failed to find the necessary facts authorizing a recovery by plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[290,713,1299,485]]]'>We do not think the court erred in refusing to charge the jury at request of appellant, that ‘ ‘ if the deceased was ordered by the brakeman to leave the train, but at a time when the train was standing still, this would not render the defendant liable, if the death of deceased was caused by his attempting to leave the train in obedience to this command after the brakeman had left and the train had been put in motion.” We think this charge would have been objectionable as being upon the weight of the evidence, and also that the issue was sufficiently presented in the latter part of the second paragraph of the charge given the jury, copied at length above.</p>
    <p id="b120-6" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[287,1210,1298,336]]]'>Appellant’s eleventh assignment is as follows: “ The court erred in the seventh paragraph of its instructions to the jury in the portion relating to the issue of deceased’s contributory negligence, in making the same depend on the discretion of deceased, he being shown to be an intelligent person 17 years of age, and not requiring him to exercise such discretion as a person of ordinary discretion, or even one of ordinary discretion for his years, would have exercised under the circumstances.”</p>
