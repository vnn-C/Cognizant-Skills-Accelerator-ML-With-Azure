It is also alleged, that lots and blocks were thereafter sold with reference to said streets and public square, and that many individuals became the purchasers thereof, and that said dedication was accepted by the public; that said public square is situated in the most densely populated portion of said city.

The county contended that the use of the property for a jail was in keeping with the purpose of the dedication, and that such jail was a public use and public necessity.

The statement of such a proposition is an argument that defeats it. Clearly the county or the city would have no such right. It would be an inexcusable appropriation and diversion of the square to purposes and uses foreign to its dedication. It is said, and we think justly so, that public squares, so far as the uses of the property are concerned, except where a right is reserved in dedicating it, are placed in the same category as public highways (Cincinnati v. White, 6 Peters, 431; Commonwealth v. Bowman, 3 Pennsylvania State, 204; 2 Dillon on Municipal Corporations, section 646); and that the public have the right to the use and enjoyment of such highways to the extent of their entire length and width. It is a right in the concrete. And it makes no difference that the obstruction may not practically interfere with the use by the public; if it in fact is an obstruction and encroachment that is not in keeping with the use for which the property was dedicated, it is a purpresture and a nuisance, and as such is abatable.

These acts, although permanent in character, would not be a diversion or a use inconsistent with the dedication, but would be acts in furtherance and in keeping with the original purpose in creating the highway or public square. They would tend, in the first instance, to increase the facilities for the use of the highway; and in the second instance, may make the use and enjoyment of the public square more beneficial in the way it was originally intended it should be used.
