It provides for the execution of a contract in writing, which shall be signed by the husband and wife, and acknowledged by her as is required in making a sale of the homestead. This article also requires that such contract shall be recorded in the county clerk’s office of the county where the property is situated.</p>

    <p id="b564-4" data-blocks='[["BL_564.5",564,[301,882,1295,130]]]'>Article 548, Sayles’ Statutes, requires a conveyance of real estate to be in writing and subscribed and delivered by the party disposing of the same.</p>
    <p id="b564-5" data-blocks='[["BL_564.6",564,[297,1031,1298,487]]]'>In view of these articles of the statute quoted, we do not think it is essential to a conveyance of the homestead or the creation of the lien upon it authorized by article 3174, that the husband should acknowledge the instrument, as is required by the wife. But the conveyance should be in writing, and he should join in it and properly sign it, and be a party to its delivery. In other words, these provisions of the law that regulate the conveyance of the homestead are the same as those that regulate the conveyance of other real property, except that the separate acknowledgment of the wife is required in the first instance in order to create the conveyance..</p>

The general statutes with reference to conveyances, except in the separate acknowledgment by the wife in a sale of the homestead and her separate estate, do not require, in order for the instrument to operate as a conveyance, that it shall be acknowledged by the makers; but it is required by our general registration statutes that all such instruments and conveyances, whether of the separate estate of the wife or of the husband, or other real property, or lien- or encumbrance upon it, shall, as a prerequisite to its registration, be acknowledged by the makers or proven up <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>for registration before some officer authorized to take such acknowledgments or hear such proof. This must be done in order to entitle the instrument to be recorded. And it has been repeatedly held in this State, that the registration of such instruments and conveyances without their proper acknowledgment is insufficient to charge a subsequent purchaser with notice. In other words, such registration of the conveyance without acknowledgment is improper, and it will not impart notice. Nor will the registration of the conveyance of the homestead only acknowledged by the wife, though signed by the husband, dispense with the acknowledgment of the instrument by the husband, and make such record in this condition notice that the conveyance is perfect. The wife and husband must join in the conveyance in order to make it effective, and we think that both should acknowledge it in order to entitle it to registration when •the record is relied on to show that the conveyance exists.</p>

A subsequent purchaser, looking to the record of the former conveyance of the homestead, would find, as in this case, the record of an instrument in which, in legal contemplation, the husband has not joined, because the proof of this fact, as required by law in order to make the record show a good and complete conveyance when tested by the record, has not been shown.</p>
