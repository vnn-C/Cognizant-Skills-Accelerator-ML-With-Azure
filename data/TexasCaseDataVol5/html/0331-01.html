The case was tried February 14, 1891, by the court without a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant for the land. The defendant introduced no evidence of title, and the judgment entered for him was the result of the failure of the plaintiff, in the opinion of the trial court, to prove such title as would justify a recovery of the land.

The defendant objected to the introduction of this deed, and the court sustained the objection and refused to permit it to be read in evidence, upon the ground, as stated by the judge, that it was not shown that there was any application made for an order to sell the land, nor any order of the Probate Court confirming the sale made by the administrator.</p>

      <em>Opinion. </em>— The action of the court in excluding the administrator’s deed, forming a link in plaintiff’s chain of title, is complained of, and made the basis of the several assignments of error presented in the brief of appellant, and constitutes the vital question in the case.</p>
    <p id="b360-8" data-blocks='[["BL_360.7",360,[285,1511,1301,983]],["BL_361.1",361,[169,321,1301,437]]]'>The copies of the probate record from Bed Biver County introduced in evidence by the plaintiff, unquestionably show that the administration of the estate of James H. Johnson, deceased, was conducted with great informality and looseness; and a number of gross errors and irregularities on the part of both the administrator and the court are clearly apparent. But notwithstanding such errors and irregularities in the administration proceedings, which might have been corrected at the instance of parties at interest in a direct proceeding timely instituted for that purpose, if it can be determined that the court had jurisdiction of the estate, that the disposition made by the administrator of the land was such as the court had power to order, and that the court gave its judicial sanction to the sale, though in an irregular manner, such sale must be held valid against collateral attacks. It clearly appears that the estate of James H. Johnson, deceased, was administered upon in the Probate Court of Bed Biver County; that W. S. Todd was the acting and recognized administrator; and as there is no evidence to the contrary, we must assume that the jurisdiction of the court was properly exercised, and that the administrator was duly appointed and authorized to act in the capacity in which he was recognized by the court. It is also apparent that the court had the power to order the sale of the lands in question. It is true that no application <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>for an order to sell the lands of the estate appeared among the probate records introduced in evidence on the trial; each of the orders of sale introduced in evidence recited the fact that application for such order had been made. Independent of such recitals, however, the presumption must be indulged that the court acted regularly, and therefore that application for the order to sell was made and presented to the court. Davis v. Touchstone, 45 Texas, 490; Withers v. Patterson, 27 Texas, 491; Hurley v. Barnard, 48 Texas, 87. This disposes of one of the grounds of objection to the administrator’s deed upon which it was excluded.</p>
    <p id="b361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[169,766,1298,640]]]'>The other, arid more serious objection, to the deed is that there was no confirmation of sale by the Probate Court. This objection is doubtless based upon the idea that in the orders of sale arid order of confirmation there is not sufficient description of the lands to which they relate to identify them with the lands described in the deed of the administrator to Jeptha D. Crawford. It will be seen from the order of sale made in October, 1848, that the administrator came in and filed his <em>inventory </em>and appraisement of the property of the estate, and at that time made application to sell the <em>lands belonging to the estate situate in Cass County; </em>and the order was made to sell the lands “ mentioned” on credit of twelve months, except that a sufficient amount should be sold for cash to pay funeral expenses of deceased, taxes, and expenses of administration already accrued.</p>
    <p id="b361-6" data-blocks='[["BL_361.5",361,[171,1419,1294,286]]]'>In November, 1849, William M. Lambert, a creditor of the estate, presented his petition for a sale of the property of the estate to pay debts; and we learn from the order of the court thereon that the creditor’s claim had been toó long delayed, and that the administrator had no funds with which to pay it, and that it was <em>doubtful if there were enough lands to realize upon sale sufficient money to pay the debts of the estate.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b361-7" data-blocks='[["BL_361.6",361,[169,1716,1295,735]],["BL_362.1",362,[303,320,1301,883]]]'>Upon this state of facts, an order that the administrator proceed to sell enough of the lands, if to be found, sufficient to satisfy the debts was made; and in the event the lands were not sufficient for the purpose, he was ordered to sell enough slaves to supply the deficiency. No return or report of sale by the administrator appears among the proceedings; but on the 24th day of November, 1851, an order was made, purporting to be the action of the court upon a report of such sales, filed in answer to a citation commanding him to report the sales. This order recites, that the administrator presented his report of a resale of lands in the counties of Cass and Titus belonging to the estate, <em>oi-dered </em>at a previous term of the court, and the court proceeded to approve <em>all </em>the sales, except as to six labors and a fraction of the C. Smith headlight, which was qualifiedly approved, and which is not involved in this suit. This order directs the administrator to proceed to convey the lands to the purchasers, naming them, and among the purchasers named is Jeptha D. Crawford. The in<a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>ventory filed by the administrator is not among the probate records, but it will be presumed to have been before the court at the time the sale was ordered, and that the lands ordered to be sold were fully identified to the court by the application and inventory. It is reasonably clear that all the lands of the estate were ordered to be sold to pay the debts of the estate; and it is equally clear that Jeptha D. Crawford became a purchaser at such sale of some of the lands, and that the court approved the sale and ordered the administrator to convejr the lands to him. The deed to Jeptha D. Crawford is dated in May, 1850, while the order approving the sale to him is dated November, 1851. There is nothing in this circumstance to indicate that the sale evidenced by the deed was not the sale intended to be approved. The date upon which the sale was ordered to be made was the first Tuesday in January, 1850, and it has not been at all uncommon for administrators to execute deeds to purchasers after sale and prior to order approving same, subject, of course, to the action of the court upon the report of sale. The order of confirmation, if effective at all, would be equally so, though the deed of the administrator was made before the entry of the order, under the circumstances stated.</p>

Crawford, may not it be presumed in favor of the correctness of the official action of the administrator, that he reported to the court the sale of the land to Crawford which he had previously evidenced by his written deed ?</p>

Wills v. Polk, 36 Texas, 121; Davis v. Touchstone, 45 Texas, 497. It has also been held, that where the application for the order to sell, the order of sale, and the order of confirmation are all vague and indefinite in description of the land, that the sale is not thereby rendered void, but the description may receive aid from other sources.
