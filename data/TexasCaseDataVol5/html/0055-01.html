Defendant’s liability for damages to the plaintiff is based upon a breach of the contract made at the time that the message in question was delivered to and accepted by it at Gainesville, on March 4, 1889, and defendant did not contract to deliver the message sued upon to Mrs. N. E. Foster; and hence the charge of the court with reference to the duty upon the part of the defendant to deliver said message to Mrs. Foster was error, which we submit is fundamental, and imposed upon the defendant a liability and a duty not contracted to be performed, and which it was under no obligation to perform.

Evans, or either of them, prior to the sending of said message, had an agreement and understanding with defendant’s agent and operator at Mount Vernon that said agent should deliver said telegram, when it arrived at Mount Vernon, to Mrs. N. E. Foster; and if you further believe that at the time of said agreement and understanding with said Mount Vernon agent the said agent was informed of the object, purpose, and importance of said message, and of the relationship existing: between said parties; and if you further believe that said Mrs. N. E. Foster promised and agreed with plaintiff’s wife and A. C. Evans, or with either of them, to’deliver said message to said A. C. Evans when it should be-delivered to her; and if you further believe that defendant’s agent at. Mount Vernon did not deliver said message to said N. E. Foster; and if you further believe that if said message had been delivered to said Mrs. N- E, Foster, she could and would have delivered the same to said A. C. <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>Evans in time for plaintiff’s wife to have reached the bedside of said Luther Evans before his death; and if you further find that by reason of the failure of defendant’s agent at Mount Vernon to deliver said message to Mrs. Foster, plaintiff’s wife was deprived of the opportunity and privilege of reaching the said Luther and seeing him before he died, then, in addition to the amount of money paid for the transmission and delivery of said message, plaintiff would be entitled to recover such additional sum, if any, as the evidence may show would be a fair and just compensation for the mental pain and anguish suffered by plaintiff’s said wife, if she did so suffer, on account of her failure to reach the said Luther before he died.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b83-4" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[172,872,1302,585]]]'>The foregoing instruction is founded upon allegations in the plaintiff’s petition, supported by evidence which the jury were authorized to believe, and which we conclude they did believe, to the effect, that in anticipation of the message in question, and with knowledge of the sickness of Luther Evans and of the relationship of the several parties, and of the extent to which the movements of the mother, Mary C. Evans, and of the brother, A. C. Evans, depended upon the prompt delivery of the telegram, the agent of the company at Mount Vernon agreed with A. C. Evans, that upon receipt of the message he would promptly deliver it to Mrs. Foster, who resided in close proximity to the defendant’s office. It was further alleged and proved that this agreement was not complied with, and hence the delay complained of.</p>
    <p id="b83-5" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[172,1468,1304,578]]]'>This agreement with the agent at Mount Vernon had with A. C. Evans, a beneficiary in the message sent from Gainesville, must, we think, be considered a part of the contract entered into with the company with reference to the transmission and delivery of the telegram. The agreement is relied upon in the petition as a ground of recovery. The defendant, in its pleadings, does not assail it as being without consideration; nor do we think it thus assailable. The agreement, giving shape and direction to the manner of delivery at Mount Vernon, only facilitated the task of the company in effecting the delivery at this point, in accordance with the very terms of the message. We see no substantial reason excluding such an agreement from the scope of the authority of the agent at Mount Vernon.</p>

Under the evidence, however, we do not think that this hypothetical error could possibly have injured the appellant; because, conceding the fact of the agreement to deliver to Mrs. Foster (and this issue is in a preceding sentence of the criticised paragraph properly submitted to the jury), the testimony fails to disclose any effort <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>whatever by the appellant to comply with the agreement.

    <p id="b84-4" data-blocks='[["BL_84.6",84,[310,827,1299,537]]]'>The allegations of the plaintiff’s petition, supported by evidence, show, in effect, not only that A. C. Evans and Mary C. Evans were the beneficiaries in the message declared upon, but that in sending the message W. A. Evans was acting as the agent of A. C. Evans, his son, and of his wife, Mary C. Evans, mother of A. C. Evans and of the sick son, Luther Evans, and that the relationship of the parties and the urgent importance of the telegram were expressly called to the attention of the company’s agent at Gainesville. The language of the message was itself sufficient to challenge the attention of the company to its purpose and scope. The complaint is without merit. Tel. Co. v. Adams, 75 Texas, 531; Tel. Co. v. Jones, 81 Texas, 271; Tel. Co. v. Carter, 85 Texas, 580.</p>

    <p id="b84-6" data-blocks='[["BL_84.8",84,[308,1526,1299,189]]]'>The doctrine, that mental anguish, in the absence of physical pain or pecuniary loss, can be considered as an element of actual damages in cases of this character, is too thoroughly fixed in the jurisprudence of this State to justify its disturbance by this court.</p>
