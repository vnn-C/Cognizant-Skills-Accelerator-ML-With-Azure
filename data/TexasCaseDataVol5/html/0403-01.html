Edwards and his wife. Edwards died in 1834, and his undivided half-interest in the certificate descended to Marcus, Leonidas, and Virginia, the children of him and his surviving wife, Esther. Marcus died in 1854, intestate and without wife or issue. Leonidas died in 1852, leaving his widow, now Mary A. Sanders, and his daughter, now Cora E. Williams. In 1851, Esther, the surviving wife of Thomas F. Edwards, and Virginia, for the <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>services of John L. Farquhar in locating the certificate and procuring patent upon the league and labor of land, conveyed to him by warranty deed an undivided interest of 2300 acres in the land. In July, 1856, a partition was made by Farquhar and said Esther and Virginia, whereby the north half of said tract of land was set apart to Farquhar, and the south half, in subdivisions, to Esther and the heirs.

      <em>Conclusions of Law. </em>— 1. At the death of Thomas F. Edwards, the certificate was community property between him and his wife, Esther, and his undivided half descended to his children.</p>

At that time Mrs. Esther Cummings (formerly Mrs. Edwards) and her daughter, Mrs. Virginia Hurst (now appellant Virginia Lemonds), unquestionably owned two-thirds of the entire tract, and a conveyance of an undivided interest of 2300 acres was valid and binding, and fixed title in Farquhar for that much of the land, whatever might be the interest left in the grantors, and whatever might be the equities- between these and the other heirs of Thomas F. Edwards, deceased, who did not join in the conveyance.</p>

Farquhar and said Esther and Virginia (who were joined by their husbands), Marcus C.

Farquhar by them, even if all of that should be charged to them), about 1340 acres; but if the locative interest should be taken out of the interests of all of the heirs, they would have together about 1725 acres.</p>

There can be no question that the 2300 acres partitioned to James L. Farquhar was fully ratified by all of the heirs; and after their long acquiescence therein, and acceptance and appropriation to their own use of the portion set apart to them, as well as the portion set apart to the widow after her death, they can not foe allowed, after this great lapse of time, to set it aside.

If appellants Cora Williams and Mrs. Sanders did not desire to ratify the partition as made, giving the widow so large an interest in the south half, after setting apart the north half of Farquhar, they could have settled the matter by a repartition of the entire tract, or by an equitable distribution of the south half among themselves, so as to have charged the interest of the widow and the interest of Virginia with 2300 acres deeded and partitioned to Farquhar; but to allow them now to be heard in an action of trespass to try title for a small portion of the north half, after such acquiescence and acts of estoppel, when they themselves have rendered it impossible to do equity, would be equivalent to a fraud. Even a sale by one tenant in common of a distinct part of a larger tract of land will be protected, and the part so sold set apart to the vendor, where it does not exceed the share to which.the cotenant vendor was entitled, and the equities among the tenants in common should be adjusted out of the remainder of the tract, if it can be done.
