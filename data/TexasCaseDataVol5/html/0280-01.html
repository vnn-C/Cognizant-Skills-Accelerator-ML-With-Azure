To establish the relationship of Salome to the grantor, Francisco Leal, the evidence of her son Patricio, as to statements by or information derived from her and her husband, was introduced. Was this testimony admissible ?</p>
    <p id="b309-6" data-blocks='[["BL_309.5",309,[166,1115,1300,528]]]'>A well recognized exception to the use of hearsay evidence exists when pedigree or relationship is the object of proof. Statements or declarations emanating from a member of a family, the declarant being shown to be deceased, concerning the family pedigree, are competent evidence. The rule had its origin in necessity, growing out of the obvious difficulty of proving such matters as they existed at a remote period, and the presumed inability of the parties to obtain better testimony. As we understand the authorities, the only conditions annexed to this species of testimony is, that the declarant must be shown to be dead, and that the declarations appear to have been made before the particular controversy arose.</p>
    <p id="b309-7" data-blocks='[["BL_309.6",309,[167,1663,1300,683]]]'>Appellees contend that there is another prerequisite to such testimony, namely, that the declarant must be shown to have been related to the family. This is correct. If it appear that the person whose declaration is offered was not connected with the family, the declaration would not come within the rule. But the declarations of a person, offered to show pedigree, appear to have been considered in this State effective to prove the relationship of the declarant also. Louder v. Schluter, 78 Texas, 105; Fowler v. Simpson, 79 Texas, 614. If the person back to whom pedigree is sought to be traced died at a very remote period, it is difficult to see how such testimony could be used, for it would be equally difficult to prove the relationship of the declarant. There is high authority, however, that the fact that the declarant was connected with the family must be shown by evidence independent of the declaration. Fulkerson v. Holmes, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20U.S.%20397" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="117 U.S. 397">117 U. S., 397</a>; Wood’s Prac. Ev., sec. 98.</p>

Defendants used in evidence a deed from Volente Perez, Felipe Perez, and Romana Perez to Frank J. McMurray, affecting the grantors as ‘ <em>‘ </em>heirs and legal descendants of Francisco Leal, now deceased, being children of Miguela, daughter of said Francisco Leal and wife of Alejo Perez.” This is reiterated in other of defendants’ muniments of title. In the evidence of Patricio de Leon we have testimony of a fact, fairly in his personal knowledge, that Miguela and Salome were sisters, and thus it is made to appear that Salome was a daughter of Francisco Leal, without any resort to the declarations of Salome. This would admit the declarations of Salome, and at the same time render them superfluous. All things considered, we are constrained to say, that the testimony before the jury to show that plaintiffs were descendants of Francisco Leal was both competent and convincing; and standing alone, it follows that the jury found against the evidence in resolving the issue of heirship adverse to Mrs. Lozano, and this requires a reversal of the judgment.</p>

It is conceded by appellants that all the conditions existed to create a title by limitations (except as against Mrs. Lozano, who had been since August 24, 1867, a married woman) but for the fact of cotenancy, and we must dispose of this branch of the cause in the light of that relation, which, it seems, did originally subsist between the children of Miguela Perez, under whom defendants claim title, and the descedants of Salome de Leon, who are the plaintiffs in the suit.</p>

All this, however, would not be deemed adverse against those who stood, as to them, in the relation of cotenants. <em>No </em>question is better settled than that the possession, under the circumstances above indicated, of a tenant in common will be presumed to be in right of the common title.

In connection with the subsequent deeds, which contain a continuous reference to defendants’ original grantors as the heirs of Francisco Leal, it would be going too far to say that a condition of things did not exist, at the latest in 1883, which would create by necessary implication notice to plaintiffs that the possession was hostile to their title.</p>

He erred in allowing the verdict to stand against "Mrs. Lozano, because her heirship was established by competent uncontradicted testimony, and limitations had not affected her. It would have been error to relieve the jury from the task of rendering the necessary verdict in respect to limitations; but as the whole charge is not given in the record, the court may have directed the proper finding.
