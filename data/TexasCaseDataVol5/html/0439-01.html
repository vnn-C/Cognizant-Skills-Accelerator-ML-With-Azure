Administration de Bonis Non. — In 1859, A. sold land to B., receiving therefor $645 in cash, and three notes for $645 each. B. died. In 18G9, the notes were presented to his administrator, and were allowed by him and approved by the court as a vendor’s lien on the land, and subsequently the land was ordered to be sold, and all but one lot was sold, and bought by A. for a less amount than his debt. The sale was confirmed, and the administrator ordered to make conveyance to the purchaser, but the administrator died in 1874, before making it, and from November, 1873, until 1892, no proceedings were had in court pertaining to the estate of B. The records do not show that the estate of B. had ever been closed, and an application for letters of administration, de bonis non made in 1892 was properly granted, and the administrator de bonis non could, under order of the court, properly make to the heirs of A. the deed which his predecessor had been ordered to make to A.</p>

Adams, one of the appellants, filed in the County Court of Galveston County application for letters of administration de bonis non on the estate of John B. Richardson, deceased, to issue to M. C. McLemore, Jr.; alleging that original letters issued to Mary C. Harding, who was removed on account of her failure to file inventory; that letters then issued to W. H. Hayes, who filed an inventory of the property of the estate, consisting of lots 458, 468, 475, 476, 487, 488, 495, and 496 in section 1, and 6, 7, 14, and 15 in section 2, on Galveston Island, in Galveston County, making in all 129.1 acres. <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>of land; that C. B. Adams, petitioner’s father, sold said land and conveyed the same to said John B. Richardson, by deed dated December 1, 1859, for the consideration of 8645, cash paid, and Richardson’s three notes for $645 each, due in one, two, and three years, and bearing interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum from December 1, 1859; that his father presented in due form his claim, based on said notes, against said estate, which was allowed by the administrator and approved by the court, July 20, 1869, for $1935, with 10 per cent interest from December 1, 1859, and as a vendor’s lien on said land; that the land was subsequently ordered to be sold by the court, lot 488 being omitted by mistake. Lots numbers 455, 468, 475, 476, 487, 495, and 496, in section 1, sold to C. B. Adams for $1145, and lots 6, 7, 14, and 15 sold to C. B. Adams for $400. The sale was reported to the court, confirmed, and the administrator ordered to make conveyance to the purchaser, and the administrator subsequently allowed $120 for services, to be paid by the purchaser of the property, and the balance to be credited on Adams’ claim, and the administrator again ordered to make the conveyance to the purchaser; that the administrator died without making the conveyance. The property did not sell for sufficient to satisfy Adams’ claim, and the mistake in omitting lot 488 was never corrected; that the only property remaining belonging to Richardson’s estate is said lot 488; that it does not appear from the record that the administration has been closed.</p>

The land was not sold on the day named in the order of the court, and upon application of the administrator the order was reversed, and the day of sale was fixed for the first Tuesday in March, 1870; and the order of the court confirming the sale made in pursuance of the last recited order, on the 4th of March, A. D. 1870, directed that the administrator make deed to Adams for the land, upon his compliance with the terms of sale, and, that the amount of the sale, to-wit, $1245, be credited by Adams upon his claim; but this order for compensation does not name or fix the amount due to the administrator for making the sale. The report shows that all of the lots embraced in the tract of land, save one, were sold and purchased by Adams. The administrator did not make the conveyance as directed, and made no further report to the court until November, 1873, when, in response to a citation from the court, he reported that no other property had ever <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>come into his hands belonging to his intestate, save that which he, under order of the court, had sold to Adams in March, 1870; that neither Adams nor any one for him had made an offer to comply with said sale; and upon this report the court again ordered that the administrator make the conveyance to Adams upon his paying the costs of administration, and paying to the administrator the sum of §120, the amount fixed by the court as thé compensation of the administrator for making the sale. The administrator died in January, 1874, without making the conveyance, and from November, 1873, until the filing of appellant’s application, in April, 1892, for the appointment of an administrator de bonis non, no proceedings were had in said court pertaining to the estate of Richardson. Adams sold a portion of the property, to-wit, lots 476, 487, and 496, in section 1, on the 25th day of August, 1884, by deed of warranty, to Julia Kaufman; and Adams died in 1885, intestate, owing no debts, and there was no necessity for administration upon his estate; that his heirs are appellants herein, and that they sold, on the 5th of March, 1887, to said Kaufman, by deed of warranty, lots 6 and 15, in section 2, and said lots were all subsequently conveyed by Kaufman to Clara Kaufman. Appellants were ignorant of the fact, until a short time before they filed their application for the appointment of an administrator de bonis non, that the deceased administrator, Hayes, had failed to make a conveyance of the property to the purchaser, as he was ordered to do in March, 1870, and in November, 1873. It was agreed by the parties herein that Hayes was the duly appointed administrator de bonis non of the estate of Richardson.</p>

B. Richardson, deceased, to M. C. McLemore, Jr., and in refusing the application of appellants to order said McLemore to make conveyance to them of the property sold to Charles C. Adams by the administrator of the estate of J. B. Richardson, in March, A. D. 1870, in obedience to an order of the Probate Court of Galveston County, made on the 31st of January, A. D. 1870; and that <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>the District Court of Galveston County also erred in refusing to make such order. The land was sold by order of the court, 1870, for the payment of the established claim of Adams against the estate of Richardson, said claim being secured by vendor’s lien on the land, previously established by judgment of said court. Adams did not therefore occupy the position of a purchaser without interest in the sale. When the sale was made to him for less than his claim, and the sale approved by the court, his claim against the estate was, pro tanto, paid, and he acquired an equitable title to the land, subject to a lien for the payment of the costs of the sale; and the administrator could have compelled him to pay such costs.</p>
