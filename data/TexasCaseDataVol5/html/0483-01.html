M. and A.F.M. as defendants charged them with liability as makers of the note sued on. E. A. M. pleaded that she was the wife of A. F. M., and as such was not liable on the note. Plaintiff, by supplemental, petition, replied, that under the laws of Iowa, where the note was executed, and the parties all resided, and under the facts in the case, stating them, she. was liable on the note. <em>Held, </em>that this matter was properly pleaded in avoidance, and the court thereupon properly submitted to the jury the question of the wife’s liability under the facts alleged in the replication and shown in evidence.</p>

The payees in the notes were also merchants there, and the appellee, a banking corporation, was there engaged in business. According to the laws of Iowa, a married woman could, when the notes were executed and when this cause was. tried, operate, manage, and own a mercantile business as could a feme sole, and could so contract debts, her separate property being liable for her debts.</p>

    <p id="b511-12" data-blocks='[["BL_511.10",511,[190,1979,1296,339]]]'>Opinion.— 1. We do not concur with appellant in the first assignment of error, that to maintain jurisdiction in the court to foreclose the attachment lien upon the real estate alleged in the petition to be the property of Mrs. E. A. Merrilles, it was necessary that the plaintiff should prove the title to the property to be in fact in her. If the title was in some other person, the decree was a nullity as to the true owner, not a party to the proceeding. This was a proceeding “ in rem.”</p>

The right to exercise jurisdiction with reference to the property depends upon whether it has <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>been subjected to the control of the court by appropriate method. Attachment is such a method. Campbell v. Wilson, 6 Texas, 379; Battle v. Carter, 44 Texas, 485.</p>
    <p id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.4",512,[289,482,1302,280]]]'>2. In the original petition liability was charged against the two defendants, E. A. Merrielles and A. F. Merrielles, as drawers of the notes, without an allegation that the relation of husband and wife existed between them. The appellant pleaded that E. A. Merrielles was the wife of her codefendant, and that as a married woman she was not liable on the notes.</p>
    <p id="b512-6" data-blocks='[["BL_512.5",512,[289,782,1302,285]]]'>To this plea the plaintiff, by supplemental petition, replied, that though a married woman, E. A. Merrielles was as such, under the laws of-Iowa, authorized in her own name and as to her separate property to manage a general mercantile business, and that, so engaged, she executed the notes sued upon, being fully empowered by the laws of Iowa to so bind herself and her separate property.</p>
    <p id="b512-7" data-blocks='[["BL_512.6",512,[288,1080,1301,289]]]'>We think the charge of the court submitting the question of the liability of E. A. Merrielles, under the facts alleged in replication, was proper. The allegations of the supplemental petition, consonant with the purpose and scope of that pleading, were “ in avoidance of the matters of defense pleaded in the answer.” We therefore overrule appellant’s second assignment of error.</p>
    <p id="b512-8" data-blocks='[["BL_512.7",512,[286,1380,1302,228]]]'>3. The remarks under the first assignment of error as to the character of this proceeding and the source of jurisdiction in this case constrain us to overrule appellant’s third assignment, to the effect that the court erred in submitting the case to the jury without jurisdiction over the person of the husband.</p>
    <p id="b512-9" data-blocks='[["BL_512.8",512,[288,1627,1300,241]]]'>4.

    <p id="b512-10" data-blocks='[["BL_512.9",512,[288,1878,1300,239]]]'>Without undertaking an extended discussion of this question, we express the conclusion that the court correctly applied the law of Iowa, the “lex loci contractus,” in the enforcement of the obligations in suit. This action, we think, was justified by the views of our Supreme Court in Ryan v. Railway, 65 Texas, 13, et seq.</p>

The verdict, the form of which we have already stated, was sufficiently definite to authorize the entry of judgment against E. A. Merrielles, with a foreclosure of the lien sought in the pleadings, against her property exclusively. The verdict will be read in the light of the plead<a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>ings, in which no judgment of any character was sought against the husband.</p>

    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[198,431,1300,480]]]'>7. The concluding assignment is founded upon the nullity of the attachment proceedings, alleged to be due to the want of an affidavit for attachment. The validity of these proceedings was in no way questioned in the trial court. The defect here relied upon consists in the omission of the word “ sworn,” or an equivalent word, in the affidavit. It is altogether probable that if the objection had been urged in the trial court it would have been met by accounting for and supplying the omission, probably due purely to clerical misprision. A motion to quash urged for the first time in a revisory court is not, we think, entitled to consideration.</p>
