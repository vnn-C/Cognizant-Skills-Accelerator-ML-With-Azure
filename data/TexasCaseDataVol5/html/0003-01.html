In the motion for a new trial, which was verified by the affidavit of appellants’ attorney, it was alleged, that the judge trying the case was in possession of and claiming title to the land in controversy under a title adverse to that of appellants; and that appellants’ counsel was not aware of this until after the trial had begun and the case was nearly disposed of, when he was made acquainted with the facts by the judge.</p>

The question for us to determine, then, is, was he “ interested ’ ’ within the meaning of that word as used in our Constitution? Const., art. 5, sec. 11.</p>
    <p id="b30-3" data-blocks='[["BL_30.4",30,[296,546,1310,337]]]'>That the person in possession of land had an interest in the result of an ejectment suit, though not a party thereto, was recognized by the English courts in the early history of that action. In order to prevent the abuses resulting from “clandestine ejectments,” the rule was established, that no plaintiff should proceed in ejectment to recover the land against a casual ejector, unless notice of the suit was first given to the. tenant in possession.</p>
    <p id="b30-4" data-blocks='[["BL_30.5",30,[294,896,1299,932]]]'>The principle of this ancient and wholesome rule is still recognized in our action of trespass to try title, substituted for that of ejectment. Article 4790 of the Revised Statutes provides: “The. defendant in the action shall be the person in possession, if the premises are occupied, or some person claiming title thereto, in case they are unoccupied.” It may be urged that the occupant’s title can not be affected by a suit to which he is not a party, and that the judgment therein would not conclude his rights when set up in another suit. Neither was the judgment in the action of ejectment conclusive upon the title or right of property, even between the parties; but as each ouster was a separate trespass, the action could be repeated and the same question retried indefinitely. The possession only was recovered. And yet, two centuries ago, Chief Justice Holt deemed it a precedent worthy of perpetuation in law literature, that “ The mayor of Hereford was laid by the heels for sitting in judgment in a case where he himself was lessor of the plaintiff in ejectment, though he, by the charter, was sole judge of the court.” It will be remembered that the lessor of the plaintiff was not a party to the suit, though his title was the foundation to the action, which was brought in the name of the lessee to recover the possession.</p>

It is sufficient if he is in anywise interested in the subject matter.” <a href="/citations/?q=23%20Ala.%2091" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="23 Ala. 91">23 Ala., 91</a>.</p>

The immediate rights of the litigants are not the only objects of the rule.

    <p id="b31-5" data-blocks='[["BL_31.5",31,[162,587,1302,428]]]'>It seems to us that a judge ought not to try the title to land which he himself claims to own and is in possession of, holding adversely to one of the litigants; and that the failure of the plaintiff (through ignorance) to make him a party defendant, as he should have done, ought not to change the rule. In this particular case, however, no harm was done appellant, as the court decided the case correctly on the merits, as heretofore held in a similar case (Marsalis v. Creager, 2 Texas Civil Appeals, 368); but solely for the reason that he was disqualified, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>
