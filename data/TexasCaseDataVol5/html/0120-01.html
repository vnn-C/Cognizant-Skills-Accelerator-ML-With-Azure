At the time of the making of said contract, which was on the-day of May, 1889, there was then pending in the County Probate Court of Milam County an application by A. D. and James Terry to probate the will of their father, M. Terry, deceased. Said will made said parties, A. D. and James Terry, the legatees of his estate, valued at $47,000. Said will and the probate thereof was contested by Jake French, plaintiff, on his behalf and others, children, his brothers and sisters, grandchildren of said M. Terry, and by others, children of said M. Terry by his first wife, the latter being half brothers and sisters of said A. D. and James Terry, and their descendants. Said French heirs claimed, that in a partition of the estate between M. Terry and his first wife, their mother did not receive $500, to which she was justly entitled, and they claim that said $500 was one of the inducements to and a part of the considerations for the contract alleged to have been made between Jake French and A. D. and James Terry.</blockquote>

Terry should come into the hands of A. D. and James Terry, they were to pay him $2500. That same was not to be made a charge against the estate, but was to be paid by A.

D. and James Terry would agree to allow that claim without contest after they had qualified as executors, or administrators with will annexed, of M. Terry’s estate, the whole matter could be settled and the contest would be withdrawn. That said Jake French, in pursuance of an arrangement with A. D. and James Terry, went back and informed said A.

Terry, if they would withdraw their contest to its probation. The finding of the court is that the contract declared on is found to be proven as alleged; this, in effect, being a finding in favor of the plaintiffs upon the questions presented by the plea in abatement. We believe that the other finding of the court, to the effect that the contract with the appellants was entered <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>into by them and Jake French, one of the appellees, while it may appear to be inconsistent with the finding that the contract was entered into with “all of the plaintiffs as alleged,” may be rendered consistent with such finding, upon the idea that Jake French was acting not alone for himself, but for all of the plaintiffs, in making the contract. Looking to the allegations of the petition and the judgment of the court, we think that the apparent conflict between the findings of the court upon this branch of the case can be reconciled, upon the theory that Jake French was acting for all of the plaintiffs in entering into the engagement with the appellant^, and that the court below really viewed the matter in that light.</p>
    <p id="b150-5" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[304,831,1302,137]]]'>Appellants’ fifth assignment of error complains, that the judgment below is erroneous, because there is a variance between the contract as declared on and the one proven and found by the court.</p>

    <p id="b150-7" data-blocks='[["BL_150.6",150,[303,1080,1304,682]]]'>The liability of the appellants to pay the sum agreed upon arose when the will was probated; this is the allegation of the petition. The court finds, that the amount sued for was by the contract not to be made a charge against the estate, but was to be paid by the appellants individually, and that the amount was to be paid when the will was probated and when the property came into the hands of the appellants. There is a finding to the effect that the property did come into their possession in June, 1889 (prior to the filing of this suit), and a finding that the will was duly probated. The conditions that impose liability, as stated either by the averments of the petition or by the evidence, are found to exist by the court. If the liability to pay arose when the will was probated, then the court finds that it was probated; and if it arose when the will was probated and when the estate came into the possession of the appellants, it finds such facts to exist.</p>
    <p id="b150-8" data-blocks='[["BL_150.7",150,[301,1777,1303,535]]]'>The petition may not have stated the entire terms of the .contract as shown by the evidence; and if the evidence went further, and established conditions that were not fully pleaded, but were not variant from those that were alleged, we do not think that this would necessarily create a variance between the contract pleaded and that proven. It would be a case, not of a want of description of the contract declared on, but one simply of an imperfect description. The allegation descriptive of the contract is good as far as it goes, and if it does not include all of the terms of the contract, but enough to identify it with the one in proof, it should not be said that there is a material variance between the contract alleged and that established by the evidence.</p>
