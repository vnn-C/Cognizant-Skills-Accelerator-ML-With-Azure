Conversion of Mortgaged Property — Nonresident.—When a nonresident debtor has property in this State, a resident creditor can proceed directly against the property to collect his debt; and where a third party converts to his own Use property on which there is a lien, the creditor can proceed against him for the value of the property, not to exceed a sufficient amount to pay such debt.</p>

The act of the defendant in converting said property to his own use is a trespass; and appellant being thereby unable to foreclose his lien on said property, may bring his action for the trespass, sue for the conversion of the property, or waive the last and sue for money had and received, as against the defendant, who was a wrongdoer. The plaintiff was entitled to the possession of said property, out of which to satisfy his lien. Veck v. Holt, 71 Texas, 715; 1 Add. on Torts, 544.</p>
    <p id="b435-6" data-blocks='[["BL_435.7",435,[184,863,1300,536]]]'>2. The court erred in sustaining special exceptions to plaintiff’s amended account, wherein it is contended that said account is bad, because the same fails to show defendant in possession of any portion of the mortgaged cotton, and because the mortgagor is not a party to this suit; because the plaintiff in this case is not seeking to foreclose said mortgage, but really attempting to recover the same from a tort feasor, or who, himself being a trespasser, has no right to demand that Delk be made a party to this suit. Delk does not become a necessary party to any suit until the plaintiff seeks to foreclose his lien against Delk, which he is not doing in this case. Boydston v. Morris, 71 Texas, 698; Veck v. Holt, 71 Texas, 715; 1 Add. on Torts, 544-548.</p>
