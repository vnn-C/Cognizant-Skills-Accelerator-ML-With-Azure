Lipscomb, the defendant, in 1889, and for some years prior thereto. Mr. Lipscomb was manager of the Franklin Co-operative Association, doing business in Franklin. Sometime in the fall of 1888 or spring of 1889 I left with Mr. Lipscomb for safe keeping a note for $250. When it matured it had accumulated <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>$25, making in all $275. The note was made payable to me as guardian for my minor children. Their names were all mentioned in the body of the note. I was guardian of my minor children, appointed by the County Court of Robertson County, and the note above mentioned was given by Tobe Johnson, of Fort Worth, Texas, in part payment of the purchase money of a tract of land that I had sold him, as guardian of the estate of my minor children. I had sold the land for $800, had received $300 cash, and two notes for $250 each, payable in one and two years, with 10 per cent interest. I paid out the $300 to the heirs who were of age, and took their receipts, and I turned the notes and receipts over to S. J. Lipscomb, to be put in his iron safe for safe keeping, because I had confidence in him, and he was my bondsman. When I collected the first note I paid it out to two of the heirs who had become of age, and took their receipts, and to the older heirs, and took their receipts, and had Lipscomb place them with the other papers.</blockquote>

Lipscomb for it, and he told me he had already sent it off for collection. I thought strange of this, as I had not authorized him to sign my name, and next time I came to town he told me the money had come and he had placed it in Decherd’s bank. I told him to get it, as I wished to pay Mr. Moore, one of the heirs. He went and got the money and handed me $108, the amount then due the heirs, and told me, as Mr. Moore was indebted to the association, that he preferred I would settle with him somewhere else, as, if he was settled with there, it. might look like it was done with the purpose to collect the debt. I took the money, and went to Mr. Kellogg’s and paid Mr. Moore $33, his share, and took his receipt. I left the balance of $167 with Mr. Lipscomb in the safe. I did not want to take the money home with me, and so left it with him for safe keeping, and told him to give me a receipt for it, which he did. (Receipt was here exhibited to Wtness.) That is the receipt Mr. Lipscomb gave to me, and it shows Mr. Lipscomb collected $275 and paid me $108, and that at the date of the receipt he owed me $167 on this deposit, and he owes me this $167 now. I have frequently asked him for this money, and he always told me he would see that I got it. I might have asked him for this money one or two months after the date of the receipt. I am not certain as to the time. I did not place this note with Mr. Lipscomb to be used in the business of the association, neither did I authorize Mr. Lipscomb to collect the note, and when I left the money with him it was for safe keeping, he being my bondsman, and not to be used in the business. Lipscomb knew that this money belonged to minor children, and that I had no authority to lend it. Sometime in January, 1889, I had assisted the association, and turned over to Mr. Lipscomb $50 in cash to be used in the business, and I also turned over to him a note on John Drennan for $201.90. I let him (Mr. Lipscomb) have the Drennan note to put in <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>the bank as collateral to borrow money to be used in the business. I told Lipscomb then not to cash that note, but to place it as collateral, but as soon as I had endorsed said note and delivered it to him, he cashed it. He gave me a receipt for the Drennan note.</blockquote>

I left it there for safe keeping, and told him to give me a receipt, which he did. I did not read the receipt, because my eyes were bad, and I had not read a receipt for ten years on account of my eyes, and, in addition, I then had confidence in Lipscomb. Mr. Lipscomb had no authority from me to use the money. It was to be paid back to me whenever I demanded it. I do not know when I first demanded it. It might have been one month or two months after I left it there, or it might have been longer. I know I demanded it in April, 1890, when the association suspended. He always told me that he,would see that I got it. He told me, that when crowded by creditors he always went to the safe and got any money he found there. I did not care what money I got back, so I got good money back. I am a stockholder in the Franklin Co-operative Association, and in 1889 and 1890 was also one of the directors. I do not know whether the association is solvent or not; there are enough good claims on the books if when collected to pay all the debts. The bulk of the stockholders are solvent men, but they are only bound to the amount of their stock, and they will lose all their stock. Mr. Lipscomb had no authority from the board of directors to receive money on deposit and issue deposit slips, nor to negotiate and hypothecate notes as manager of the Franklin Co-operative Association, and if he used the money that I left there in paying the debts of the association, he acted without any authority. I did not read the receipt; my eyes were bad, and I had confidence in Lipscomb, and had not read a receipt for ten years. I have known Mr. Lipscomb a long time, and had the utmost confidence in him up to that time. Mr. Lipscomb gave me the receipt on June 4, 1889, and it was on that day that I settled with Mr. Moore.</blockquote>
