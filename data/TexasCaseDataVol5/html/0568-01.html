It is true that the house was one constructed of <em>“ </em>mesquite pickets stuck in the ground and covered with grass,” but it was the home of appellant for sixteen years, and under its thatched roof he and his wife had reared a family of children, and it was permanent enough to shelter Ms family during the long years, and to proclaim to the world that he had made his habitation and abiding place there. Here he had also constructed a rude fence about some 25 acres of the land, and had during his sixteen years possession cultivated it and enjoyed its fruits, claiming <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>

Upon the construction placed on the testimony of appellee rests the decision of the case. Appellant showed by irrefragable proof that he had for sixteen years been in open, continuous adverse possession of the land under deeds from Jose Musquiz, which were not recorded, and he had obtained a perfect legal title to the land by prescription to the whole of the land, unless the fact of his coming into the office of appellee with Musquiz and wife to have a deed made by them to one-half of it was an admission on his part that as to one-half of the land he had not been holding adversely to Musquiz and wife. There can be no doubt that the acts and declarations of a claimant to land under and by prescription, made after the bar of the statute, are admissible to show that possession of the land was not adverse.

It will not be argued for a moment that his acts could be used to show that he had parted with a title to half the land by his acts and declarations, any more than it could be done if he had a perfect and unbroken chain of title.</p>

In addition, the party holding by limitation was an agent of the true owner, and told the latter before the suit that he would not think of pleading the statute against him. But he did it, and did it successfully. In these cases the motive in making the offers controlled the decision of the case, a desire to compromise not being deemed an admission that the possession was not hostile to the owner of the paper title.</p>

It is often a serious and difficult matter to arrive at motive and intent when all the facts and circumstances touching it are brought out fully and succinctly, and it becomes much more so when as imperfect a statement of facts is presented as confronts us in this case. Neither Musquiz nor wife are put upon the witness stand, and no witness testifies in regard to the visits of Musquiz and wife and appellant 'to appellee’s office to have the deed written, except the appellee. What the consideration for the deed was to be is nowhere indicated, and whether Musquiz’s claim to one-half the land was recognized, and this deed was to cover the balance, is not shown. No conversation that was held at the time is proven, and appellee says that he did not inquire what interest Cuellar had in the land, nor as to who was in possession, although he must have known Cuellar was in possession, as he swears that Musquiz and wife “ employed me to bring suit to put Cuellar off the premises and recover possession.”</p>

I have a wife and nine children, all of whom have been raised on this place.” Juan Pablo Talamantes, a witness for appellant swears: “ I am acquainted with the Musquiz pre-emption in Bexar County, the land in controversy in this suit. Mr. Jesus Cuellar has lived on it continuously since 1875, and has used and claimed it as his homestead.” Antonio Yasquez says: “ Mr. Cuellar has continuously lived on said pre-emption since 1875 up to this date, and has cultivated, claimed, and used the same as his homestead all during this time.” Mrs. Sarah A. Lockhart swears, that “from 1875 to 1887 I lived on a place adjoining the land in controversy. I <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>am acquainted with Mr. Jesus Cuellar, the defendant. I knew him in 1875, and know that he has lived on the tract of land in controversy from 1875 until I moved away from my place in 1887.

Must this act <em>be </em>construed as an evidence that his occupancy of the land had not been adverse, when he swears positively that it was adverse ? May not his act have been the outgrowth of other motives than that of a confession that he had no title ? There is no consideration shown for the transaction, and the testimony impresses us with the conviction that the whole transaction was one of an attempted compromise, actuated by a desire on-Cuellar’s part to avoid litigation and remove a supposed cloud from his title. There is nothing in the evidence to indicate any recognition of a superior title in appellee or his vendors. There was no element of purchase in the transaction, but rather one of seeking peace, avoiding strife, and shunning vexatious' litigation. Musquiz had twice deeded to the appellant the whole of the land, and he had occupied adversely to the world, 'and the one act of seeming willingness to accept another deed from Musquiz does not establish that he had not held adverse possession of the land which he had bought and paid for.</p>

The first ground is, ‘ <em>‘ </em>that the court erred in finding that the affidavits filed to obtain a patent were in compliance with law, and that the appellant had perfected his title <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>by ten years limitation, because the affidavits refer to a different piece of land from that in controversy in this suit.” We are unable to comprehend the force of this ground for a rehearing. The Musquiz title came through the affidavits upon which the patent is based, and appellant claims through that patent. In the patent the land is described as being located about seventeen and one-half miles west of San Antonio, by virtue of an affidavit made on December 28, 1874, and then by metes and bounds describing the land. The affidavit made in 1871 describes the starting point as being at the southwest corner of survey number 23 9¿, and then describes the land as it is described in the patent. The patent describes the starting point as being at the southwest corner of survey number 300¿-, and this it is argued shows that the Land Commissioner granted a patent to a different tract of land from the one applied for by Musquiz. There is no merit in this proposition. There is no question of the identity of the land in the case. Cuellar and his witnesses swear that the land sued for, which is described in the patent, is the same land that Musquiz settled on in 1871, and the same land that Musquiz sold to Cuellar. The affidavit referred to in the patent is that of date December 28, 1874, and that affidavit refers back to the affidavit of 1871. There is no affidavit of date May 28, 1874, as claimed in the argument of counsel. The affidavit of December 28, 1874, refers back to the survey made to the land in May, 1871. Appellee claims through the same affidavit and patent as appellant, and if the affidavit of Musquiz is not the basis of - the patent, as the latter asserts, we can not see how appellee is in a position to be benefited by it. Musquiz was entitled to a patent in 1874, and could have received it by application and paying the necessary fees. Cuellar got the title of Musquiz, and the patent when issued was his.</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[291,1674,1298,777]]]'>As stated in the second ground for rehearing, a party can be estopped by his acts which mislead an innocent party and cause him to part with some right, but the principle does not apply to the facts in this case. Cuellar did not mislead appellee, and, indeed, could not have done it. Appellee is an attorney, and as such was employed by Musquiz to sue Cuellar. He must have known all the facts connected with the case, and certainly could not have been deceived by Cuellar coming into his office when a request was made for him to write a deed for Musquiz to sign. The facts in the case lead us to the conclusion that Cuellar, who was a Mexican, had in some way learned that the patent to the land had been issued in the name of Musquiz, and supposed that he ought to have another deed to the land, and went in company with Musquiz to the office of appellee to get it. This was not sufficient to deceive any one. The facts put appellee fully upon notice that appellant was in possession of the land and claiming it. The doctrine of estoppel has no standing in this case.</p>

Moser, 70 Texas, 42, is con-elusive of this case on the question of limitation running against the wife in case of a homestead not her separate property. Musquiz and wife abandoned the place, and he conveyed it to Cuellar, acting in direct hostility to the homestead rights of the wife. The land was community estate. Kelley v. Whitman, 41 Texas, 647; Simonton v. Mayblum, 59 Texas, 7; Smith v. Uzzell, 61 Texas, 220. There is nothing in Hargadene v. Whitfield, 71 Texas, 488, that is in conflict with this doctrine. The ground for holding that the statute of limitation will run against a wife in the case of a homestead when it is not her separate property is, that she can sue alone for the enforcement of her homestead rights should her husband refuse to join her. If this is a legislative enactment engrafted on the law of limitations, as contended by counsel, this court is in no manner responsible for it. It is a question too well settled by decisions of the Supreme Court for this court to differ from it.</p>
