Telegram — Agent. — A telegraph operator who is requested by the sender to write, and at his dictation writes the message, is acting for the sender and not for the company in preparing the message, and the appellee, to whom the message was addressed, can not complain of his act in writing it upon a form usually used for the purpose, or in making a mistake in writing it down.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b375-7" data-blocks='[["BL_375.6",375,[165,698,1300,445]]]'>2. Contract, Breach of — Jurisdiction.—The form upon which the message was written contained this printed stipulation: “ This company is hereby made the agent of the sender, without liability, to forward any message over the lines of any other company when necessary to reach its destination.” The message was received by appellant at Ladonia. in Fannin County, and was to be transmitted to appellee at Detroit, in Red River County. Appellant had no line extending into Red River County,, and must necessarily have delivered the message to the Western Union Telegraph Company, at Paris, to be by it transmitted to its destination in Red River County. <em>Held, </em>the stipulation above quoted would deprive the courts of Red River County of jurisdiction over appellant in a suit for the breach of the contract.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b375-8" data-blocks='[["BL_375.7",375,[167,1156,1299,201]]]'>3. Same. — If this proposition were not true, still if the operator made a mistake in writing down the message, and addressed it to Detroit, Michigan, instead of Detroit, Texas, the mistake not being chargeable to the company, the contract as thus written would not authorize the court in Red River County to take jurisdiction of appellant in a suit based thereon.</p>

It is error for the court to submit to the jury an issue of fact concerning which there is no conflict in the evidence. When the execution of a contract in writing is clearly proven, and the breach of such contract is a basis of contention, it is the duty of the court to construe the contract according to its plain, unambiguous terms.

Under the pleadings and evidence, the defendant was not liable to be sued in Red River County unless it had entered into a contract in writing to be performed in that county. An illegible writing that can not be understood, and that is not mutually assented to, can not be relied upon as a written contract. If the operator, Daniels, transcribing the illegible message at the request and dictation of the sender, made the message read Detroit, Michigan, instead of Detroit, Texas, defendant would not be liable for such mistake.

If the telegram was so poorly written that the agent of the company could not read it, it was his right and duty to reject it. If the agent attempted to read it, and failed to do so correctly, or if he depended upon some unauthorized person to read it for him, and a mistake was made, it was the mistake of the company, not the sender of the telegram. 6 Wait’s Act. and Def., sec. 7; Gray on Tel., sec. 21.</p>

Further, that on the date aforesaid plaintiff’s wife and child were very sick near Ladonia, in Fannin County, and plaintiff was near Detroit, in Red River County. That C. A.

That said message was delivered to defendant’s operator at Ladonia, and defendant, for the valuable consideration paid to it, then and there obligated itself by <em>its contract made and entered into in </em>writing, to deliver the said telegram at Detroit, Texas; and by a comity between said corporations, and mutual exchange of business, the said agent of the Gulf, Colorado <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Railway Company at Ladonia was authorized to bind both of them by said contract. It is further alleged, that the tele<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>grain was never delivered to plaintiff, on account of negligence of defendants, whereby he suffered damage by reason of his failure to reach his sick child until a short time just prior to its death; for which he sued defendants jointly and severally.</p>
    <p id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[173,518,1299,331]]]'>A demurrer interposed by Western Union Telegraph Company was sustained. The Gulf, Colorado <em>&amp; </em>Santa Fe Railway Company, by exception, raised the question as to the jurisdiction of the court over it, and by plea in abatement asserted its privilege to be sued in a county of its residence, and denied under oath every allegation in plaintiff’s petition tending to confer jurisdiction on the District Court of Red River County over defendant.</p>

Plaintiff’s messenger stated to the operator that he was hot and nervous, and asked the operator to write down the message. The operator wrote down the message on a telegraphic blank as it was dictated to him by the sender, and in that form sent off the message. The form upon which the message was written contained, among others, the following printed stipulation: “ This company is hereby made the agent of <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>the sender, without liability, to forward any message over the lines of any other company when necessary to reach its destination.’ ’ Appellant had no line extending into Red River County, and must necessarily have delivered the message to the Western Union Telegraph Company at Paris, to be by it transmitted to the place of destination in Red River County. The operator in the preparation of the message was acting for the sender, and not the company. The appellee can not therefore complain of his act in writing the message upon the form usually used for the purpose, or in making a mistake in writing down the message at the request and at the dictation of Frensley, the person to whom the sender had committed the matter of having the message sent.
