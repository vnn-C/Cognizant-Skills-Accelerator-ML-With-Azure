After the crop was made, the corn was divided equally, and the cotton was carried by Turner to the gin of Moss <em>&amp; </em>Pennington, who were public ginners, to be prepared for market, and was entered on their gin books in the joint names of Horseley and Turner. At the beginning of the cotton season, Horseley (appellant) notified Moss <em>&amp; </em>Pennington that the cotton was raised on his farm and was his, and that they must not allow it to be removed by Turner, or any one else, without his written order. Shortly afterwards, there were four bales of cotton prepared for market, which Turner promised to haul to Horseley at Greenville, but failing to do so, the latter had it hauled, and sold it. Subsequently the ginners prepared three other bales, which were taken by Turner and sold, and by agreement the proceeds of the seven bales were divided, Horseley being paid §50 upon his claim for advances. Afterwards there were ten other bales prepared by Moss <em>&amp; </em>Pennington, which they delivered to Turner, who sold the same and applied the money to his own use. Horseley, after making formal demand upon the parties, sued Turner and Moss &amp; Pennington for conversion of the ten bales of cotton.

The right of appellant to hold Moss <em>&amp; </em>Pennington responsible jointly with Turner for his interest in the ten bales of cotton could not be taken away by his having accepted from the attorney of Turner a part <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>of the proceeds of the three bales previously taken off by Turner.
