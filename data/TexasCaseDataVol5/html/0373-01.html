The bill of exceptions does not state the ground of the objection nor the ground of the court’s ruling, and is defective; but the deeds from Smith and wife would be the best evidence, and can not be explained by paroi testimony; nor are the reasons of the wife for joining in the conveyances material to any issue in this case.</p>

A. Smith, of his action in the matter, that she objected to it; and that in the next year, when they had moved to Navarro County, that Beaton and Prendergast, on their arrival, tried to get his wife, F.

Powell, in which suit the title to the Friar league was involved. They did so, and the litigation was ended about 1860. The bill of exceptions shows that the witness John R. Smith, who then lived in Gonzales County, learned for the first time in 1868 of his wife’s interest in the Friar league, and in 1869 he executed a deed to Beaton and Prendergast, for himself and as agent for his wife, for the land in controversy. The appellees endeavored to show acts of ratification and estoppel against the wife, and these were issues in the case. The bill of exception shows, <em>“ </em>that at said time, at the request of Beaton and Prendergast, he (Smith) signed the deed to them, signing his own name and his wife Francis A. Smith’s name to said deed.” It was proper for plaintiffs to prove that when the husband reported to Mrs. Smith what he had done, that she objected to it, and that when Beaton and Prendergast endeavored to get her to sign the deed she refused to do so, and has ever since refused.

At that time Francis A. Smith was a married woman, and there was no pretense that such contract was made for her or on her behalf, or that she was in any manner bound by it. The husband had no authority to “ ratify ” any such contract, and bind his wife’s separate estate, fourteen years after it was made, without being joined by her, with privy acknowledgment, as required by law.

    <p id="b406-4" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[304,674,1304,427]]]'>9. The twelfth assignment of error objects to the introduction of the power of attorney from E. J. and A. I. Simpson to W. H. Harris, and to the deed made under it, because, under proper notice from plaintiffs and intervenors, the defendants filed an abstract of their title, not including this power of attorney. The statute requires, where an abstract of title has been demanded and filed, that “ in all cases the documentary evidence of title shall at the trial be confined to the matters contained in the abstract of title.” Rev. Stats., art. 4799. Upon this ground the testimony should have been excluded.</p>
    <p id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.6",406,[300,1122,1304,1383]],["BL_407.1",407,[179,331,1301,190]]]'>But the second ground of objection, that the power of attorney only gave authority to <em>sell </em>and <em>convey for a </em>consideration, and conferred no power upon the agent to make a conveyance without consideration, or in satisfaction of some pre-existing moral obligation, presents a serious question. Powers of attorney must be strictly construed, and the principal will not be bound beyond the plain import of the instrument. Skaggs v. Murchison, 63 Texas, 353; Reese v. Medlock, 27 Texas, 120. In this case the power of attorney of Simpson and wife to Harris gave authority to bargain, sell, and convey land for money, or such other consideration as to the grantee therein may seem to the grantor’s advantage, and to <em>receive the pay or consideration </em>therefor, etc. The deed made under it recites as a consideration the contract made by Clark, as the next friend for the minor heirs of W. H. Harris, with Beaton and Prendergast, in 1855, and the services rendered by them thereunder. Clearly the grantor in the power of attorney contemplated a <em>sale </em>of lands, and a consideration to be paid and received, and not merely a conveyance without consideration. Mrs. Simpson had no connection whatever with the contract between Clark and Beaton and Prendergast, and it created no legal or equitable claim against her or charge upon her estate. Even if it had, this power of attorney did not grant power to Harris to convey her land in settlement of it. Frost v. Erath Cattle Co., 81 Texas, 509, and authorities there cited. If there was any act on the part of E. J. and A. I. Simpson after the execution of this deed which would amount to a ratification or an estoppel, and the deed was unobjectionable in other respects, it might have been properly guarded by the court and considered in connection with such other testimony; otherwise it should have been excluded. The record before us does not disclose any acts of ratification on the part of Mrs. Simpson which could be binding upon a married woman. “ To estop a <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>married woman from asserting her rights to land, it is essential that she should be guilty of some positive act of fraud, or else of some act of concealment or suppression which in law would be equivalent thereto.” Johnson v. Bryan, 62 Texas, 626.</p>
    <p id="b407-3" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[180,532,1302,835]]]'>10. The court correctly charged the jury that William Clark had no power or authority as next friend for the minor heirs of William H. Harris, deceased, to make the contract with Beaton and Prendergast in 1855, agreeing to give them one-fourth of the Friar league of land for their services. The charge, however, was erroneous in that portion which charged that the deed from a portion of the Harris heirs to Beaton and Prendergast was a partition, and upon the subject of the ratification thereof by appellants or their ancestor, Francis A. Smith. The contract of 1855 conveyed nothing whatever, either legal or equitable, and in so far as the heirs were concerned, was wholly void. The services of such attorneys rendered under that contract were in no sense an equitable charge upon the land, and gave them no right whatever to demand any interest therein. The deed from William H. Harris, Jr., J. B. Harris, Theo. M. Kyle, and Emma J. Simpson and husband to Beaton and Prendergast purported to be an original vesting of title in them to the interest of such parties in the tract so conveyed, and was not a partition of land among original part owners.</p>
    <p id="b407-4" data-blocks='[["BL_407.5",407,[184,1379,1300,833]]]'>Appellees’ counsel contend that Beaton and Prendergast had acquired a right to an interest in the Enoch Friar league of land under their contract with William Clark in 1855, and that the subsequent conveyance to them by a portion of the Harris heirs was a <em>partition. </em>But there can be no partition unless the parties to it are part owners in the property. Beaton and Prendergast had no shadow of claim to any part of the Enoch Friar league of land until they procured the same by the deed from a part of the Harris heirs; hence this deed could in no proper sense be called a partition. If this was only a partition deed, it was not effective for any purpose. In the case of Davis v. Agnew, 67 Texas, 213, Judge Stayton says: “A partition of land between one who owns an undivided interest in it and one who owns no interest whatever, is necessarily no partition, and neither confers upon one nor takes from the other any right, it matters not what may be the form of the instrument by which the intent to partition is evidenced. The very basis for partition is co-ownership, and when this does not exist the instrument which attempts partition is simply void.” See, also, Dawson v. Lawrence, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Ohio%20546" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Ohio 546">13 Ohio, 546</a>.</p>

Smith, who was a married woman from 1852 up to the time this-suit was brought. The three special charges asked' by appellant’s counsel were sufficient to call the attention of the court to her rights as a married woman, and the court erred in not charg<a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>ing the jury fully upon that subject. There was no testimony showing any act upon her part inconsistent with her claim to her full interest in this property, and nothing authorizing the submission of a charge upon the subject of estoppel against her. The original Clark contract in 1855 had no reference to her; the services rendered under it had no reference to her; it is not claimed that she ever executed or authorized the execution of any conveyance on her part, or ever in any manner consented to-it, or for one moment waived her claim to her full interest in the property. As a married woman, she can not be estopped in pais, unless her acts were intentional and fraudulent. Steed v. Petty, 65 Texas, 496; Johnson v. Bryan, 62 Texas, 626; Bige. on Estop., 510.</p>

This disposes of all the questions which we deem it important to notice, except as to the 200 acres tract claimed and set out by metes and bounds, being the tract claimed by H. W. Powell and his vendee, Rogers. It appears from the testimony that this tract was settled upon by H. W. Powell on February 22, 1852, before the marriage of Francis A. Smith. That he first settled there as the tenant of one Prudhome, whose title he purchased, and that he has ever since held, used, occupied, and claimed it. Francis A. Harris was a minor when he first went upon the land, February 22, 1852; but when she married John R. Smith, in December, 1852, the statute of limitation began to run against her. She has long since been barred by limitation as against H. W. Powell and those claiming under him as to said 200 acres tract, and the judgment below is affirmed as to them.</p>
