Evans a tract of 60 acres; that Evans had paid a part of the purchase money and had erected improvements on this tract, of which he bad taken possession; that afterwards the sale of this land by plaintiff to Evans was rescinded in consideration of the refunding of the money paid by him and compensation for the improvements; that in February, 1873, plaintiff agreed with defendant that if he would furnish the funds for repayment to Evans, the plaintiff would give him the 55-acre tract in question; that defendant accepted said agreement, and that plaintiff, with means provided by the defendant, refunded the money to Evans and placed defendant in possession of the tract as his home, and promised to execute a deed to him, causing the land to be surveyed, fixing the bearing trees and the corners; that defendant, relying upon this gift or agreement, and with the consent of plaintiff, took possession of the tract about October 1, 1875, and has since continuously held open, notorious, and exclusive possession of the same, and placed improvements thereon (which he itemized) of the value of $3000.

W. M. Robinson has continuously since that date remained in open and notorious possession of the land, and has placed upon it improvements to the value of $800, in pursuance of the gift. W. C.

It will be observed that the finding does not, in terms, use the word “ exclusive.” For this reason it is urged in the second assignment of error that the finding is not responsive to the issue, and that the court therefore erred in rendering judgment against plaintiff in favor of W. M. Robinson. No statement of facts is found in the record. A motion for a new trial was filed, but was never, it seems, called to the attention of the court. The court evidently construed the finding to be responsive to the issue submitted, and we are not prepared to state that the interpretation was incorrect. We think that the finding already quoted indicates, <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>in substance, that the possession of Robinson was open, continuous, notorious, and exclusive.

The judgment awarded to the defendants, except-Walter M. Robinson, T2-3g- of the land in controversy. This was the community interest of the deceased wife, Catharine Robinson, and as Alfred K. Moore was not an heir of Catharine, he should have been excluded from the decree. We regard the failure to exclude him as a matter of mere clerical oversight, which will be here corrected and the judgment accordingly reformed.</p>

    <p id="b122-7" data-blocks='[["BL_122.7",122,[290,1174,1299,584]]]'>This land was claimed by the plaintiff to be his separate property. Defendants reply, that if such was the fact, certain improvements had been built upon it by money belonging to the community, and that they were entitled to be reimbursed for their mother’s share of the community applied to these improvements. It seems to be settled, that where a husband improves his separate property with the funds of the community estate, the wife, or her heirs, will be entitled to reimbursement out of his separate property to the extent of their share of the community; that their demand for such reimbursement is in the nature of a charge or an equitable lien upon the property so improved.

It is urged, however, that the issue was especially irrelevant, because the property was at the wife’s death, and still is, the homestead of W. C. Robinson, and that the latter, for this reason, could not be held responsible for the value of improvements, except, at most, according to such value as it might be ascertained when the homestead character should terminate. How far this question of improvements, in connection with this assignment, or with the tenth assignment to be considered, might be affected, if at all, by the fact that the property is impressed with the homestead character, we are not required here to consider. The pleadings nowhere raise-the question of homestead; and though both the verdict and the judgment declared the property to be the homestead, they, being without basis in the allegations, can not be held to affect any issue here presented.

The father had no interest in the community share of his deceased wife; her children did. The disclaimer by one of them, in the absence of special direction by him, would; we think, inure to the benefit of the remaining children of his mother.</p>

This will be corrected, and the judgment in this respect reformed.</p>
    <p id="b123-6" data-blocks='[["BL_123.5",123,[138,1035,1297,733]]]'>The tenth assignment of error is to the effect that the court erred in rendering judgment against W. C.

Robinson had expended out of the community funds $1030, in placing permanent and valuable improvements upon a tract of land of which he owned an undivided interest of and his wife an undivided interest of <em>ytü- </em>Husband and wife were thus, in the proportion named, tenants in common of the tract in question, and on her death her heirs succeeded to her tenancy.

As the head of the connubial partnership, he was authorized to use the community funds, with or without the consent of the wife. If, therefore, he used her funds in improving his property, the lien to the extent of such use exists in her favor against the property so improved, and the court was correct in so holding. Torrey v.

Mrs. Catharine Robinson was the owner of an interest of of the land improved. To that extent her property must be held to have been benefited from the money expended, and she should <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>be proportionately charged. Again, the plaintiff husband expended upon the improvements $515, his community share, from which the wife’s interest must be held to have received its proportionate benefit. To the extent of this benefit the husband should be credited. We could make the calculation and here reform the judgment, limiting the lien to the proper sum; but there are suggestions in the record that the behests of justice would probably be best subserved by remanding the cause on this issue of improvements and on the issue of partition raised by the pleadings, and the equities of the parties in connection therewith.</p>
