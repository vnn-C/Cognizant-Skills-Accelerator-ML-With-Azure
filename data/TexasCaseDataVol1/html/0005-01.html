Mandamus to Compel Action on Official Bond. — Appellee was elected county attorney and received his certificate of election. At the same term of the Commissioners Court at which they had canvassed the returns, he presented his bond and demanded that it then be acted on, and was informed that the court had fixed the 29th of November, 1890, as the day for passing on all official bonds. <em>Held, </em>that no statute being shown fixing the time within which the county attorney should qualify, and it not appearing that the commissioners were abusing their discretion in thus fixing the time, they could not be compelled by mandamus to act on the bond at an earlier date.</p>

On the Monday following the election the Commissioners Court met, canvassed the returns, estimated the results, and declared that appellee had been duty elected as county attorney. The county judge issued <em>to </em>him a proper certificate of his election. The court being still in session, appellee appeared before it with his bond and asked that it be approved. The court informed him that November 29 following had been fixed as the day when the court would assemble and consider bonds of all county officers, including his. He asked the members of the court if they had any objections to his sureties, and was informed that they had none. He then inquired if they objected to the form of the bond, to which they replied that “ they had not got to that yet.”</p>

The approval of the bond is required to be the act of the Commissioners Court. To act as a court, the commissioners must assemble from different parts of the county, at the place fixed by law for the holding of such court. They have many other duties to perform, and it is absolutely necessary that they be clothed with some discretion with regard to fixing the time for meeting and discharging them. So long as they are not shown to be abusing this discretion, by failing or refusing to do some act enjoined upon them by law, or by denying or withholding some right to which the law entitles a party, they should not be interfered with by mandamus.</p>

The delay in getting possession of his office, to which appellee was forced to submit, must be treated as incident to the right of the court to set, within reasonable limits, the time when it will meet and perform its functions, when such time is not fixed by law.</p>
