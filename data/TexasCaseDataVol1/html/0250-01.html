Probate Judgments — Collateral Attack. —The orders of a court having jurisdiction of an estate, made in 1871, directing a sale of certain property of the estate, and after sale confirming the same as reported, can not be attacked collaterally on the ground that there was no necessity for the sale, and no debts of the estate unpaid, nor because the order of confirmation was made at the same term of court at which the report was made, without a continuance thereof for one term, as required by law. The law then in force did not prescribe what the application for sale should contain, as it now does.</p>

Probate Sale — Purchaser’s Title. — Although by a previous report of the administrator there appeared to be a balance due the estate of $488.36, after the payment of all debts and expenses of administration, yet the application made for the sale of the land purported to be for the payment of expenses of administration, and a purchaser need not look beyond the application and decrees of court to ascertain whether or not the court had jurisdiction to order the sale, and such sale can not be collaterally attacked in a suit of trespass to try title.</p>

Same — Direct Proceeding to Vacate Deed. — Plaintiff alleged, that Lane was the attorney for the administrator; that an account filed in 1860 showed the estate to be fully administered and a balance of money on hand; that in 1867 an application was made to sell the land certificate to-pay expenses of administration, which on its face discouraged bidders by showing a want of knowledge of its actual ownership; that Lane, in whose handwriting were all the papers, in fact knew that the certificate was on file in the Land Office, and was cogni<a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>zant of all the facts with respect to the administration; and that no occasion existed for the sale of the certificate. He became the purchaser at a grossly inadequate price, hut did not record his deed until 1882. Unexplained, these allegations show fraud on the part of Lane and the administrator. The proceeding was a direct one to vacate the deed to Lane; and suit being against his heirs, general demurrer to the petition was erroneously sustained, although the orders in probate stand.</p>

Stale Demand. — Prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes, when the defense of stale demand was invoked it was usual to apply the longest period of limitation by analogy to the statute to determine when the demand would have become stale; but by the Revised Statutes the indefinite equitable defense of stale demand was eliminated from our law. and instead of meeting such a plea now with excuses it should be met with legal exceptions, as for example coverture, or infancy. Stale demand had not run against Mrs. Storer when the Revised Statutes took effect, and the plea is met by the fact that she has been a married woman since 1862.</p>

Property belonging to the estate may be sold for the payment of expenses of administration. If this was only an action of trespass to try title to recover the land sold in accordance with the application and orders in the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, we should hold that it was a collateral attack on the proceedings of the Probate Court of Harrison County, and that the court below did not err in sustaining the defendant’s demurrer.</p>
    <p id="b280-5" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[260,823,1296,289]]]'>But it is also sought to set aside the deed executed by Harris as administrator of the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, to Geo. W. Lane, the ancestor of the defendants, in pursuance of proceedings in said estate, which, if had as alleged, were fraudulent. While fraud is not alleged <em>eo nomine, </em>still facts are alleged which would constitute fraud; and such being the case, it is unnecessary to charge the fraud as a conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b280-6" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[255,1123,1300,681]]]'>Plaintiffs alleged, that Lane was the attorney for the administrator of the estate; that in 1860 an account had been filed showing that the estate had been fully administered, and that there was a balance in the hands of the administrator; that in 1867 an application was made to sell the certificate to pay expenses of administration, which on its face discouraged bidders for the certificate by showing a want of knowledge as to its actual existence or ownership; that in 1871 this application was renewed and the certificate sold, while Lane in fact knew that the certificate was on file in the General Land Office, and was cognizant of all the facts with respect to the administration, and that no necessity existed for the sale of the certificate; that he bought the certificate at administrator’s sale for a grossly inadequate price, procured a confirmation of the sale, had a deed executed to himself, and afterwards, in 1882, procured a patent for the land; and not until then did he record his deed.</p>
    <p id="b280-7" data-blocks='[["BL_280.6",280,[254,1818,1294,185]]]'>No other proceedings were had in the estate after the account filed in 1860, except to sell the land certificate; and the papers in connection therewith were alleged to be in the handwriting of Lane. The administrator died in 1873, since which time there had been no administration.</p>
    <p id="b280-8" data-blocks='[["BL_280.7",280,[251,2017,1297,327]]]'>Unexplained, these allegations would show fraud on the part of the administrator and Lane in the proceedings resulting in the sale of the certificate. In McCampbell v. Durst, 73 Texas, 420, it was held, in a similar case, that it was a direct proceeding to vacate the deeds, which included the deed of the administrator of Burst’s estate, and that it might be done if the facts alleged were true, although the orders in probate stood.</p>

Martin v. Robinson, 67 Texas, 369-381; Fisher v. Wood, 65 Texas, 204. As shown by the authorities cited, this does not violate the principle that the proceedings of a court of competent jurisdiction may not be collaterally attacked, for the proceedings leading to the sale and investing the purchaser of the land with the legal title may stand, and yet the holder of the legal title inajr be constituted a trustee for the benefit of the equitable owner.</p>

    <p id="b281-6" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[183,862,1295,285]]]'>The court below overruled the defendants’ exception setting up stale demand, and there is no cross-appeal; but if the judgment can be sustained on that ground we are not concluded from a consideration thereof, because the court below did not consider that it presented a defense, especially since under our practice this defense may be raised by a general demurrer, as seems to have been done in Smith v. Hampton, 13 Texas, 459.</p>
    <p id="b281-7" data-blocks='[["BL_281.6",281,[183,1159,1297,330]]]'>At the time of the proceedings in the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, which resulted in the sale of the land certificate, the plaintiff was, and continued to be up to the time of the institution of this suit, a married woman. She was married to her coplaintiff in 1862. Lane’s deed for the certificate was executed in December, 1871. It does not appear when the land was located, but it was patented in May, 1882, and the deed from the administrator to Lane was recorded in 1882.</p>
    <p id="b281-8" data-blocks='[["BL_281.7",281,[182,1507,1299,475]]]'>Prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes in 1879, there was no law fixing a period of limitation to an action of this character; and when the defense of stale demand was invoked it was usual to apply the longest period of limitation by analogy to the statute, to determine when the demand would become stale. If it should be granted that there are no circumstances shown in the petition as an excuse why the plea of stale demand should not be invoked, and that equity would not follow the law in excepting a married woman from the application of the principle, yet less than ten years had elapsed when the Revised Statutes were put in force.</p>
    <p id="b281-9" data-blocks='[["BL_281.8",281,[184,2001,1298,385]]]'>By the Revised Statutes the indefinite equitable defense of stale demand was eliminated from the body of our law, and instead of meeting such a plea now with excuses, it should be met with legal exceptions, as, for example, coverture or infancy. Article 3207 of the Revised Statutes is: “Every action other than for the recovery of real estate, for which no limitation is otherwise prescribed, shall be brought within four years next after the right to bring the same shall have accrued, and not afterward.” This article includes the plaintiffs’ cause of action.</p>
