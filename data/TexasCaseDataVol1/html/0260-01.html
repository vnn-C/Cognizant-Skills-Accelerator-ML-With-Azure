Defective Charge. — A charge which in substance informs the jury that if defendants were guilty of negligence in allowing the coupling which caused the injur)' to become defective, and appellant was injured while coupling the car, without negligence on his own part, that he might recover, is defective for not adding the further fact essential to a recovery, that the injury must have resulted from the defective condition of the coupling-.</p>

Extra Hazards — When a charge is given upon the subject of the liability of the master for negligent failure to inform the servant of the extra hazards arising from the use of a car of more than ordinarily dangerous construction. the jury must also be informed that the failure of the master to perform his duty in this respect must have proximately caused the injury; there is nothing in this case to warrant the court in assuming these facts to be established.</p>

Latent Defects. — The master would not be liable for injury caused by latent defects in the car, unless by the exercise of proper care he ought or could have known of those defects: therefore, the following charge was erroneous: ■‘If the defect in the car was latent, and not known to the plaintiff, and could not be known by the exercise of ordinary care, then the duty was on the master to acquaint him with the defect, if any exists.”</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b284-10" data-blocks='[["BL_284.8",284,[280,1290,1298,283]]]'>4. Same. — There was testimony that, after the accident, the spring of the ■drawhead was found defective, and some of the castings about it were broken, and this was the only evidence tending to show latent defects. If these defects •existed at the time appellee was hurt, and appellants knew or with proper care ought to have known of them, then their duty was to repair them, and their failure to inform appellee of these defects would neither increase nor diminish their liability.</p>

Special Charges Asked. — The third special charge asked by appellants embraced three distinct propositions, two of which had been sufficiently .given in the general charge. The third proposition was, “ That if the plaintiff knew that the drawhead was defective, or if the defects were open and visible, and he failed to notify defendants of the danger of the same, and without objection and protest continued in defendants’ service, he would be presumed to have assumed the risk incident to the defects.” If it had been embodied in a separate request, it would have been proper for the court to give it; but in asking charges parties ought not to so connect propositions contained in the general charge with others not given as to make it necessary for the court to unduly repeat the same instruction.</p>

Master Instructing Servant. — No question as to the duty of the master to instruct the servant as to his general duties was properly involved in this •case, and an instruction was properly refused which charged that appellee, in accepting employment, assumed to understand the service, and to be competent to discharge the duty of brakeman, unless the evidence shows that in the contract of employment defendant assumed to instruct him with reference to his duty and the dangers incident to the service.</p>

Rules of Company. — A rule of appellants provided: “ G-reat care must be used in coupling and uncoupling cars. Do not go between cars unless they <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>are moving at slow and safe rate of speed, nor attempt to make any coupling unless the drawbars and other coupling appliances are known to he in good order.” This charge was asked: “ If plaintiff did not use great care in making the coupling, or went between the cars when the same were not going at a safe rate of speed, or attempted to make the coupling when the drawbars or other coupling appliances were not known to plaintiff to he in good order, he can not recover.” The charge was properly refused. The duty of the appellants being to furnish cars with reasonably safe coupling appliances, in good order, appellee had the right to assume that this duty had been performed until he knew, or ought to have known, the contrary. It was not his duty to examine or inspect the attachments of the car, but the master’s, so far as its performance was involved in the care required of him. The latter part of the charge, which requires the servant to know that the coupling appliances are in good order before going between the cars, was not the law of the case.</p>

But if the servant knew of the defect in the machinery, or the defects were obvious and open to observation, in which case he would be presumed to know them, and yet remained in the service and continued to use the machinery without giving any notice thereof to the master, he would be deemed to have assumed the risks of all danger reasonably to be apprehended to such use, and is entitled to no recover}'.

But the imperfections which were claimed to exist other than those just mentioned were not latent defects.</p>
    <p id="b289-9" data-blocks='[["BL_289.8",289,[225,1732,1298,485]]]'>The third special charge asked by appellants embraced several distinct propositions: First, that it was plaintiff’s duty to have acquainted himself with the general dp ties of the position. Second, that he assumed at his peril the dangers and risk naturally and usually incident to his employment, including the dangers and risk of such defects as were reasonably open to his ordinary inspection under the circumstances. Third, that if he knew that the drawhead was defective, or if the defects were open and visible, and failed to notify defendants of the danger of same, and without objection and protest continued in defendants’ service, he would be presumed to have assumed the .risk incident to the defects.</p>

The effect of the third could be inferred, perhaps, from the language used in the general charge, and in another special instruction given at request of appellant. But the rule there laid down is nowhere pointedly given to the jury. If it had been embodied in a separate request it would have been proper for the court to give it. But <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>in asking special charges parties ought' not to so connect propositions contained in the general charge with others not given as to make it necessary for the court to unduly repeat the same instruction. •</p>

    <p id="b290-8" data-blocks='[["BL_290.7",290,[264,926,1297,283]]]'>The sixth and thirteenth special charges were both properly refused. The sixth was, that appellee in accepting emplo3rment assumed to understand the service, and to be competent to discharge the duty of brakeman, unless the evidence shows that in the contract of emphtyment defendant assumed to instruct him with reference to his duty and the dangers incident to the service.</p>
    <p id="b290-9" data-blocks='[["BL_290.8",290,[263,1222,1298,337]]]'>No question as to the duty of the master to instruct the servant as to his general" duties was properly involved in the case. It was claimed, however, b3r appellee, that the car by which he was hurt was of an unusual make and caused extra danger to him in coupling it, and the duty of appellants to warn him of the danger to result from the use of such car was in question. Such an instruction as that requested might easity have been misapplied by the jury as controlling this issue.</p>
    <p id="b290-10" data-blocks='[["BL_290.9",290,[260,1571,1299,237]]]'>The thirteenth requested instruction was based upon a rule of appellants, as follows: “ Great care must be used in coupling and uncoupling cars. Do not go between cars unless they are moving at a slow and safe speed, nor attempt to make any coupling unless the drawbars and other coupling appliances are known to be in good order.”</p>
    <p id="b290-11" data-blocks='[["BL_290.10",290,[260,1819,1297,280]]]'>The special charge requested the court to charge the jury, that if plaintiff did not use great care in making the coupling, or went between the cars when the same were not going at a safe rate of speed, or attempted to make the coupling when the drawbars or other coupling appliances were not known by plaintiff to be in good order, plaintiff could not recover.</p>
    <p id="b290-12" data-blocks='[["BL_290.11",290,[257,2120,1295,184]]]'>The court had charged in effect that appellee was bound to know the rules of appellants, and that if his injury resulted from his failure in this respect he could not recover, and that his inability to read would not exempt him from this duty.</p>
    <p id="b290-13" data-blocks='[["BL_290.12",290,[261,2316,1290,87]]]'>There was evidence that appellee could not read well, and did not know of the rule in question.</p>

Appellee had the right to assume that this duty had been discharged, and that the couplings of the car were in proper order, until he knew, or by the exercise of ordinary care ought to have known, the contrary. It ivas not his duty to examine or inspect the attachments of the car, but this duty the law devolved upon the master, so far as its performance was involved in the care required of him. The effect of the instruction requested, if not of the charge actually given, was to reverse the positions of the master and servant in this respect.</p>
