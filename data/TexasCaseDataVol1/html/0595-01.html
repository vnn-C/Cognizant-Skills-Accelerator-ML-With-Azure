Cleveland, then the owner of the land in controversy, executed to W. F. Sommerville a trust deed in the nature of a mortgage on said land, to-wit, a tract of 198 acres, situated in Johnson County, to secure George Halley and Alexander Gilroy in the payment of a certain promissory note for $1200, payable to their order in Fort Worth, Texas, with interest at 11 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually on the first days of March and September of each year, according to the terms of ten interest coupon notes thereto annexed; with the stipulation that if any one of said interest coupons should remain unpaid for five days after maturity, then, at the option of said Halley <em>&amp; </em>Gilroy, or the holder of said promissory note, the whole principal, with interest then accrued, should at once become due and payable, and that the holder might proceed to collect the same by sale under the deed of trust.</p>
    <p id="b620-7" data-blocks='[["BL_620.10",620,[301,1798,1301,583]]]'>It was further provided in the deed of trust, that in default of payment as aforesaid, said trustee was authorized, at the request of Halley <em>&amp; </em>Gilroy, or other holder of the note, at any time made after default, to sell the property in controversy at private sale, or to the highest bidder for cash in hand or on credit, at the court house door in Tarrant County, Texas, at public outcry, within lawful hours, after giving public notice of the time, place, and terms of said public sale and of the property to be sold, either by publication in a newspaper or by posting a notice on the court house door of said county for twenty days prior to the sale. In negotiating the loan secured by the deed of trust, Sommerville acted as the agent of Halley &amp; Gilroy, who resided beyond the seas. The deed of trust was promptly and duly recorded in Johnson County.</p>

Hudson, who, in July of the same year, conveyed it to B. F. Hudson for a recited consideration of $1000 cash and a purchase money note for $2500. <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>This note afterwards became the property of appellee, the First National Bank of Cleburne, upon which, in 1887, it brought suit against B. F. Hudson to foreclose the vendor’s lien on the land. Upon this judgment an order of sale was issued, and on the first Tuesday in June, 1887, was executed by a sale of the land to the said bank. No deed was introduced in evidence conveying the property in controversy to the bank, nor was there any proof of the payment of its bid of $100 at the sheriff’s sale; but the return on the order of sale showed that that sum was bid by the bank, and that the property was struck off to it at said sale as the highest and best bidder.</p>
    <p id="b621-5" data-blocks='[["BL_621.4",621,[166,839,1303,734]]]'>On the first day of June, in the year 1887, prior to the sale under the order of sale, said Sommerville, by virtue of said deed of trust, sold the same property before the court house door of Tarrant County, within the hours prescribed by law, to the highest bidder for cash, after posting notices, as required in the deed of trust; at which sale appellant, E. E. Chase, became the purchaser at the sum of $1376, which was the amount of principal, interest, and costs due from said Cleveland. Of this sum only $133 was then paid in cash. There seems to have been an understanding between said Sommerville and Chase, as we infer from the evidence, though not admitted by them, that Sommerville, who was still the agent for Halley &amp; Gilroy in loaning and collecting money for them, as such agent, would lend to Chase the balance of said bid, to be secured by a mortgage on the property, which was soon thereafter accomplished, a deed in pursuance of the sale under said trust deed having been duly executed to Chase upon his paying the $133 cash.</p>
    <p id="b621-6" data-blocks='[["BL_621.5",621,[167,1584,1299,584]]]'>The sale under the deed of trust was not advertised and made until more than five days after the maturity and default in the payment of the interest coupon due March 1, 1887, which remained unpaid at the time of the sale. Prior to any steps taken on the part of Sommerville to sell under the deed of trust, his local agent in Johnson County, who had negotiated this loan, notified Cleveland and Hudson of the default, and that the land would be sold unless the interest was paid. Appellee had no knowledge or notice of the default or sale until afterward. Upon learning of the sale, appellee offered to pay to appellant the whole amount due upon the mortgage, including all sums paid out by appellant, and offered on the trial to do the same, which offers appellant declined. The property was shown to be worth from $2500 to $3000.</p>

We are of opinion that no such declaration was essential to the exercise of such power. Leonard v.

This charge is also complained of, and we are of opinion that it contains error. Our view is,, that where a trust deed authorizes a sale for cash, and the trustee, who is also the mortgagee or the agent of the mortgagee, purporting to sell for cash, gives credit, or has an under<a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>standing with the bidder that credit will be given him on part of his bid, in order to induce him to make the property bring the full amount of the debt secured, this is not to the injury of the mortgagor or those claiming under him, and will not avoid the sale.

No other alleged irregularities were or should have been submitted to the jury; and our conclusion is, that those submitted, if irregularities at all, were not such as appellee could justly complain of.
