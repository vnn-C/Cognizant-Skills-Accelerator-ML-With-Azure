Conspiracy to Acquire Title — Case in Judgment. — Appellees had the superior title to the land sued for, but one deed in their chain of title, from the heirs of Walker to Garwood, was first recorded in 1870, destroyed by fire in 1873, and rerecorded in 1890. Appellants’ title was, deed from Steinle as attorney for the Walker heirs to Cremer in 1889, Cremer to Thulemeyer in 1890, Thulemeyer to Berry. Steinle and Thulemeyer were both land agents, with notice of appellees’ title, and in the pleadings were charged with a^conspiracy to deprive appellees of the land and to acquire it themselves; and it was claimed that Cremer was not an innocent purchaser, because he had bought on a credit and only paid $150 of the consideration, and gave his notes for $1990, which were afterward assumed by Thulemeyer, to whom he made a deed. Thulemeyer first tried to sell as agent of Cremer, and afterward as owner, and thereafter Steinle wrote to Berry that the land had reverted to him. Under these facts judgment for <em>the </em>appellees was affirmed.</p>

    <p class="headnotes" id="b586-8" data-blocks='[["BL_586.7",586,[284,1245,1298,408]]]'>3. Conspiracy to Acquire Title — Intervening Innocent Purchaser. — The series of conveyances through which Steinle and Thulemeyer ultimately procured deeds to themselves is to be regarded as constituting a single transaction, characterized and vitiated by the general purpose which actuated them. No strength is added to their claim by the interposition of a third party, whether he knew of their purpose or not. 1-Iis purchase is to be regarded as made for them, and their knowledge affected the transaction to which he was a party. On the facts found, the rule that a purchaser without notice from a vendor with notice is protected, and a purchaser with notice from a vendor without notice is also protected, does not control.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b586-11" data-blocks='[["BL_586.10",586,[279,1862,1299,586]]]'>Steinle and Thulemeyer are both land agents. Thulemeyer first tried to sell to Berry as agent of Cremer, afterward as owner, and later still Steinle wrote to Berry that the land had reverted to him. Cremer was 20 years old when he purchased the land, and lived in Austin. The twenty-first conclusion of fact by the trial judge was, that Thulemeyer and Steinle acted together in'a plan to put Cremer between them and the true owner, in the attitude of an innocent purchaser, technically. Whether he was knowingly a party to the plan or not I can not say, but incline to the view that he was. Soon after Cremer obtained his majority, Thulemeyer, with a full knowledge of all the facts, and as a part of a preconcerted scheme to unlawfully acquire the land, took a conveyance from Cremer, and assumed his notes.</p>

It was shown, and the court found, that Cremer conveyed the land to ThuFemeyer for $300 cash and the assumption by the latter of the notes given by the former to Steinle, and that the land had since reverted to Steinle. There was other evidence upon which the court based its conclusion, and the question made by appellees is whether or not this finding was warranted by the proof.</p>
    <p id="b588-12" data-blocks='[["BL_588.11",588,[273,1735,1298,179]]]'>We have fully considered the evidence contained in the record, and have come to the conclusion that the finding in this particular is sustained.

The series of conveyances through which Steinle and Thulemeyer ultimately procured deeds to themselves is to be regarded as constituting a single transaction, characterized and vitiated by the general purpose which actuated them. The interposition of a third person, as one of their instruments, can not add any strength to their claim, whether he knew of their purpose or not.
