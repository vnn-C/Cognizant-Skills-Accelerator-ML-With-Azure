Appellant had the necessary cars in compliance with his contract, but no engine at said station to handle the same, and appellee was compelled to put his cattle in the pens of appellant, which were very muddy, where they remained until about 2 or 3 o’clock of the morning of the 9tli. For the damages thus received appellee instituted this suit and recovered judgment for the sum of $1040.</p>
    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[277,833,1301,587]]]'>On the trial of the case in the court below, appellee was permitted to ask several of his witnesses, “ How much, in their opinion, the cattle were damaged per head by reason of the fact that they remained in the muddy pens of the company thirteen hours on a cold, damp day and night, and did without food or something to eat from early Friday morning until about 9 or 10 o’clock Saturday night?” to which the defendant objected, for the reason that the opinion of the witness as called for respecting the damage per head was improper and misleading, and the testimony of the witnesses should have been confined to facts, leaving the jury to determine the amount of damage per head. The witnesses, in answer to this question, stated from the best of their knowledge it would be from $3 to $4 per head.</p>
    <p id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[277,1431,1299,881]]]'>We think the action of the court in admitting this evidence was error, for which the judgment.will have to be reversed. In this case these witnesses should have been allowed to state- the effect the treatment mentioned in the question would have had upon the cattle, in reducing their weight and in affecting their saleable value in the several items alleged in the plaintiff’s petition, leaving the jury to estimate the amount-of damage resulting from these causes. From the general answer of these witnesses, giving the gross amount of damage per head, we are unable to state that in arriving at this amount they confined themselves to the legitimate items of damage to be taken into consideration in making the estimate. As to what is the effect of a given kind of treatment upon an animal, either in reducing or increasing its weight, or in injuring or benefiting its appearance, is a proper matter of opinion to be stated by a witness to the jury; but as to whether these several items constitute the legal damage in a given case, and the amount of such damage, the jury must decide under proper instructions from the court.

We are unable to say from the report of that case whether there was any proper plea of a want of consideration for such written contract or not, but suppose such plea was filed, as no question was raised thereon.

It might be, however, that the expression that notice should be given “ to its station master at said last named station” refers to Purcell as such station. If this be'a correct interpretation of the contract, we are of opinion that the court, in view of the allegation in appellant's answer that its agent at Purcell was known to ap&gt;p&gt;ellee, and was easily accessible, should have given this charge. The jury, however, in passing upon the reasonableness of such requirement, would be authorized to take into consideration the length of time the cattle were stopped at Purcell, and the facilities afforded appellee for giving this notice, and all of the attendant circumstances. If appellant relied upon this clause in its contract as being reasonable, it would be its duty to afford reasonable time, opportunity, and other facilities for compflying therewith; and as to whether this was done in the particular instance would be a question for the jury to decide.
