Possession, when Adverse. — In 1871 E, purchased from appellant 1 acre of land out of an 8 acres tract owned by him, out of the southwest corner, 157 by 281 feet in size, and B. purchased of appellant 1 acre in the northwest corner of said 8 acres tract, 157 by 281 feet. In 1875, by virtue of these titles, the then owners had enclosed their respective lots; in one of them there was an area of 170% by 308 feet, and in the other 1G9)£ by 308 feet. They sold to the vendor of one of the appellees, and the ancestor of the other. These sales were made with reference to the enclosures, but by the same description as in the original deeds. These vendors and the appellees believed that they were buying all the land within the enclosures; they recognized no adverse right, and supposed that they owned all the land enclosed. Suit was brought by appellant in January, 1890, for the unsold strip of land thus appropriated. <em>Held, </em>appellees’ possession must be deemed adverse, and their titles good by limitation, although after the excess was first discovered, by a survey made in 1888, appellees made a proposition to appellant to purchase it.</p>

Possession, when not Adverse. — The case differs from those where one extends his fence upon the land of an adjoining owner, intending only to assert title to the true line when ascertained. In such cases the possession recognizes the title of his neighbor to the land defined by the true boundary, when it is ascertained, and hence his enclosure of a part of the land that does not belong to him is not hostile.</p>

Same. — If the claim of ownership is not up to the partition fence, but only to the true line, there would heno adverse holding except to the true dividing line. But where the fence is believed to be the true line, and claim of ownership is up to it as located on the ground, even though the line as established by the fence is erroneous, the possession does not originate in admitted possibility of mistake, and the possession is adverse.</p>

The latter pleaded title by limitation of ten years, and on the trial the court decided in their favor on that plea. Appellant has brought the case here on appeal; and the sole question presented is whether or not such holding of the court below was correct.</p>

    <p id="b267-8" data-blocks='[["BL_267.7",267,[131,1692,1297,523]]]'>The evidence introduced by appellees was, that the land was enclosed, as shown above, at the date of the deeds from Yarbrough and Wimberley to Swann and from Burress to Mrs. House, respectively; that they bought with reference to the enclosures, supposing their deeds passed title to the area within the fences; and that they had held open, notorious, and visible possession ever since, claiming to the fences as their boundaries, and recognizing no other claim to the land embraced therein. In view of the findings of the court below, we must conclude that these are the true facts, notwithstanding some conflict in the evidence as to the time when the fences "were placed as they now stand.

He was not appellant’s agent with reference to the land in controversy, and did not recognize his title to it. In the summer of 1889, while the parties were negotiating for a settlement, appellant asked appellees if they intended to try to take his property from him by limitation, and Swann replied that he could not afford to plead the statute against appellant. House made no reply. The letter was written, and these conversations took place, in the effort to settle their differences, and in connection with the offer by appellees to purchase the land they had enclosed and that adjoining it.</p>

The case differs from those where one extends his fence upon the land of an adjoining owner, intending only to assert a claim to the true line when ascertained. In such cases the possessor recognizes the title of his neighbor to the land defined by the true boundary, when that is ascertained, and hence his enclosure of a part of the land that does not belong to him is not hostile.

The fact that they supposed they owned all the land enclosed does not render their claim any the less hostile, but rather strengthens it. The authorities cited all recognize the distinction. Alexander v. Wheeler, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Ala.%20340" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="69 Ala. 340">69 Ala., 340</a>. In the case last cited the rule is thus stated: “ If a partition fence be extended by one of two adjacent owners, so as to embrace within his enclosure a portion of his neighbor’s land, through mere inadvertence or ignorance of the location of the real line, or for the purpose of convenience, and with no intention to claim such extended area, but intending to claim adversely only to the real or true boundary line, wherever it may be, such possession would not be adverse or hostile to the true owner. <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>There can be no adverse possession without a coincident intention to claim title. If the claim, in other words, is not up to the partition fence as extended, but only to the true line, there would be no adverse holding of the new enclosure, but only up to the true dividing line. But the rule is different where the fence is believed to be the true line, and the claim of ownership is up to the fence as located, even though the established division line is erroneous and the claim of title was the result of the mistake. In such case there is a clear intention to claim to the fence as the true line, and the possession does not originate in admitted possibility of mistake.” The Texas cases cited by appellant do not conflict with this.
