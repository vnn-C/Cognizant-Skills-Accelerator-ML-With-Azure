Since the passage of the act of Congress authorizing suits against receivers without leave of the court in which the receivership may be pending, it has not been necessary to obtain such leave. The cause of action in this case is an <em>act or transaction </em>of the receivers which comes within the act of Congress.</p>

Power of Court Under Act of Congress. — The rule of law, that a receiver of property appointed by one court can not be sued in another with respect to that property without the consent of the court appointing him, has been changed both by the act of Congress and the State law; but both of these acts protect the courts having jurisdiction of the original cause in which the receivership is being conducted, in the due administration thereof, and enable them, in the exercise of their general equity powers, to prevent, by injunction against parties, any interference with or diversion of the property in the hands of the receiver.</p>

Derailment of Passenger Car. — In this State, the happening of an accident to a passenger does not make a prima facie case of negligence, but the derailment of a passenger car is evidence of negligence in the company, in the <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>absence of explanation showing that the accident happened without the fault of the railway company'; and instructions asking a finding for the defendant upon a state of facts which ignore the accident would have been on the weight of evidence, and were properly refused.</p>

Carrier of Passengers — Erroneous Charge. — The following charge held to impose too great care upon the carrier of passengers: “Defendants, as carriers of passengers, operating a railroad, are held under the law to the greatest possible care and diligence for the safety of the passengers they undertake to transport. They are not insurers of the absolute safety of their passengers, but are required to provide for their safety as far as human care and foresight will go.”</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b565-6" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[167,783,1299,239]]]'>6. Elements of Damage. — A diminished capacity to earn money is a proper element of damage, although the amount the injured person could earn before the injury, and the amount she did earn after it, was not shown. Her diminished capacity to do the work she was accustomed to do about the hotel was shown, and the charge should have submitted that question to the jury, rather than her diminished capacity to earn money.</p>

Since the passage of the act of Congress authorizing suits against a receiver without leave of the court in which the receivership may be pending, it has not been necessary to obtain such leave. The cause of action in this case is an <em>act or transaction </em>of the receivers which comes within the act of Congress. Brown v. Gay, 76 Texas, 444. There is no attempt by the act of Congress to confer jurisdiction upon the courts of any State which they did not have before. By a comity between courts, it is a well settled rule of law that a receiver of property appointed by one court can not be sued in another with respect to that property without the consent of the court appointing him. Such a suit would be in contempt of the court whose officer the receiver was, punishable by that court; and if brought to the attention of the court in which it is instituted by a proper plea, the right to maintain it <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>would be refused. The act of Congress, as well as our State law, authorizing suits against receivers without the consent of the courts by which they were appointed, changes the rule; but both these acts protect the courts having jurisdiction of the original cause in which the receivership is being conducted in the due administration thereof; and the provision of the Federal statute that “ such suit shall be subject to the general equity jurisdiction of the court in which such receiver or manager was appointed, so far as the same shall be necessary to the ends of justice,” is probably no greater reservation of power than courts appointing receivers would have generally, to be exercised by injunction against the parties, not the courts, to prevent interference with or a diversion of the property in the hands of the receiver.</p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[172,924,1300,489]]]'>Green Sanders, a witness for the plaintiff, was permitted to testify, over the objection of the defendant, that he" had visited the scene of the wreck where Mrs. Withers was injured, and saw some old timbers lying around the place of the wreck and some new work done there; that old ties had been taken out and new ones put in, or the ties that were there before had been reset; the work was new or recent at that place, and the ties that were there had no marks on them made by a wheel running off the rail on to the ties. This testimony does not come within the rule as announced in Railway v. Johnston, 78 Texas, 536, and Railway v. McGowan, 73 Texas, 355.</p>

It was also admissible for the purpose of showing the actual condition of the track, but not for the purpose of showing an admission by the defendants that the track was defective. It was, however, error to permit the witness to testify as to other wrecks. Railway v. Mitchell, 75 Texas, 81.</p>
    <p id="b567-7" data-blocks='[["BL_567.6",567,[174,1773,1298,137]]]'>The eighth, ninth, and tenth assignments of error are to the refusal of the court to give the first, second, and third special instructions requested by the defendants, which are as follows:</p>

Railway v. Smith, 74 Texas, 276. The first and second instructions as above requested ask for a finding for the defendants on a state of facts which ignores the accident. Such a charge would be upon the weight of evidence. All of the facts should be submitted to the jury, and they should find whether or not there was negligence. The third instruction requested is correct, with a further explanation to the jury as to what prudence and care reasonably cautious persons would have exercised under the circumstances, which, as laid down in Railway v. Halloren, 53 Texas, 53, is, “ that high degree of care and skill which very cautious persons generally, in their line of business, are accustomed to use under similar circumstances, to prevent danger.”</blockquote>

And their duty extends to the providing of good and sufficient material, the employment of skilled engineers, correct methods in the original construction, inspection, and subsequent maintenance in repair of its road, embankments, culverts, road bed, ties, and of the engines and cars which it uses, and the speed of its trains in the transportation of its pas<a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>sengers; and a failure of duty in any of these respects renders the defendants liable.”</p>
