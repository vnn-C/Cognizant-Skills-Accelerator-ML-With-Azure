    <p id="b706-6" data-blocks='[["BL_706.6",706,[267,619,1299,634]]]'>It is evident, from the two provisions of the contract last quoted, that the stock, in order to reach their final destination, would have to pass over roads other than those owned or controlled by appellee. If such was not the case, why these provisions of the contract that in effect so provide ? If the stock was to be carried through on the line of road owned or controlled by appellee, then these provisions of the contract are out of place, and express a fact that is not true, and provide for a contingency that in no possible event could in the nature of things occur. We can not assume that the parties to this contract intended that these provisions should not be given a meaning as well as other parts of the contract; and it is our duty in construing the contract to view it as a whole and give it such meaning as will best effectuate the intention of the parties to the instrument.</p>
    <p id="b706-7" data-blocks='[["BL_706.7",706,[265,1266,1298,533]]]'>That provision of the contract stating that Junction City, Kansas, is the end of the line of road operated by appellee is evidently inconsistent with those provisions of the contract stating that the stock must go over other lines of road in order to reach their destination — that is, Junction City. This inconsistency does not produce such an uncertainty as would render the contract void, but we think effect can be given to all of its provisions, and it can be explained upon the hypothesis that Junction City was simply named in the contract of through shipment as the place of final destination of the stock, and that appellee should not be responsible for damages resulting beyond the terminus of its own line, which is shown by the evidence to be San Antonio, Texas.</p>
