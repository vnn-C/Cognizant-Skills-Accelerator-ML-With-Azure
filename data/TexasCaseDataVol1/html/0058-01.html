Amendment not a New Cause of Action. — When a receiver sues all the stockholders of an insolvent corporation to recover of them the par value of stock purchased by them below par, for the benefit of creditors of the corporation, and alleges that he sues as receiver by virtue of the order of the court, sets up the total amount of the debts established against the corporation and the insolvency of the corporation, and the total amount to be realized in order to liquidate the debts, an amendment enlarging these allegations and setting up the date and amount of each debt which has been established against the corporation, with the name of each creditor, is not a new cause of action.</p>

Venue in Suit by Receiver Against Stockholders. — Suit being instituted in Victoria County against the stockholders living there and those living elsewhere, if the others not living in that county were necessary parties to the suit they were properly sued there. In its general structure and purpose, this is an equitable proceeding in behalf of all the creditors of an insolvent corporation (after the appropriation of all of its tangible assets to the debts) against subscribers to its capital stock, to have an accounting and a contribution from the defendants of such proportion of their unpaid subscriptions as may be found necessary to satisfy the debts. It is essential to the completeness of the remedy that the amount of the indebtedness of the corporation, the amount due by each stockholder, and the proportion thereof necessary to discharge the debts, should be ascertained. Therefore, the other stockholders were necessary parties, and the venue was properly laid in Victoria County.</p>

Solvency of Stockholders a Necessary Issue. — It is also necessary to ascertain who among the subscribers are solvent and who are insolvent, that the solvent ones may be required, as far as their subscriptions suffice, to contribute enough to make up the deficiencies arising from the insolvency of the others.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b82-13" data-blocks='[["BL_82.14",82,[282,2305,1294,202]]]'>4. All Stockholders Necessary Parties. — In order to render certain and uniform justice to each creditor and each stockholder, they should all, as far as practicable, be brought into court. The suit should be for the benefit of all the creditors, and against all solvent delinquent subscribers who are within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>

      <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>5. Same — One Sait Against all, Proper. — It should be within the power of creditors of an insolvent corporation, or their representatives pursuing the trust fund, to bring all parties necessary to a full adjustment of their rights before the same court in one suit. The principles and practice of equity afford such a remedy, which in nowise conflicts with our statutes, but is embraced within the scope of the fourth exception of article 1198, Revised Statutes.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b83-5" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[156,574,1295,240]]]'>6. Joinder of Parties. — The right of a creditor to sue an individual stockholder to recover an unpaid subscription and apply it upon his debt does not involve an accounting and marshalling of assets and distribution of all the proceeds. The authorities are in conflict as to his right to do so, but none of them deny the right of all the creditors to join all solvent delinquent stockholders within the jurisdiction of the court in one proceeding.</p>

Misjoinder of Parties and Causes of Action — A suit by a receiver in behalf of all the creditors of an insolvent corporation, against all delinquent stockholders upon their contracts of subscription, setting up the amount of unpaid indebtedness and the amount due on each stock subscription, and praying for judgment against each defendant for such an amount as may be necessary to pay off the indebtedness of the insolvent corporation, is not a misjoinder of parties or causes of action, although the subscriptions to stock were made at different times and places, and the conditions attached to the subscriptions were not the same, and although the defenses urged by the various stockholders were different.</p>

Receiver May Sue in His Own Name. — The corporation was es-topped by the agreement sued on from bringing this suit, and the order of the court and the law (Revised Statutes, article 1468) both authorizing suits by the receiver, he might sue in his own name, although neither the statute nor the order of court in express terms so directed. The law now in force expressly authorizes the receiver to sue in his own name. Sayles’ Civil Statutes, article 1464.</p>

Stock Issued in "Excess of Price Paid not Void. — Some of the defendants by their contracts were to receive $2 in stock for $1 paid, and others were to receive $85 of stock for every $60 paid. Article 12, section 6, of the Constitution, did not render the stock issued in excess of the price to be paid void. The first clause of this provision prohibits the issuance of stock unless it has been paid for; the second renders void all fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness. No fictitious increase of stock is alleged, but that the original stock was sold for less than parto defendants in violation of the rights of creditors. Stock issued and sold for a valid consideration is not fictitious within the provision quoted, nor void because sold for less than its par value.</p>

Stockholders Liable to Creditors for Par Value. — Article 12. section 6, of the Constitution, does not change the rule long established by courts of equity, that stockholders of a corporation are liable to creditors for the par value of the capital stock subscribed for and held by them.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b83-10" data-blocks='[["BL_83.9",83,[161,2059,1296,241]]]'>11. Creditors’Claims — Sufficient Consideration. — It was not necessary for the plaintiff to set out the cause of action of the creditors against the corporation with the same particularity as would be required in an original suit by the creditor against the corporation to establish it. The claims had all been established by the court in the receivership proceedings, and allegation of that fact conclusively showed the liability of the corporation for them.</p>

Performance of Conditions. — Fort Worth stockholders subscribed to the stock upon the condition that the company should erect and operate as soon as possible, in or in the immediate vicinity of Fort Worth, a slaughter house of certain stated capacity. The petition alleged that the slaughter house was erected, equipped, and operated, and this was sufficient allegation of per<a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>formance of this condition. The fact that the company was compelled hy financial embarrassments to suspend business did not release stockholders from their obligation to creditors.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b84-5" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[280,445,1298,277]]]'>13. Same — Increase of Directors. — A further section provided, that immediately after the acceptance of the subscription by thé company the charter should be so amended as to provide for thirteen directors, of whom six should be elected from the Fort Worth stockholders. It was not necessary to amend the charter in order to increase the number of the directors. Revised Statutes, article 575. That was done, and the object of that provision of the contract attained.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b84-6" data-blocks='[["BL_84.5",84,[277,735,1299,444]]]'>14. Construction of Contract. — Section 3 of the contract of stock subscription made with the Fort Worth stockholders provides, that they should not be entitled to any issue of stock until they had responded to each call to the amount of their respective subscriptions, and that if they should fail to pay any installment all previous payments should be forfeited; provided, however, that when their certificates of stock were issued their rights, duties, obligations, and privileges should relate back to the time of the acceptance of the offer. This contract gave the subscribers no right of election to forfeit their payments and recede from the agreement, or to refuse to pay for the whole stock which they bound themselves to take; and they were bound for the stock they subscribed for, whether all of the remainder was ever taken or not.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b84-7" data-blocks='[["BL_84.6",84,[276,1188,1297,327]]]'>15. Same — Necessary Allegation and Proof. — The Fort Worth stockholders did not unconditionally agree to pay the amounts subscribed for stock at the prices specified, but that they would pay those amounts in case half the cost of building, etc., should be equal to the amount subscribed. If one-half of such cost should be less than the amount subscribed, then they agreed to pay only such part of the latter amount as would be equal to half the cost. Therefore, there should have been allegation and proof of the cost of building and equipping the slaughter house at Fort Worth.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b84-8" data-blocks='[["BL_84.7",84,[275,1520,1296,158]]]'>16. Exceptions to Petition and Answer. — When the same points are presented in the exceptions to the petition as are raised by the exceptions to the answer, if defendant’s exceptions to the petition are overruled the exceptions to the answer are properly sustained.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b84-9" data-blocks='[["BL_84.8",84,[272,1685,1298,244]]]'>17. Setoff to Suits for Stock Subscriptions. — Several of the defendants having pleaded in setoff debts which they alleged the corporation owed them for money advanced to it by them while operating its business, <em>held, </em>that plaintiff’s exceptions to this plea were properly sustained. This is not a suit by one creditor against an individual stockholder, but a suit in equity against all. There is a recognized distinction between the two classes of cases.</p>

Procurement of Subscription by Fraudulent Representations. — Fort Worth stockholders allege that they were induced to subscribe to the capital stock by representations of the company that it would furnish half the money necessary to purchase, locate, and equip the Fort Worth slaughter house, which statements were untrue, and made to deceive, and did deceive. <em>Held, </em>of no avail in this proceeding as a defense against creditors.</p>

Purchasers of Stock Below Par, Liability of. —Although the Fort Worth stockholders bought from the residue of the stock and paid all they agreed to pay, they purchased below par value, and thus appropriated a part of the capital stock which was the trust fund for the payment of creditors,' and it bound them to make good to the creditors the face value of the stock when it became necessary to pay debts.</p>

    <p class="headnotes" id="b85-5" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[147,491,1294,159]]]'>21. Limitation. — Plea of the statute of limitations was properly stricken out. No cause of action against the subscribers ever accrued to the creditors until they had exhausted their remedy against the corporation and had all of its property applied to their claims.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b85-6" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[148,656,1294,193]]]'>22. Hearsay Evidence. — The secretary of the Victoria house received from the secretary of the Fort Worth house a statement showing names of Fort Worth subscribers, amount subscribed, amount paid, number of certificates, number of shares, and value. This paper <em>held </em>to be hearsay, and erroneously admitted in evidence.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b85-7" data-blocks='[["BL_85.6",85,[149,860,1295,285]]]'>23. When Shareholders Become Liable. — It is not necessary that shares of stock should have been actually issued and delivered to any of the subscribers to create a liability. Their subscription fixes their liability. Therefore it was error for the court below to hold that the Fort Worth defendants could be treated as shareholders only from the time they made payment, and that they could be charged with the par value of their stock only when they had made payment on their subscriptions.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b85-8" data-blocks='[["BL_85.7",85,[150,1151,1295,200]]]'>24. Notice to Creditors of Sales Below Par.. —When creditors had notice when their debts were created of the arrangement between the corporation and the subscribers to its capital stock, by which they received it for less than par, they can not hold the subscribers for a greater sum than they agreed to pay.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b85-9" data-blocks='[["BL_85.8",85,[150,1358,1295,240]]]'>25. What is Notice. — Notice to individuals who are presidents of banks which subsequently became creditors of the insolvent corporation is not sufficient to charge the banks with notice, in the absence of evidence that they acted for the banks in extending the credit to the corporation at such time and under such circumstances as to authorize the inference that the knowledge formerly acquired was still present before their minds.</p>

Same. — Parties can not be required to store away in their minds all facts which they learn, so as to be able to call them up at any time in the future to affect other transactions than that in which the knowledge was acquired. Such information has not the characteristics of notice in law, unless the transaction affected thereby took place under such circumstances as would lead to the reasonable conclusion that the fact reported was still remembered.</p>

It is a material right, and the denial of it in this case works a hardship. For example, here are judgments against Ed. Power and William Albrecht for $400 each. They may be, and. we believe they are, not only erroneous but absolutely void for want of jurisdiction in the court over the subject matter. But the claims against these defendants'are so joined and complicated with the claims against seventy or eighty other defendants, and the record is so encumbered and swollen by the proceedings in regard to all the defendants, that neither of them could have the judgment against him revised by the Supreme Court without incurring an expense for the trans-script alone greater than the amount of the judgment against him.

      <em>Limitation. </em>Certain objections of limitation of two and four years are urged against said indebtedness ab initio, and also against the enforcement of said indebtedness in the present proceeding. Certainly all this indebtedness, having been fixed by decree of court as against the corporation, is res-adjudícala as to the shareholders. If any of said claims were barred when approved in original suit, and the corporation failed to make proper defense, it was said shareholders’ province to have done so in said original suit. But now these claims are safe from collateral attack. Cook on Stockh., 209; 2 Mora. on Corp., 886. Now as to the statute of limitation as against the enforcement of these valid demands upon this unpaid subscription fund: In the first place, we question whether the statute can be invoked by appellants, for the reason that this right to have capital stock paid up is a “ continuing subsisting trust and confidence to which the statute has no application.” Payne v.

The principles and practice of equity afford such a remedy, which in nowise conflicts with our statutes regulating venue, but is embraced within the scope of the fourth exception to article 1198. Authorities which maintain the right of a creditor to sue an individual stockholder to recover an unpaid subscription and apply it upon his debt do not conflict with the rule above laid down. In such suits an accounting and marshalling of assets and distribution of all the proceeds is not sought, but a single creditor seeks satisfaction for his debt out of the unpaid subscription of one stockholder.

Others admit the right of the creditor to maintain such an action, but none of them in America, so far as we have examined, deny the right of all the creditors to join all delinquent members of the corporation in one proceeding such as that now before us.

The statute in force at the time of his appointment and when this suit was brought expressly authorized receivers to sue (Revised Statutes, article 1468), and he showed in his petition that he had been ordered to sue by the court. It is true that neither statute nor order in terms directed the suit in his own name. But the suit was one which the corporation by the agreements sued on was estopped from bringing, and it is difficult to see any reason why its name should be used when the cause of action asserted never accrued to it. We. understand both the order and the statute to authorize suits in the name of the receiver. Some authorities hold that unless a receiver is expressly authorized to sue in his own name, he can not, though authorized to prosecute a cause of action belonging to the party whose assets he holds, use his own name as plaintiff, but must use that of him to whom the right originally belonged. Others hold differently, and we think they are sustained by the stronger reason. High on Rec., 209, et seq. The law now in force expressly authorizes suits by a receiver in his own name. Sayles’ Civ.

The ruling sustaining exceptions to the plea of the Fort Worth defendants, setting up that they bought the stock contracted for by them from the residue of stock left on hand, and paid all they agreed to pay, was not erroneous. By this written contract they plainly agreed to take so much of the capital stock of the corporation as the sum for which they bound themselves would pay for, at a rate below the par value of the shares they were to get. This was an appropriation to them, by agreement between them and the corporation, of portions of the capital stock, the trust fund out of which the creditors had the right to seek satisfaction; and while it conferred upon them the right to the stock, as between them and the company, it also bound them to make good to creditors the amount called for by the stock whenever that might become necessary to pay the debts. The form of the contract between them and the corporation is immaterial. Equity looks at its substance and effect upon the rights of creditors; and thus regarded, it was only a subscription by them to the stock at a price below its par value. This was illegal as against the creditors. whom the -law will not allow to be deprived of the fund which it holds sacred for their satisfaction, by any device or contrivance of the corporation and the subscribers.

It was not alleged that any by-law on the subject had been adopted, and for that reason the plea was defective. But a more direct and positive statutory provision than this must be shown to satisfy us of the legislative intent to authorize subscriptions to the capital stock of a corporation at less than its par value (as was this contract by its very terms) and a release of the subscribers from their liability to creditors. The charter fixed the capital stock, and the law gives it the effect that all of such stock should be paid up, if necessary to pay creditors. We can not see that, by the provisions quoted, the Legislature intended to authorize the by-laws of the corporation to change the effect of the charter, but only to regulate the disposition of the residue of stock in such manner as was consistent therewith. This disposes of the further contention of appellee that this statute put creditors upon such inquiry as would have affected them with notice of subscriptions to or sales of stock at a discount.</p>

The defendants’ plea of the statute of limitations can not avail them as a defense, and they were properly struck out on exceptions. No cause of action against the subscribers ever accrued to the creditors until they had exhausted their remedy against the corporation and had all of its property applied to their claims. The subscribers could not be called on to pay, and were not subject to suit, until it was established that the amount due from them was necessary to satisfy the indebtedness. The statutes of limitation were not applicable to the case.</p>
