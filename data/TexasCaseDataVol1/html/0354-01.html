I thought until recently that I made him a deed for the land at the time he purchased the same, but recently I have investigated the records, and am now of the opinion that I only then made him.a bond for title, from the fact that McCuistion did not make me a deed until 1867. Until I searched the records I had firmly believed that I had made a deed, and now I have no other reason for believing that the deed was not made than the fact that I failed to find it by such search.

Stell to the defendant in June, 1887, being made for the purpose of carrying out the original contract made by Stell with John D. Womack in 1864, inures to the benefit of plaintiffs as well as to the defendant, and perfects plaintiffs’ title to an undivided two-thirds interest in the land.” The conveyance was made <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>upon a pre-existing consideration for the purpose of vesting the legal title where Stell supposed it equitably belonged; and if, in fact, Stell had not before executed a deed to Womack for the land, then Dohoney, who took the conveyance with full notice of the rights of Womack, and was himself claiming under him, became the trustee by construction of the legal title for the benefit of himself and the plaintiffs. Soye v. McCallister, 18 Texas, 98. It was not necessary that the transaction should be such as to create a resulting trust, as contended by the appellant under his fourth assignment of error, in order to make the deed inure to the benefit of plaintiffs as well as Dohoney, because a conveyance may be made under such circumstance as would imply a constructive trust; and we think that the circumstances in this case are such as would make it inequitable for the defendant to hold the entire title against the just claim of the plaintiffs, of whose rights he had full notice outside of the recitals in the deed from Stell to him, because he knew that there were in fact other heirs besides Mrs. Pass, who conveyed to him only what interest she had in the land, and procured the deed by representing to Stell that he owned the title of the heirs.</p>

McCuistion for 65 acres of the 100 acres, and a similar deed from McCuistion to the appellant for the 65 acres. It was error to exclude the Wooldridge deed, because a deed for a given number of acres to be selected from a larger tract is not void for uncertainty. Nye v. Moody, 70 Texas, 434. We do not pass on the admissibility of the other two deeds, as not necessary to a disposition of the case, and the party to be affected by' them is not before the court. As this error will lead to a reversal of the case, it is proper to note that the owner of the remaining 35 acres of the 100 acres will probably be a necessary party to the suit.</p>

Womack, Jr., and of his sister Archie Womack, in trespass to try title and for partition, against appellant, E. L. Dohoney, to recover and partition 825-|- acres of land of the S. M. Fulton survey, in Lamar County. From a judgment in favor of plaintiffs below this appeal was taken. There was a trial without a jury, and the record contains conclusions of law and fact and a statement of facts. These we have carefully examined, and conclude that the evidence introduced warranted the conclusions of fact derived therefrom by the trial court; therefore they are adopted as our conclusions of fact. At the last Austin Term of our Supreme Court, by an opinion of the Commission of Appeals, adopted the 24tli of May, 1892, the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded for a'new trial; but a rehearing was granted. All the questions raised were decided against appellant except the one upon which the judgment was reversed, to-wit, that there was error in excluding from the evidence a deed from Archie Womack to J. W. Wooldridge, which contained the following description of the land conveyed:</p>
    <blockquote id="b385-10" data-blocks='[["BL_385.11",385,[192,1622,1298,238]]]'>“All my right, title, and interest in and to 100 acres of land, to be selected by him, the said John W. Wooldridge, out of any part of a certain tract or parcel of land belonging to me, containing 825 acres, lying in said county of Lamar, north from the city of Paris, on Red River, of the headright of one Fulton.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b385-11" data-blocks='[["BL_385.12",385,[195,1871,1295,86]]]'>The ground of exclusion was that the deed was void for uncertainty of description.</p>
    <p id="b385-12" data-blocks='[["BL_385.13",385,[193,1969,1298,337]]]'>We are clearly of opinion that, without overturning a long line of decisions, this deed, being a voluntary as distinguished from a compulsory conveyance, can not be held, from what appears on its face, to be void. Our conclusion therefore is, that the court erred in excluding it on this ground; but whether this error, under the pleadings and proof disclosed by the record, requires a reversal of the judgment, we have found difficulty in deciding.</p>

If, therefore, her deed had described by metes and bounds any specific portion of the 825 acres, it would have been voidable as against her cotenants, but valid and effectual, it seems, <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>to bind, by estoppel at least, her interest in such specific portion. McKey v. Welch, 22 Texas, 397, and cases cited; March v. Huyter, 50 Texas, 251, and cases cited. See also cases cited below from California and Massachusetts.</p>
    <p id="b386-5" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[270,524,1298,336]]]'>If appellant had offered the deed as a conveyance of any specific portion of the land in virtue of a selection made, as therein provided, by Wooldridge, or with a view of asserting the right of selection in the partition proceedings, its exclusion at the instance of the other cotenants would not have been material error, especially as there were no pleadings to justify its admission for such purposes. McKey v. Welch, 22 Texas, 397; Peak v. Brinson, 71 Texas, 310. .</p>
    <p id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[263,872,1303,1030]]]'>But on the theory that appellant or his vendors waived this alleged right of selection, it seems to us that the deed should have been admitted against those claiming under Archie Womack, as a conveyance of an undivided interest in the land. We think a proper construction of the instrument gives it the effect of a conveyance of an undivided interest of 100 acres in the share of Archie Womack in the 825 acres tract, with the privilege of selection — whether valid or not — superadded. We can not distinguish it in principle from the conveyance of an undivided half, third, or other fractional interest, coupled with the privilege of selecting it out of certain specified parts of the land. We are of opinion,that the courts of Massachusetts and California (and doubtless of other States), have announced the correct rule, which may be stated thus: When a deed conveys a certain number of acres, without describing the land conveyed, to be taken out of a larger tract described, the grantee becomes by his deed a tenant in common, having a fractional interest represented by a fraction whose denominator is a number equal to the number of acres in the larger tract described, and whose numerator is a number equal to the number of acres conveyed. The grantee acquires such fractional interest in every acre of the larger tract. Wallace v. Miller, <a href="/cal/52/0655-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="52 Cal. 655" data-case-ids="1937283" data-case-paths="/cal/52/0655-01">52 Cal., 655</a>; Lawrence v.
