    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[264,814,1300,982]]]'>2. The court erred in its conclusions of law in holding that section 26, article 16, of the State Constitution, was intended to allow exemplary damages for gross negligence against such persons only as were liable under the statute for actual damages. The question of exemplary damages as held by the court was, that as the statute gave no actual damages there could be no exemplary damages; but the above authorities show that the statute does allow a right of action for actual damages. In law there are two classes of persons — one natural, the other artificial. Whenever a statute uses the word person, it means, unless qualified, both natural and artificial. This is the interpretation given it by Mr. Lawson in his Rights, Remedies, and Practice (volume 3, section 1017), in' which he uses the following language: “ The action to be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent, and child, and to be brought in the name of the executor or administrator within twelve months after the death. Similar statutes exist, with some difference of detail, in most of the States. The statutes are remedial in their nature, and should be liberally construed. They include corporations causing the death as well as natural persons.” In 4 California, 304, the following language is used: “The word person, in its legal signification, is a generic term, and was intended to include artificial as well as natural persons.”</p>
    <p id="b480-8" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[263,1808,1314,534]]]'>In the Texas case of Bartee v. Railway, 36 Texas, 648, the following language is used: “ Our statute confers a right of action against persons committing a trespass, in whatever county the trespass is committed. But it is urged that a railway company is not a person within the meaning of this provision of the law. * * * A railway company is an artificial person, and for many purposes is regarded in the law as subject to the same responsibilities and liabilities as natural persons.” In Stewart v. Waterloo Turn Verein, 1 American Decisions, 114, a corporation • is defined to be “a person subject to a penalty within a statute prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors, and is liable for such a sale by its committee at a ball given by it.”</p>

Bitz, deceased, in his lifetime sued the city of Austin for damages for injuries received on account of a defective and improper street in said city, by the overturning of his wagon. Suit was instituted July, 1885. The case was, in the lifetime of Alfred B. Bitz, tried, and judgment had in his favor, the date of the judgment being March 20, 1886. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court upon a cost bond. Pending the appeal, Alfred B. Bitz, on July 17, 1886, died, and left a written will bequeathing all of his property, including this judgment, to his wife Anna Bitz, one of the appellants, and making her sole executrix. The will was duly probated, and Anna Bitz qualified as sole executrix. After the death of Alfred B. Bitz, the Supreme Court, on the 4th day of December, 1888, reversed the said judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. On the 11th of November, 1889, Anna Bitz, executrix of Alfred B. Bitz, deceased, in her right as executrix, and also in her right as surviving wife, and Helen Bitz, Budolf B. Bitz, Clara Hesse, and Mary Schmidt, as the sole and only children of said Alfred B. Bitz, deceased, made themselves parties to this suit-by an amended original petition, and sought to revive this suit; the said Clara Hesse, a married woman, being joined by Paul Hesse, her husband, and Mary Schmidt, also a married woman, being joined by her husband, Victor Schmidt; the said Helen Bitz being a minor and appearing <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>by Anna Ritz, her mother, as next friend, and a guardian ad litem being also asked to be appointed for her; the children of Alfred R.

For the corporation itself does no act that renders it liable, but its liability for actionable negligence rests upon the acts of commission or omission of its agents and public servants that are entrusted with its business affairs.</p>

The purpose of this constitutional provision was simply to create a remedy that did not exist at common law. The fact that exemplary damages are recoverable by force of this constitutional provision does not place the right upon a more certain basis or higher plain than exist in those cases in which such character of damages is recoverable at common law. In that class of cases in which it is permitted by common law to recover exemplary damages the remedy is as effective and certain as when the right is granted by the written law. Reasons upon which these decisions referred to are based will apply as well in case where the right to exemplary damages is dependent upon the written law as it does when the right flows from the common law; and in all such cases the decisions apply.</p>
