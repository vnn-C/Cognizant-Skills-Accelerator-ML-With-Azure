In his court this suit was instituted by appellants as plaintiffs against appellee as defendant. Judgment was rendered for appellee, from which appellants appealed to the County Court of Cooke County. Pending the appeal Holman was elected county judge of Cooke County. When the cause was called for trial in the County Court, Holman, the county judge, declined to take jurisdiction thereof. He held that he was disqualified to try the case, from the fact that he had tried it as justice of the peace, and for this reason transferred it to the District Court of Cooke County. A trial in the District Court resulted in a judgment for appellee, from which appellants appeal.</p>
