Robertson, executed a mortgage upon certain lands to his sureties on his bond as guardian, to secure them and to save harmless the ward. September, 1859, another guardian having been appointed, F. W. Robertson executed a power of attorney to such other guardian, empowering him to sell the lands mortgaged. October 24,1860, Love, the second guardian, obtained judgment against F. W. Robertson and his sureties upon his bond, and a decree foreclosing the mortgage. In 1862 Love, under his power of attorney, sold the land in controversy, which was included in the mortgage and decree of foreclosure. Subsequently the land was sold under the decree. In litigation between plaintiff, holding under the foreclosure, and defendants, holding under the deed by Love under the power of attorney, it was held that Love “ held united in himself as guardian all the right to sell which the power of attorney could give him, and also the privilege of having the land sold under the deed of foreclosure. Between these methods of converting the land into money he could choose, and by either he could convey a good title.” ' it follows that the purchaser under the foreclosure took nothing, the land having been sold under the power.</p>

Robertson’s power of attorney could give him, and also the privilege of having the land sold under the decree of foreclosure and in satisfaction of it. Between these two methods of converting the land into money he could choose; and by either he could convey a good title to a purchaser.”</p>

      <a id="p672" href="#p672" data-label="672" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*672</a>On the present appeal, it is contended, in behalf of appellant, that the former opinion should not control the decision of the case; (1) because the facts on this appeal are different from those appearing in the record of the former appeal; and (2) because the doctrine announced, as above stated, on that appeal, is unsound and ought not to be adheredito.</p>
    <p id="b696-5" data-blocks='[["BL_696.4",696,[266,618,1296,177]]]'>1. As to the first of these positions, it is claimed that the record in the former appeal did not clearly disclose the fact that the mortgage above referred to was given to secure the ward, F. F. Robertson, as well as the sureties on F. W. Robertson’s bond.</p>
    <p id="b696-6" data-blocks='[["BL_696.5",696,[260,817,1302,835]]]'>It is true that the mortgage was not copied in full in the record in that case, as it is in this; but the clause reserving the right to sell the land, and requiring the proceeds to be appropriated to the extinguishment of F. W. Robertson’s liability on his bond as guardian of F. F. Robertson, is copied in full in the statement of facts. The judgment and decree of the District Court of Washington County, rendered upon and foreclosing the mortgage in question, in favor of Love, as guardian and for the benefit of F. F. Robertson, his ward, as well as the judgment reviving the same in 1874, were copied in full in the transcript on the former appeal; and the original decree recites the fact that the mortgage was executed to secure F. W. Robertson’s indebtedness to his ward, F. F. Robertson. There is nothing in the opinion of the Supreme Court indicating that it was not understood, as clearly disclosed by the former record, that at the time of the sales to Burleson and Wheeler &amp; Owens, F. F. Robertson, under whom appellant claims, had a lien on the land, first secured by a mortgage, but at the time of said sales merged into a judgment.</p>
    <p id="b696-7" data-blocks='[["BL_696.6",696,[257,1664,1301,436]]]'>On the contrary, it is apparent that the court appreciated the fact that the mortgage, given only in substance in the former record (which omits to state that it was given to secure F. W. Robertson’s ward, as well as his sureties), was the identical mortgage that was foreclosed in behalf of the ward, by the judgment of the District Court of Washington County, because in the opinion it is so stated, and it is held that the judgment referred to cancelled F. W. Robertson’s right to sell the land, arising out of the reservation, which is copied in the former record as part of the mortgage referred to.</p>
    <p id="b696-8" data-blocks='[["BL_696.7",696,[257,2113,1297,136]]]'>On the questions ruled on, we do not think the record before the Supreme Court, which we have carefully examined, is essentially different from the one sent up on this appeal.</p>

It may be true that appellate tribunals may sometimes render decisions so obviously wrong as that other courts, of lower rank, will be justified in disregarding them upon other trials of the same cases. Such cases, however, are exceptional and of rare occurrence; and the present case does not belong to that class. We shall hold that the former opinion <a id="p673" href="#p673" data-label="673" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*673</a>announces the law of this case, and we think the court below correctly interpreted the same when it submitted but the one issue to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b697-5" data-blocks='[["BL_697.4",697,[162,435,1297,379]]]'>The record on the other appeal clearly disclosed the fact that the deeds from F. W.

Robertson; and in view of this fact, when the Supreme Court held that the validity of sales made by Love was dependent upon whether they were made before or after the death of his ward, we conclude that court did not refer to the execution of the deeds, but rather to the time when the contracts of sale were made.</p>
    <p id="b697-6" data-blocks='[["BL_697.5",697,[163,834,1297,635]]]'>The fifteenth assignment of error complains of the refusal of the court to charge the jury, at request of appellant, that the search made for the supposed bond for title to Wheeler &lt;fe Owens, as shown by the evidence, was not in law sufficient, and that they should disregard all the evidence relating to it. Appellant did not object to the introduction of the testimony tending to show the execution, loss, and contents of the bond in question because sufficient search had not been made for it; and not having made such objection, we do not think he had the right, after the evidence was closed, to raise substantially that objection by a special charge. If the objection had been made to the testimony, and sustained, appellees might have produced the legal representative of Judge Renick, in whose custody this bond was last seen, and proved that it could not be found among his papers.</p>

It merely charges that the court erred in adding a certain qualification to special charge No. 9 asked by appellant, without pointing out why such qualification was error. Was it because the testimony did not warrant the qualification, or was it because it was upon the weight of evidence ? A charge may be erroneous for several reasons, and an assignment of error challenging its correctness should assign a reason why it is alleged to be incorrect.</p>

It also appears that appellees’ counsel, in addressing the jury, stated that the perseverance of appellant’s counsel, their manner of conducting the case, and what had transpired during the trial in the hearing of the jury, showed them to be largely interested in the result of the suit; and stated that appellant showed a grasping spirit in the manner of interrogating witnesses in reference to improvements.</p>
