The sheriff’s deed to Morgan Wilson of the leasehold estate is dated the 11th of February, and Wilson’s deed to Moke is dated Feb<a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>ruary 12, 1890.

On same day Loustaunau <em>&amp; </em>Co. executed receipt to Moke for the $40 rent, as per lease, to 1st of March, 1890. These papers were all delivered to Moke on the same day at the same time. He applied to defendants’ attorney, Bergstrom, to rent the place, understanding that Barnard, Wilson’s attorney, held the lease, and that Loustaunau &amp; Co. were willing it should be rented on the transfer of the lease. Moke says he went to Bergstrom, and he fixed up the rent to suit himself.</p>

Barnard, for Wilson, recognized the liability of his client to a full compliance with the terms of the lease, as assignee thereof; and he assumed all the liabilities of Lambert, the original lessee, and Loustaunau &amp; Co. have accepted such liability.</p>

Appellants insist that the testimony was immaterial, irrelevant, and prejudicial to them, and1 did not tend to prove that the lease to Richard S. Lambert had been can-celled or abrograted, or show any agreement upon any consideration to release the landlord’s lien upon the goods.</p>
    <p id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[170,617,1296,275]]]'>One of the issues made by plaintiffs’ pleadings was, that Loustaunau &amp; Co. had by their conduct and acts inconsistent with the lease to Lambert cancelled the same; and another was, that they had in the end accepted Moke, the assignee of the original leasehold, as their lessee, by which they had cancelled the original lease and discharged the goods from their lien.</p>
    <p id="b465-6" data-blocks='[["BL_465.5",465,[170,913,1297,288]]]'>The testimony was admissible upon these issues. All the transactions and acts of Loustaunau &amp; Co. in connection with the rented premises leading to the final result of payment of the accruing rents to them, and accepting Moke as their responsible lessee, were admissible. Any circumstance that would tend to show their relations to the property, or to those to whom the lease had been assigned, was pertinent and relevant.</p>
    <p id="b465-7" data-blocks='[["BL_465.6",465,[169,1213,1299,584]]]'>When Wilson became the owner of the lease, he assumed all the obligations of the original lessee, as he was bound by law so to do; and upon the transfer of the lease to Moke, he in turn became so bound; and any fact tending to show that the landlords recognized such substitution was legitimate. Their acceptance of either of them as lessee, or as the party to whom they should look for payment of rent, such party being bound so to do in law or by contract, amounted to a waiver of lien upon the goods of the original tenant. The judgment in their favor would not interfere with their right to do so. Their lien could in this manner be discharged, even though it had been secured by judgment. Harvey v. McGrew, 44 Texas, 412; Howard v. Britton, 71 Texas, 287; Le Gierse v. Green, 61 Texas, 128; Giddings v. Felker, 70 Texas, 176.</p>
    <p id="b465-8" data-blocks='[["BL_465.7",465,[170,1809,1298,135]]]'>There was no error in submitting the case to the jury; the issues and the testimony required it, and the evidence supported the verdict. The assignment of error on this point is not well taken.</p>
    <p id="b465-9" data-blocks='[["BL_465.8",465,[169,1958,1316,383]]]'>There was evidence tending to establish the proposition that Loustau- . nau &amp; Co. had waived their lien upon the goods in the rented building upon consideration of other persons becoming bound to pay the rent; and there was testimony tending to show; and we find the fact, that the rent due under the original contract had been paid to Loustaunau <em>&amp; </em>Co. for their benefit, or that they were secured in the same up to the time of trial; and therefore the assignment of error objecting to the charge upon the subject can not be sustained.</p>

The facts did tend to show that Loustaunau <em>&amp; Co. </em>had abandoned their original lien and accepted other obligations, and had received rent in pursuance of the same.</p>
    <p id="b466-5" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[281,466,1298,88]]]'>The fifth assignment of error can not be sustained; it objects to the following charge of the court, given by request of plaintiffs:</p>

    <p id="b466-7" data-blocks='[["BL_466.6",466,[280,912,1299,438]]]'>The expression, “ or any part thereof,” should, possibly, not have been used in the charge, because the undisputed evidence shows that the entire unexpired term was assigned to Moke; which, as we have before seen, rendered him liable for the performance of all the undertakings of the original lessee, for rent past due and unpaid as well as that to become due, the acceptance of such obligations by the landlords in legal effect being an acquittance of Lambert and a release of the rental lien upon the goods on the rented premises. The expression noticed, under the facts, could probably mean no more than that part of the term unexpired.</p>

The obligation of Moke, who was similarly bound as assignee, got into the hands of Loustaunau &amp; Co., and they have collected the rent from Moke from the time of the assignment to him to the time of trial, Barnard says, as his agent; but the jury could construe the facts to mean that Loustaunau <em>&amp; </em>Co. were collecting the rent on their own account, especially with Barnard’s testimony before them, that if Loustaunau &amp; Co. did not recover in this suit, etc., but if they did recover, he (Barnard), for his client, Wilson, was to have the benefit of the judgment after deducting costs. He says they were his agents in collecting the rents, and they may have been, in the sense that they were to <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>apply the collections of rent to the payment of his obligation, to see that the rents were paid.
