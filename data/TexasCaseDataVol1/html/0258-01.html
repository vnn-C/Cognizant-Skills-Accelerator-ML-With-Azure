On the 6th day of January, 1892, the defendants perfected their appeal by filing a proper appeal bond. The appeal was returnable to the Tyler Term of the Supreme Court, which would have commenced, as the law then stood, on the first Monday in October, 1892; and the appellants would have had until the first day of the assignment, during said term, to which Anderson County belonged in which to file the transcript in the Supreme Court. The transcript was not filed in the Supreme Court and has not been filed in this court.</p>

To require the record to be filed within ninety days from the time when the appeal was perfected to the Supreme Court, would defeat the right of appeal, as that time had expired when the Courts of Civil Appeals were organized. We think that a reasonable construction of the law would be, that the appeal became perfected to this court on the day that the act establishing the Courts of Civil Appeals took effect, and that the appellants would have ninety days from that date, September 1, 1892, within which to file the transcript of the record in this court. As that time has not yet expired, the motion to affirm the judgment of the court below, on certificate, will be overruled.</p>
