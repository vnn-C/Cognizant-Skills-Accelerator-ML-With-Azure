The appeal bond is executed by Hinzie alone, and it is made payable to W. L. Moody <em>&amp; </em>Co. alone, so the heirs are not parties to the appeal. Hinzie has appealed in his own right alone.

We do not deem it necessary to examine appellant’s several assignments of error, raising this question, separately, because they all lead to the one question as to the exemption of the warehouse. Appellant contends that it is a mixed question of law and of fact which should have been submitted to the jury, and that it was error for the court in its charge to instruct the jury that the warehouse was not exempt. If the facts showed that the warehouse was not exempt as a part of the defendant’s business homestead, then it would be proper for the court to so charge the jury.</p>
    <p id="b54-5" data-blocks='[["BL_54.4",54,[263,819,1293,79]]]'>We find the facts with reference to the use of the warehouse to be as follows:</p>
    <p id="b54-6" data-blocks='[["BL_54.5",54,[255,918,1302,1329]]]'>On the 27th day of October, 1889, M. Hinzie was a merchant in the city of Palestine, and as such was a wholesale and retail dealer in groceries, hardware, and tinware, and his storehouse, which he kept open, and in which he exposed his goods for sale, and in which he kept his office and books, was situated on lot No. 10 in block No. 163 of said city. Across the street, and in another block, and on lot No. 20, in block No. 162, he had his warehouse, in which he kept his goods in unbroken packages, and stoves and heavy goods; also kept there tinners’ tools, etc., and heavy and bulky goods. This warehouse was kept closed, generally, and the key to it kept in the other building. Goods were not exposed for sale in it, but he sometimes sold goods from it. When a customer came into the other building and wanted goods not in it, but in the warehouse, he would then take the key to the warehouse, go over there and sell the needed article or articles, and then lock it and return the key to the other building. The goods were kept in bulk in the warehouse; no shelves, nor counters, nor office. Hinzie called this house his warehouse. In it was a room in which Mr. Lowenstein, who was a practical tinner in Hinzie’s employ, kept his tin and sheet-iron tools, and Lowenstein also slept in this building. Upon this lot Hinzie also had a privy and water closet, which was used by himself and employes. Lot 10 in block 162 was covered with a two-story brick building, and fronted on the main business street in the city, and the warehouse was a frame building and was purchased by him several years after he had begun business in the other building. On October 27, Hinzie made a deed of trust upon all of his goods situated in both of these buildings, and gave to the trustee exclusive possession of the goods and the house in which they were situated, except that Hinzie retained the possession of his office in the brick building.</p>

A warehouse on the same lot with the regular business house and attached to it as an enlargement thereof, has been held to be exempt. <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>Hargadene v. Whitfield, 71 Texas, 489. But in McDonald v. Campbell, 57 Texas, 614, a warehouse situated on a different lot from that in which the business was conducted, and not adjacent thereto, was held not to be exempt. The evidence shows that the use of the warehouse in connection with the defendant’s business was bona fide and valuable; and if the question was such an one as should have been submitted to the jury, there could have been no doubt but that the jury would have returned a verdict that the warehouse was a part of the defendant’s business homestead. We do not think, however, that such a business home is within the contemplation of the Constitution. The lots must be used for the purpose of a home, or as a place in which to exercise the calling or business of the family. Outlets may be used' for such purposes in connection with a home as would make them a part of the homestead; but the business home must be the place ■where the head of the family exercises his calling or business. It is his workshop, office, or other place where he habitually is in the following of his calling, and not every other lot or building which he may incidentally use in connection therewith. Once begin to exempt warehouses and storerooms as a part of the business homestead, and there would be <em>no </em>limit except the value at the time of their designation as prescribed in the Constitution.</p>
