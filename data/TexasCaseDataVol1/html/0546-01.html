Suit for Penalty for Refusal to Deliver Freight. — A St. Louis milling company shipped to appellee, at Brenham, a car load of flour, the bill of lading for which (issued by the St. Louis, Arkansas &amp; Texas Railway) showed that the rate of freight was 40 cents per 100 pounds, and that it was to be sent via the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway. The schedule rate on flour to Brenham via the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway was 40 cents per 100 pounds, and via Houston &amp; Texas Central Railway was 53 cents per 100 pounds. The flour came by the Houston <em>&amp; </em>Texas Central Railway, which refused to deliver it unless the 53 cents rate was paid. Held, the penalty provided by statute for a failure to deliver merchandise upon tender or payment of freight charges shown by the bill of lading, can not, in this case, be enforced against the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railway.</p>

Offer by Shipper to Pay Difference in Freight Charge. — Evidence offered by the appellant, that the milling company offered to hold appellee harmless, and to pay the difference between the 40 and 53 cents rate, was inadmissible. If the appellant was liable for the penalty, appellee could not be deprived of his right to recover it by the willingness of a third party to pay the difference. Had this difference been paid by the shipper, and then the goods tendered to the consignee upon payment of the remainder, it may be that from the time of such tender he would have been relieved from liability, but appellee was under no obligation to assist him in relieving himself from liability that he had or might thereafter incur.</p>

Conflict of Law — Act of Congress and State Statute. — The act of Congress requires that the schedule of rates be agreed upon and published, and denounces penalties upon any carrier who receives more or less than schedule rates. The State statute provides that any carrier who shall refuse to deliver freight upon tender or payment of the freight charges shown by the bill of lading, shall be liable for an amount equal to the freight charges for each day’s delay. This State law demands that the carrier should do a thing that is forbidden by a constitutional law of Congress, and that law is paramount to any State law when the provisions of the latter are antagonistic to those of the former.</p>

Notice of Contract to Ship at a Particular Rate. — It is immaterial whether the defendant company knew or did not know that the receiving carrier had contracted to transport the freight at 40 cents per 100 pounds. It was- required by statute to receive the cars of connecting roads, and under its contract with the connecting road was under obligation to carry its freight at an agreed rate, which rate could not be changed except by violating the Federal statute. Therefore it could not be said to have adopted and ratified the 40 cents bill of lading, even if it knew that that was the rate agreed on.</p>

To state this question, it seems to us, is to answer in the negative. A law of Congress, itself constitutional, is paramount to any State law, when the provisions of the latter are antagonistic to those of the former. We therefore conclude that it is immaterial whether the defendant company knew or did not know at the time it received the flour consigned to appellee that the St. Louis, Arkansas <em>&amp; </em>Texas Railway had contracted with appellee to transport his merchandise at the rate of 40 cents per 100 pounds. The defendant was required by the statute of this State to receive the cars of roads connecting with it, and under its contract with said connecting railway the defendant was under obligation to carry freight tendered by said line at an agreed rate, and that rate neither the defendant nor the company delivering the goods to defendant could change except by violating the Federal statute. Under such circumstances, we do not think the defendant company could be said to adopt and ratify the bill of lading, if it received the goods with knowledge that the railway company tendering them had contracted with appellee to transport said goods at 40 cents per 100 pounds. And unless the evidence shows that the carrier refusing to deliver goods to the consignee upon payment or tender of payment of the freight specified in the bill of lading, either executed the bill of lading or ratified it, no recovery can be had under the statute. Dwyer v. Railway, 75 Texas, 572. We think the trial court erred in the application of the law to the facts of the case, and that the law was substantially presented in instructions one and two requested by appellant’s counsel.</p>
