      <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>We find from the record that on said 26th day of July, 1884, said Donovan <em>&amp; </em>Wylie, who were then engaged in mercantile business in the town of Abilene, Texas, being in a failing condition and desirous of securing certain preferred creditors, at the instance of said J. W. Carter, who was one of said creditors, and at the instance of a surety for said Donovan &amp; Wyíie to said Fechheimer Bros. &amp; Co., also a firm of said creditors, made, executed, and delivered to said Henderson, with the knowledge and assent of said Carter and of said surety, but without the knowledge or consent of said Fechheimer Bros, and Co., or any of the other beneficiaries, a certain instrument in writing, by which said Donovan &amp; Wylie conveyed to said Henderson in trust their entire stock of goods then situated in Abilene, to secure and enforce the payment of the several debts then about to become due to the creditors therein named, including said J. W. Carter and Fechheimer Bros. &amp; Co.; and authorized said trustee to sell said property if said debts, or any part thereof, should not be paid at maturity, and apply the proceeds of such sale to the payment of said several debts in full, if sufficient for that purpose, and if not, then ratably; balance, if any, to be paid back to said Donovan &amp; Wylie. We find that contemporaneously with the execution of said instrument, termed a deed of trust, said Henderson was placed in the actual and exclusive possession of said entire stock of goods, and that thereafter said Northington, in the capacity of sheriff of Taylor County (which office he then held), on said 26th day of July, 1884, levied a writ of attachment, at the instance of the attorney for Sanger Bros., on a portion of said stock of goods, to-wit, a lot of clothing valued at $3211.60, which attachment was issued out of the County Court of Taylor County in favor of said Sanger Bros, against said Donovan &amp; Wylie, to collect a debt of $838.17, which said Donovan &amp; Wylie owed to said Sanger Bros.; that at the time of making this levy said sheriff demanded and obtained from said Henderson the keys to said store house and took actual possession of said entire stock of goods, and that the proof tended to show that said «attorney for Sanger Bros, was present at said store at the time; that said sheriff, continuing in the exclusive possession of said entire stock of goods, a few hours thereafter levied an attachment against said Donovan <em>&amp; </em>Wylie in favor of Middleton &amp; Daugherty on said entire stock of goods, subject to the prior levy for Sanger Bros.; and on the following day (July 27), while still in possession, levied an attachment writ upon said entire stock of goods, subject to prior levies, in favor of the Martin Brown Company against said Donovan <em>&amp; </em>Wylie, which attachment issued out of the District Court of Taylor County, to collect a debt of $3574.27 which said Donovan &amp; Wylie owed said Martin Brown Company; that the return on the first attachment levied stated that it was levied upon said clothing, attaching an inventory thereof, and the returns on the Other two attachments recited that they were made on the entire stock of <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>goods, subject to the prior levy of Sanger Bros, on the same property; that the stock of goods remained in the hands of said sheriff till his successor in office acquired the possession thereof; that thereafter the attachment liens were foreclosed, Sanger Bros.’ attachment upon the clothing as described in the return on that writ, and the other attachments, to-wit, the Martin Brown Company attachment and subsequent attachments, on the entire stock of goods subject to the prior levy of Sanger Bros., the Middleton <em>&amp; </em>Daugherty suit having been dismissed a few days after the attachment was levied: that under these judgments of foreclosure separate orders of sale were issued, but the entire stock of goods was advertised and sold by the proper officer of Taylor County under the order of sale issued in the Martin Brown Company suit, and the proceeds of such sale distributed among the different plaintiffs in said suits, Sanger Bros, being first paid; that appellants were paid by remittances tó their attorneys in Fort Worth. The record does not disclose at whose instance the sale and distribution of the proceeds were made, nor what knowledge, if any, Sanger Bros, and the Martin Brown Company had, in receiving their respective parts of the proceeds of said sale, of the manner in which the property had been sold and the proceeds distributed.</p>

He also alleged that appellants acted together in causing the seizure and conversion of the entire stock of goods, of the alleged value of $23,714.73, and, as measure of damages, set out the amount of his commissions and the debts due to said Carter and Fechheimer Bros. &amp; Co., respectively, and prayed to recover in his own behalf and in the capacity of trustee as well as for the use and benefit of said Carter and Fechheimer Bros. &amp; Co. His petition was specially excepted to for misjoinder of causes of action and nonjoinder of the beneficiaries in said deed of trust. The exceptions were all overruled and the points duly reserved ; but the court on the trial eliminated the issue of a recovery in his own behalf, and submitted his right to recover in the other capacity upon the theory that the recovery should be apportioned amongst the accepting beneficiaries in said deed of trust according to the amount of their respective debts, and that it should be limited to the amount of said debts, if less than the value of the goods converted. The court also charged the jury substantially as follows: If you find that ‘1 Sanger Bros, and the Martin Brown Company acted in concert and together, and so acting the <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>Martin Brown Company sued out, or caused to be sued out, the order of sale under which the goods were sold, it being understood and agreed between them at the time that they would participate in and together share the benefits of such sale, and after the sale did in fact share the benefits thereof, and that thereby the value of said goods was wholly lost to said trustee and accepting beneficiaries,” they would all be liable; of which charge appellants complain on the ground that there was no evidence to warrant it. On a former trial of the cause appellee, upon discovering a variance between the description of his deed of trust ^contained in his petition and the instrument itself when offered in evidence, was permitted to withdraw his announcement of ready for trial and have the cause withdrawn from the jury after two witnesses to the execution of the deed of trust had testified, of which complaint is also made, based upon a plea in bar of this action.</p>
    <p id="b440-5" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[265,1068,1296,291]]]'>It is earnestly contended by appellants that appellee can not maintain this suit without also joining with him the several beneficiaries named in said trust deed, and we have been cited to a great many authorities upon this question. In our opinion they are entirely inapplicable, being mostly cases where beneficiaries in deeds of trust are held to be necessary or proper parties, according to the well established rules of equity.</p>

It is true that the instrument under which Henderson took possession of said goods did not vest in him the legal title, but only created a lien upon the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries therein named; but it is also true that his possession under said instrument was in the nature of a pledge, and entitled him to maintain an action against a trespasser, though the title was not in him. See Jones on Pledges, sec. 10, 12, 434. Osborn v. Koenigheim, 57 Texas, 91, and subsequent cases.</p>

See Chadwick v. Meredith, 40 Texas, 383; Giddings <em>&amp; </em>Giddings v. Baker, 80 Texas, 312; Kauffman v. Wooters, 79 Texas, 210; Blum v. Strong, 71 Texas, 321; 73 Texas, 566. -</p>

We announce simply, that if appellee, on the orignal hearing in this court, had offered to remit and dismiss as to Sanger Bros., the judgment might have been affirmed as to the Martin Brown Company, if no error had been found to their prejudice in the record.</p>
