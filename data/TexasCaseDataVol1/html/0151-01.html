The creditor, upon the solvency of the secret partner, opened an account with the firm, which account was kept up after the dissolution. In such case the secret partner can not claim to have been a dormant partner against such creditor, and he is liable to such creditor for debts subsequently incurred in name of the firm before the creditor had notice of its dissolution, or of the retirement of such member.</p>

Appellee Bergstrom by answer denied the partnership, and that he was not indebted to appellant. Judgment below was rendered in favor of appellant against Carter, and that it take nothing against appellee Bergstrom. From this judgment appellant prosecutes this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b176-7" data-blocks='[["BL_176.8",176,[270,1368,1294,186]]]'>The evidence shows that Carter and Bergstrom in September, 1881, entered into a copartnership for the purpose of dealing in hides, wool, and produce.
