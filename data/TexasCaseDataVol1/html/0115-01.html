It is alleged in the pleadings both of appellants and appellees that at that date said judgments were owned by said cattle company, though subject to the rights of said Boatman Savings Bank. Under said original judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank, in the months of February, March, and June, 1886, certain lands of said cattle company were sold at execution sale and the proceeds applied as credits upon said original judgment. The sales in February and March reduced the amount due on the same to about $8000, and the June sale to about $6000. The collateral judgments were allowed to become dormant. When the cattle company became insolvent it was indebted to the First National Bank of Gainesville, by note, in the sum of about $18,000, which was secured by mortgage on cattle to the extent of about $16,000. In the month of January or February, 1886, appellant Smith undertook to procure at a discount debts against the insolvent cattle company in amount sufficient to offset the two collateral judgments, and engaged one Hulen, a director in the cattle company, to assist him, or to procure them for him, agreeing to pay him one-half of what Smith might save in offsetting said judgments. He succeeded in obtaining for Smith four notes against the cattle company; one in February, 1886, called the McAdams note, for about $10,000, less a credit of some $3000; the other three in May, 1886, called the McCubbins and Rolls notes, for less amounts, the purchase being made on the 20th and the purchase price paid on the 28th of May. The McAdams note and the balance due on the original Boatman Savings Bank judgment were allowed in the court below as offsets, and the other notes were rejected. Hulen procured one Sacra, vice president of said cattle company, to assist him in obtaining said notes for Smith, which he did to the extent of giving information as to where and how to find them — Hulen agreeing to pay him one-half the profit or compensation coining to him under the arrangement with Smith.</p>

The proof failed to show that either Smith or Hulen had actual knowledge of the transfer of the judgments to Dougherty until after the offsets had been acquired, though Sacra did have such knowledge at the time of the transfer. The record discloses that some, if not all, of the notes pleaded as offsets were placed in the hands of W. O. Davis, Esq., by Smith and Hulen, in February, 1886, and that the McCubbins and Rolls notes were on the 20th day of May, as well as prior thereto, in some wajr pledged as collateral security to R. S. Rollins, vice president of said First National Bank of Gainesville, and J. M. Lindsay, an officer of Gainesville National Bank, to secure to said two banks debts due to them severally.</p>

W. Wilson as president of said cattle company, and John H. Stone, secretary, endorsed by I-Iearne to J. W. Wilson and by Wilson to Rollins; and said judgment was on said 2nd day of March, 1886, assigned by Rollins to Dougherty. On the same day said F. M. Dougherty, through J. H. Garnett, Esq., law partner of W. 0. Davis, caused a writ of garnishment to issue against appellants, and contemporaneously therewith said Wilson, at the suggestion of said Garnett, made the assignment of said other judgment as above stated.</p>

The record discloses that J. W. Wilson was indebted to Dougherty individually in the sum of about $10,000. On the 20th of May, 1886, when the rejected offsets were purchased by Smith, there were present in the office of Davis &amp; Garnett, Messrs. Garnett, Smith, Hulen, and Rollins, there being a conflict in the evidence as to whether or not Sacra was there. At this meeting Smith paid balance due on, and obtained assignment of, the original judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank. Nothing was said about the assignment of the collateral judgments against appellants at this meeting, and Smith seems to have been ignorant of that fact, and perhaps also Hulen, though the fact was known to Rollins, who was vice president of said First National Bank, and who was released by Smith as endorser on said original judgment, in which matter lie appears to have been acting for himself; but in the matter of the sale of said notes to be used as offsets he seems to have acted in behalf of said First National Bank, of which he was an officer, though not actively engaged in its service, the money realized from the sale of said notes to Smith being in part paid to said bank by him. He states that Smith, or Hulen in Smith’s presence, then and there agreed to pay the balance due on said First National Bank debt after the cattle mortgaged to it should be applied thereto, there being an estimated balance of $1800 or $2000, and that he would not have acted as he did in selling said offsets but for this promise on Smith’s or Hulen’s part. Smith and Hulen state that the promise was conditioned upon the Wichita sale reducing the amount due Smith on the original judgment to such an extent as to leave a balance of $1800 or $2000 due on the collateral judgments, after applying all offsets. It is also disclosed that the first notice that Garnett had of the notes being left with his partner was on the 2nd day of March, 1886, just after he drew up the garnishment papers, and that he did not inform Davis of the existence of the assignment of the judgments, and that this fact was not present to his mind until recalled, long after this transaction.</p>

W. Wilson had any interest in or authority to transfer the judgment in the name of the Boatman Savings Bank, or that the Boatman Savings Bank was not the owner thereof, because the transfer of the other judgment to Dougherty was made subject to the rights of the Boatman Savings Bank and it was not shown that it had parted with its interest in said judgment.

Smith said at the time of leaving the notes, the appellants’ counsel then asked him to state what Smith said when he left the notes as to his object or purpose in leaving them, expecting to prove that Smith said he left said notes for safe keeping only and to be held by Davis until Smith should call for them. This testimony was objected to by appellee, because, first, Smith could not make evidence for himself; second, the witness had no right to detail a conversation with his client, and because said conversation was hearsay.</p>
    <p id="b147-5" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[169,886,1298,830]]]'>» As this transaction occurred prior to the date of the transfer to the appellee of the judgment sought to be revived, we are unable to see how the statement by Smith could be deemed in any sense a self-serving declaration. The second objection, that he could not detail a conversation Avitli his client, is equally untenable, because a confidential communication is the privilege of the client, and not of his antagonist in litigation. It is equally clear that the testimony was not hearsay, but a verbal act coming clearly within the meaning of the rule on that subject. It was contemporaneous with the main fact under consideration and was so connected with it as to illustrate its character. See Greenl. Ev., sec. 108. Appellee in his brief seeks to sustain this ruling on the ground that Smith and Hulen had both been on the stand and testified. We fail to find in their evidence any statement of Smith’s purpose in lodging these notes with Davis. If they had testified at the trial that the purpose was to leave them for safe keeping, it seems to us that it would have been admissible to eorrobarate their evidence by the declaration made at the very time the notes were deposited.</p>

It became a material inquiry whether the knowledge on the part of Garnett of the transfer of the judgments in controversy should be imputed to Smith, on account of the alleged relationship of attorney and client between Davis and Garnett on the one hand and Smith on the other. Two theories were raised by the evidence and submitted by the court in his charge to the jury; the one that the relationship of attorney and client had been so established when the notes pleaded as offsets were placed in the hands of Davis; and the other, that they were not placed there to create or in virtue of said relationship, but for safe keeping only.</p>

In so far as lie sought to be relieved as endorser upon the original Boatman Savings Bank judgment, he was acting for himself; but in the matter of the sale of the offsets to Smith, a part of the purchase money for which he turned over to the First National Bank, he was acting in behalf of said bank; and that the charge should have submitted to the jury the theory of this dual capacity, or rather that if he was acting in behalf of the bank, and at the same time acting in his own interest, his acts would be binding upon the bank.</p>

It may be that the court should have also submitted in connection with said charge some appropriate instruction, presenting the theory, as claimed by Rollins, that at the meeting on the 20th of May, 1886, said Smith promised to pay the balance due on the bank debt, and that but for this promise he would not have acted as he did; but this is a matter of which the appellants could not complain.</p>

It is assumed by the parties to this litigation that the transaction between Smith and I-Iulen established the relation of principal and agent between them. It is contended by appellee that the transaction between Hulen and Sacra, coupled with the fact that Smith paid to Sacra, at the instance of Hulen, one-half of the sum of money he had agreed to pay Hulen, rendered Sacra also the agent of Smith, and hence that the knowledge on Sacra’s part of the assignment of the judgments sought to be revived should be imputed to Smith, though he had acquired title to the offsets prior to his knowledge of the fact that Sacra was in any way interested with Hulen in the matter. He relies upon the principle, which is well sustained by authority, that if one without authority assumes to act as the agent of another, and the latter takes the benefit of the unauthorized act by claiming rights under it or otherwise ratifying it, he must take such benefit charged with notice of such matters as appear to have been within the knowledge of the unauthorized agent at the time of the transaction. On the other hand, it is contended that the doctrine, which is also sustained by authority, that if the subagent be the agent of the agent merely, then there is no privity between him and the principal, and his knowledge can not be imputed to the principal, is applicable to the facts of this case. We have been cited to no case directly in point; and as the tendency of modern decisions is rather toward a restriction than an extension of the doctrine of implied or constructive notice in respect to agency, we are of opinion that the charge, in so far as it instructed the jury on the subject of ratification and notice as a result therefrom, was not applicable to the facts of this case. It seems to us, that when Smith purchased and paid for the notes in ignorance, as claimed by him, of the connection of Sacra with the matter, his rights were fixed and should not be prejudiced by the fact that afterward, upon the request of Hulen, he paid to Sacra one-half the sum he had agreed to pay Hulen under the contract with him.</p>
