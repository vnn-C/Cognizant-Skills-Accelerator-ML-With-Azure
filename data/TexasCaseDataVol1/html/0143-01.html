Maginn and said Edward Martin &amp; Co., which would have been executed, and by reasonable promptness on the part of said Western Union Telegraph Company in transmitting said replying message from St. Louis, Mo., to Belton, Texas, such answer could and should have been returned by 6 o’clock p. m., February 16, 1884; but plaintiff alleges, that if the same had been received by 8 or even 10 o’clock p. in. of February 16, 1884, the same would have been in time for said Martin <em>&amp; </em>Co. to have saved their indebtedness by obtaining a writ of attachment. And plaintiff alleges, that said Monteith &amp; Furman had prepared a petition, which was°in due form, and an affidavit for attachment in blank, which <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>could, upon getting a telegram, be quickly closed and completed, and Miller Brothers, bankers, of Belton, Texas, had promised upon obtaining an authorizing telegram from some good and solvent bank to go upon said attachment bond as security thereon, and A. M. Monteith stood ready to make affidavit such as is required by law upon which an attachment should issue; and arrangements had been made with the clerk of the District Court of Bell County to stand read)7 to issue writ of attachment and approve bond in legal form and with approved security, which could and would have been readily made if a proper answer had been made to said telegram which had been promptly returned to Belton. And plaintiff alleges, that he stood ready and willing to answer said telegram, and could readily and promptly have provided an attachment bond through a good and reliable bank in St. Louis, Mo., who would have telegrahed Miller Brothers to make bond for Edward Martin, and the said bank would save said Miller Brothers from all loss and damage whatever.</blockquote>

Woodworth sufficient to satisfy said indebtedness of Edward Martin &amp; Co. attached, and said indebtedness of Samuel T. Woodworth fully paid and discharged, and that there was good and legal grounds for the issuance of said writ of attachment for such purpose.
