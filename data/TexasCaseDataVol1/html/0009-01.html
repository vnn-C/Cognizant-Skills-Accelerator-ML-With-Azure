That the sole consideration for the conveyance of said land to Pierce, was the other tracts of land mentioned, which defendant pretended to own, and for which <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>he at the same time executed a deed to plaintiff. That plaintiff was the father-in-law of Pierce, and lived in Pierce’s house as a member of his family up to the time of his death.

Pierce, contrary to his representations and agreement, immediately placed on record in Tarrant County the deed which plaintiff had executed to him; that plaintiff was informed, and believed and averred, that Pierce had no title to the lands which he pretended to convey to plaintiff in exchange for the Tarrant County land, and that his intention was to defraud the plaintiff and obtain the deed from him without any consideration. Plaintiff did not claim, and had never, since he discovered Pierce’s fraudulent intent, claimed any right, title, or interest in the lands which Pierce pretended to convey to him, and renounced any and all right under said deed or deeds, by which Pierce pretended to convey to him said lands, and offered to reconvey the same to the administrator for the use of said Pierce’s estate. That plaintiff did not learn that Pierce would not return to him the deed, which he had obtained under the pretext of looking at it, until the-day of November, 1886, at which time he refused to return the same to plaintiff. Said deed was charged to be in the possession of the defendant or the administrator of Pierce’s estate, and notice was given to defendant to produce the sainé at the trial.

That Pierce was plaintiff’s confidential adviser in all matters; was the agent of plaintiff and acted for him in all business matters, especially in rendering for taxation his property to the assessors, and paying taxes. He also had in his hands all the money and available claims and credits which belonged to plaintiff, and acted for plaintiff in everything; that said agency and attorneyship continued in full force during all the time up to November, 1886, and he did during all the said time all the acts required by his agency, especially assessing property and paying taxes, and he used all the advantages arising from his position to conceal from plaintiff his fraudulent design to defraud plaintiff and the fact that he had not title to said land.</p>

Pierce had advised plaintiff not to record his deed, and relying on Pierce as his lawyer and sOn-in-law, he had failed to do so. That when, on May —, 1884, Pierce requested plaintiff to allow him to examine the deed, he fraudulently represented that he merely wanted to look over it, and deceitfully promised to return the same, but he really intended to possess himself of said deed, so that he might destroy or suppress the same, which he did.</p>

Plaintiff averred that he did not learn that Pierce had no title to the lands which he pretented to give in exchange for said Tarrant County land until long after his refusal to return said deed; that the lands which Pierce pretended to give in exchange were situated in a distant part of the State, and plaintiff had no access to. the title papers to the same, nor to the record of such papers, and that Pierce fraudulently withheld the fact that the title to his said lands was bad, and adroitly concealed, by false promises and many professions of honesty, his intention to suppress said deed, and keep the Tarrant County land; and the plaintiff, who was very old and without money, could not, by any diligence, discover the wrong which Pierce was meditating.</p>

He was also Lee’s business.manager, gave in his property for taxes, paid taxes, brought suits, and gave Lee. advice. At the time of the trial in 1890, Lee was eighty-two years old, and his eyesight was defective, but he could see better in 1881. He was able to read and write.

In this case the appellee had four years within which to bring his suit from the date of the deed which he sought to rescind; or if he did not then immediately discover the fraud which he alleged had been practiced in securing said deed from him, then within four years from the time of the discovery of such fraud; provided, that it must be discovered within a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time would vary according to the facts and circumstances attending and subsequent to the transactions which, in their nature, tend to prevent a discovery of the fraud; and it would sometimes be a mixed question of law and of fact.</p>
    <p id="b40-7" data-blocks='[["BL_40.6",40,[272,1325,1299,822]]]'>There was no error in submitting the question of . reasonable time to the jury, if the facts alleged in the petition are of such a nature as ought to excuse the plaintiff, Lee, from discovering the fraud, which, he alleged, had been practiced upon him by Pierce. We think the allegations were sufficient. As alleged in the petition, Lee was an old man, and resided with Pierce, who was his son-in-law; and, as an attorney-at-law, was his legal adviser, as well as his agent for the transaction of all his business. The deeds for the land were prepared by Pierce, and delivered to Lee with the advice not to record them. Relying on Pierce’s representations as to the deeds, and the value of the lands, and to pay taxes, there was no occasion for Lee to examine the deeds, or inquire after the lands. The time which elapsed from the date of the transaction until the suit was instituted, was about fifteen months more than the period of limitation. We are not prepared to say, as a matter of law, that this was not a reasonable time, and that the fraud should have been sooner discovered. Plaintiff’s petition also showed a good cause of action for the rescinding of the deed.</p>

The rule of evidence in cases of fraud is liberal, and justly so. In this case it was alleged that Pierce procured the conveyance of the Tarrant County lands in order to defraud the plaintiff; and that plaintiff had not received any value for them; that when Pierce delivered the deeds to Lee, he advised him not to record them, and, sometime afterward, induced Lee to return them to him. The evidence tended to show the fraudulent design of Pierce from the beginning as a culmination thereof, and was admissible for that purpose.</p>

Rule 29 of Supreme Court, in force when the brief of appellants was prepared, is as follows: “ The appellant, or plaintiff in error, in order to prepare properly a case for submission when called, shall have filed a brief of the points relied on, in accordance with and confined to the distinct specifications of error (which assignments shall be copied into the brief) and to such fundamental errors of law as are apparent upon the record, each ground of error being separately presented under the proper assignment; and each assignment not so copied and accompanied with its appropriate propositions and statements, shall be regarded as abandoned.”</p>

Because it fails to instruct the jury that the burden of proving an excuse for Lee’s delay in bringing suits was on Lee. 2. Because it did not charge that the burden was on Lee to show that he had not been guilty of ordinary neglect in failing to discover before February 4, 1883, the fraud practiced by Pierce in obtaining from Lee the conveyance sought to be canceled. 3. Because the definition of ordinary diligence and care, as given in the charge, is incorrect as applied to this case and was misleading to the jury. 4. The charge gives improper directions as to how they should determine upon Lee’s excuse for failing to discover the fraud practiced in November, 1881, before the 4th of February, 1883, as the age, relationship, and condition of the parties would furnish no excuse for any lack of diligence on Lee’s part, and <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>could only be considered by the jury in determining whether Pierce’s acts were sufficient to defeat ordinary diligence on Lee’s part for a year, three months, and three days.”</p>

    <p id="b42-6" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[277,720,1298,483]]]'>Upon the issue as to whether or not the fraud might not have been discovered by Lee, the jury was instructed by the court: “If you believe that Lee exercised ordinary diligence and care, and did not discover the fraud, if any was committed by Pierce, prior to February 4, 1883, or if, by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, Lee could not have learned of the fraud, if any was committed by Pierce, before the 4th of February, 1883, then the cause of action is not barred by limitation. What is meant by ordinary diligence and care, is such diligence and care as men of ordinary prudence exercise with reference to their own property.”</p>

It was proper also to instruct the jury to take into consideration all of the attendant circumstances which would tend to excuse Lee from any lack of diligence in the discovery of the fraud. His great age, the relationship of Pierce to him, both by family ties and as his trusted attorney and agent, and the condition of the parties, are all matters that should be considered by the jury in determining whether or not Lee exercised proper diligence.</p>
    <p id="b42-9" data-blocks='[["BL_42.7",42,[275,1613,1296,187]]]'>Appellant’s thirty-second assignment of error is: “That the verdict is not supported by the evidence, and the judgment does not dispose of the questions involved in this case, there being no judgment divesting title out of Lee to the lands which Pierce exchanged to Lee.”</p>
