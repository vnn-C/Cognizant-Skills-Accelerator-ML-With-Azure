Immaterial Issue. — Sureties made defense that they were induced to sign the note sued upon by the false representation by the principal and the payees that it was secured by a chattel mortgage upon a flock of sheep. The jury sustained the plea. <em>Held, </em>upon a judgment for the defendants’ sureties, such judgment could have been rendered upon such plea, and that it could not be assumed that the court necessarily had found upon another hypothesis, viz., that the sheep had been mortgaged, and the security lost by negligence of the plaintiffs.</p>

Care and Diligence by Creditor Holding Security. — When property is pledged to the creditor by mortgage or otherwise to secure a debt, and he has the right to control the property, he becomes a trustee for the surety as well as the principal, and he rests under the same obligations that other trustees do under like circumstances — reasonable care and diligence for the preservation of the property, to the end that the debt be paid. Grounds of loss were that the creditor had failed to register the mortgage, whereby the property became subject to other liens, and had permitted part of the property to be shipped off and sold. These would release the surety.</p>
