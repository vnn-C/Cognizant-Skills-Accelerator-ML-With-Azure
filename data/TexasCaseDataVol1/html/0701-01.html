Survey 25, in the name of Anselmo Gallan, is described as south of survey 24, in the name of Thomas Thatcher, the former calling for the south line of the latter.</p>

Braden, who owned the southern portion of 24, which title he pleads. *</p>
    <p id="b726-7" data-blocks='[["BL_726.10",726,[256,1264,1298,834]]]'>Plaintiff replied, denying the answer, and alleging that the land in suit was not a part of 24, but was a part of 25; also, that some twelve years before, Ed. Braden, being in possession of that part of the land of survey 24 next adjoining the land in suit on the north, erected a division fence on what was then considered by him and plaintiff the division line between the two surveys, plaintiff then owning survey 25; that the fence has remained where it was placed, and is now standing; that it was tacitly, if not expressly, agreed by plaintiff and Braden at that time and ever afterward to be the division line between the two surveys; that in 1884, plaintiff being the owner of survey 25, desiring to enclose the land, obtained Braden’s consent and agreement that plaintiff should join on to the division fence, which both had considered and agreed was the division line, whereby both parties acted on the former understanding and tacit agreement that the fence was on the line; and plaintiff did join to the same, enclosing the strip in question, since which time he has been in the quiet possession of the same until ejected by defendant, as alleged in original petition.</p>

Survey 24 calls its south line as running from a mound, west 1547 varas to a stake, from which two mesquites are named as bearings. The north line of survey 25 calls for the south line of No. 24, and to run with its full length 1547 varas between two other surveys, and at the northwest corner of 25 the same witness trees are called for that are named to identify the southwest corner of 24. There is evidence tending to show that the line of 24 is where plaintiff claims it to be — enough to support such a conclusion if the court had so found; but there is testimony tending to show that it can not be identified on the ground, and that distance will leave a vacancy between the two surveys.</p>

We do not intend to say that it is an open line, for there is some evidence to fix it on the ground as identical with the Braden fence, and quite enough to sustain that conclusion, if it had been so found by the court below.
