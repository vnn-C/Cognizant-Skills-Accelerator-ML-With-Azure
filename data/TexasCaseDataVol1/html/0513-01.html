Upon the trial of this cause, the plaintiff’s counsel, having previously interrogated the defendant as to the payment of money made by him to H. C. McIntyre, Jr., about the first of October, 1883, the day preceding the transaction with the plaintiff, and a payment made by him to N. E. Dever, the sheriff of Washington County, in December, 1884, proposed to prove by these witnesses the following facts: By witness McIntyre, that the defendant was indebted to the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railway Company on a bill of freight amounting to about $200, and that defendant came into the office of witness, he being the agent for the railway, and placed upon witness’ desk a roll of money, which defendant averred contained $200, but which, in fact, contained only $180; that witness discovered the shortage after the defendant had left the office, but before he had finished taking his freight from the depot, and witness immediately called on the defendant and demanded that he make good the shortage, which defendant did after some hesitation. Several persons were present when this occurred, and in their presence the witness counted the money; that witness was busy at the time the roll of money was placed with him by defendant, and defendant was also in a hurry in making the payment and hauling off his freight. By the witness Dever, that in December, 1884, in making payment of a lot of goods sold to him by witness at attachment sale, the purchase amounting to over $2000, defendant tendered to witness four packages of money which he represented to con-1500 each; said tender was made late in the evening, and at a time when witness was very busy winding up the sales and other transactions of the day, and matters were in some confusion. Upon counting up the bills in said packages, one of them was found to contain only $380, to-wit, 38 bills of $10 each. The other three packages contained each $500. Upon witness calling defendant’s attention to the fact that there was a deficit of $120 in one of the packages, he stated in explanation that one of his boys had taken out of the package some money to pay for some <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>cotton, and that he (defendant) had forgotten the circumstance. This evidence, when offered by plaintiff, was objected to by defendant, on the ground that the same was incompetent and irrevelant, and not proper matter of cross-examination or impeachment, and the objections were sustained and all of the evidence excluded, to which ruling of the court the plaintiff excepted, and upon appeal assigns the exclusion of this evidence as error.</p>

While the excluded evidence was not admissible to show that the roll contained less than $1000, if this fact be established by other evidence then the excluded evidence would be admissible as tending to show that defendant knew that to be a fact when he delivered the roll, and falsely represented it to contain $1000.
