This is clearly a mistake. Denouncement corresponds more nearly to our file on vacant lands than any other proceeding. It is not a remedy for adjudging a forfeiture, but the Mexican method of filing on land, alike applicable to land always vacant as to land made vacant by act of a grantee from the State. It is not prosecuted by or for the State, but by and for the individual availing himself of it.

There is a clear distinction between the effect of a public grant to a nonresident foreigner or to a colonist abandoning the grant, and the effect of a private sale to a nonresident alien. As to the first, a forfeiture would result in the land remaining the property of the State, who was the grantor, thereby becoming or remaining vacant, subject to denouncement by a Mexican for his own benefit. The second would result in the land remaining the property of the vendor, subject, under law 6, title 5, book 3, to forfeiture, when the proceeding therefor has been enacted and applied. Holliman v.

At common law an alien could acquire title by purchase — not by descent; but he could not hold by purchase against the State. He could not acquire title by descent. An inquest of office was necessary in the first instance, because he had acquired title; but not in the second, because he could not acquire anything to be forfeited. By the law in force in Texas on May 25, 1836, a nonresident alien could neither acquire nor hold title to real estate. Both prohibitions are found in the laws of 1828, 1835, and 1836, and it is too plain for honest, intelligent denial, that a nonresident alien could neither acquire nor hold land in Texas on May 25, 1836.
