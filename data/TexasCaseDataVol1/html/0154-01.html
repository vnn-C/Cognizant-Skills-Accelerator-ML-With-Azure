The record shows that it was mutually admitted in open court that appellees have title to the W. C. Sparks league along and down to the south line thereof, and that the appellants have title to the Joseph West survey and a portion of the Alexander McKenzie survey abutting on the Sparks league; that the Sparks league is the older survey; and the only matter in issue was the true position on the ground of the south boundary line of the <em>W. </em>C. Sparks league, and all the evidence related to this one issue.</p>

    <p id="b180-10" data-blocks='[["BL_180.9",180,[273,1312,1300,584]]]'>These assignments are well taken. Though nominally an action of trespass to try title, the agreement of the parties and the evidence made the case a boundary suit only. In such a case the verdict and judgment should definitely fix and establish the location of the line in dispute with reference to some known object then in existence, concerning the identity and locality of which there is no dispute. If the plaintiffs’ petition describes the particular land in'dispute and the line in controversy in this manner, then a general verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs under appropriate instructions will be sufficient. If it does not, then the charge ought to direct the jury to, and by their verdict they should, designate the line, or a corner from which it could be surveyed and fixed, by stating its course and distance from such established and undisputed object.</p>

Hence this suit, the very purpose of which is to determine where said line is: and the judgment should definite^ fix its locality with reference to some object permanent in its nature, easily found, and now existing on the ground.</p>
