If the defendant, in enclosing its own • land, which surrounded the, land of plaintiff, necessarily enclosed the land of plaintiff, but made no claim of title to same, and placed none of its fences on plaintiff’s land, and did not refuse plaintiff the use and occupation thereof, but offered him free access thereto, the plaintiff could not be allowed to recover rents. If there was any servitude on defendant’s land in favor of plaintiff, giving him a way of necessity, the defendant had-, provided such way by the erection of gates; and it even does not appear that the gates were not near the land and convenient. But the owner of the servient tenement has the right to designate a way of necessity to suit his own convenience. Russell v.

If it should be claimed that plaintiff has a right to a way under section 5 of statute of January 30, 1884, General Laws, 69, then we say that this would not entitle him to a recovery of rents under the pleadings and evidence. And further, the statute is in conflict with the Constitution, in practically authorizing the appropriation of the property and labor of one to the use of another without compensation. Railway v.

The enclosure of said company is used by the same as a pasture, and the cattle of said company were permitted to graze upon the said survey in controversy, as well as upon any other portion of the land enclosed in their pasture — the outer boundaries of the tract sued for having never been fenced.</p>
    <p id="b413-8" data-blocks='[["BL_413.8",413,[191,1027,1295,84]]]'>4. The rental value of the land in controversy, for the two years prior to the institution of the suit, is §78.95.</p>

    <p id="b413-10" data-blocks='[["BL_413.10",413,[190,1226,1298,235]]]'>6. Before the pasture was fenced by the company, the southern line thereof had been fenced by the Lucerne Cattle Company. A considerable portion of the eastern boundary thereof had also been fenced by the Lucerne Cattle Company, the fence so built being still owned by the Lucerne company.</p>
    <p id="b413-11" data-blocks='[["BL_413.11",413,[189,1474,1299,136]]]'>7. A portion of the western boundary of the pasture had been fenced by the Iowa Cattle Company, and was and is still the property of said Iowa company. .</p>

The St. Louis Cattle Companj' notified the agents of plaintiff that he could at any time take possession of his land, and protect and use the same, and that if enclosed within its pasture, this was only so done that the company might use and enjoy its own lands as a pasture, such being the purpose for which they were purchased, and that the company could not pay rent for the plaintiff’s tract, as it had been advised that" it was not liable for rent, as demanded by plaintiff’s agents, under the circumstances of its enclosure.</p>

Davis v. Davis, 70 Texas, 123; Buford v. Houtz, <a href="/us/133/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="133 U.S. 320" data-case-ids="1129261" data-case-paths="/us/133/0320-01">133 U. S., 320</a>. This doctrine, however, does not authorize the owner of cattle, by affirmative conduct on his part, to appropriate the use of such lands to his own benefit. He will not be permitted thus to ignore the truth that every one is entitled to the exclusive enjoyment of his own property. In this case, the appellant, by means of fences constructed or maintained by it, enclosed the land of the appellee in such manner as to reap from it those benefits which, as a rule, are incident exclusively to ownership. The use and enjoyment of the property under such circumstances imports necessarily the idea of liability.</p>
