Warrantor — Plaintiffs Right to Call in. — Appellant had the right to have his warrantor cited to come in and maintain the title and make good his warranty. The provisions of our statutes (Revised Statutes, article 4788) allowing warrantors to be brought in by defendants in trespass to try title, does not change any rule of practice which may allow to the plaintiff the same remedy. Whether the plaintiff in this suit could recover judgment upon his warranty is not necessary (in the disposition we shall make of the case) to determine; but he had the right to bring him in to maintain the title, and to be concluded by the judgment, and it was error to sustain the general demurrer.</p>

Adverse Possession. — About sixteen years before suit C. entered upon the north half of the 300 acres tract of land in controversy, supposing it was vacant and desiring to pre-empt it. In 1859 the then owners of the north and south half agreed to a partition; one of them was to take the north half and the other the south. The tract was a rectangle, and could be divided by a right line through the center from east to west. No actual partition line was run, but subsequent deeds in the chain of title which were recorded recognized such partition. By a transaction with G., the owner of the south half, C. claims to have bought all of G.:s interest in the 300 acres, but no deed was made. In 1883, the then owners of the north half conveyed it to C., describing the north half, but the deed further stated that they conveyed all the interest that D. (a former owner) had in the whole tract, but they only warranted 150 acres. C. had paid taxes on the whole tract.

    <p class="headnotes" id="b297-6" data-blocks='[["BL_297.5",297,[192,484,1300,319]]]'>4. Same. — Under the peculiar language of the deed from Townsend and Chesnut to appellee, and its correspondence with and apparent recognition of the true condition of the title, it can not be held that appellee’s possession of the north half should he extended by construction to the boundaries of the whole tract. That possession was consistent with the claim of appellant to the south half, and if there had been no partition appellee’s possession would have been that of a tenant in common, and would not have been adverse to the owner of the other undivided half-interest.</p>

    <p id="b298-8" data-blocks='[["BL_298.7",298,[279,1127,1297,388]]]'>Granad conveyed an undivided half-interest in the land to one Finley, Who, in 1859, conveyed to James Gibson. Gibson and Granad agreed on a partition by which Gibson was to take the south half. No actual line was established, but the land was in the shape of a rectangle, and it was only necessary in order to divide it in halves to run a line through 'the center east and west. On July 17, 1884, Gibson conveyed the southern half of the tract to Alfred Chesnut, from whom appellant derives his title by regular chain of transfers. . '</p>
    <p id="b298-9" data-blocks='[["BL_298.8",298,[274,1526,1299,576]]]'>Appellee Collins entered upon the north half of the land about sixteen or eighteen years before the trial, supposing it to be vacant and intending to pre-empt it. Sometime afterward there was a transaction between him and Gibson, in which he claims to have bought all of Gibson’s interest in the 300 acres. Gibson claims that he only agreed not to interfere with appellee’s efforts to acquire title to the north half by pre-emption. Collins paid Gibson $20, and gave his note for $30, as the consideration of the agreement. No deed was made, and it was not shown that Collins has made any improvement on the faith of the agreement, and the note was never paid. On March 27, 1883, the heirs of William Granad, who was then dead, conveyed to Mary Duke “all their right, title, and interest in the 300 acres.”</p>

P. Rhodes, it being the same that we purchased from Mary Duke by deed bearing date May 25, 1883; for a full and complete description of said land reference is made to the patent from the State of Texas to Wm. Granad, assignee of T. P. Rhodes, which is herewith delivered and made a part of this conveyance. It is understood that we convey all the rights, title, and interest that Mrs. Mary Duke had to the T. P. Rhodes 300 acres survey of land, but we only warrant the title to 150 acres of said survey, it being the north half, and the part on which T. F. Collins now resides.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b299-6" data-blocks='[["BL_299.5",299,[154,990,1301,387]]]'>At the time this deed was made Collins had full knowledge of the title in Gibson. Townsend and Chesnut both testified that he recognized Gibson’s title, and that they all understood that only the north half was conveyed, but that Collins being fearful that Gibson, by reason of his title, papers calling for an undivided portion, would claim an interest in the north half, the deed, in order to quiet these apprehensions, was drawn so-that, in case Gibson interfered with Collins on the north half, the latter could claim an interest in the other part.</p>
    <p id="b299-7" data-blocks='[["BL_299.6",299,[152,1386,1300,536]]]'>Collins testified, that he bought the entire 300 acres from Townsend and Chesnut, and that they told him they were selling him the entire tract, but would warrant the title only as to the north half. He further testified, that lie had paid taxes on the whole tract, and had claimed the whole tract, had cultivated, used, and enjoyed it ever since he went into possession. None of his improvements were on the south half. He does not deny the conversations testified to by Townsend and Chesnut, in which he seems to have recognized the Gibson title, and it does not appear that Gibson or any of his vendees ever learned that Collins was claiming the whole of the tract until it was ascertained that he was paying taxes on it. How long this was before the suit does not appear.</p>

The sustaining of Chesnut’s general demurrer and adjudging against appellant the costs of bringing him into the suit was error. Appellant had the right to have his warrantor cited to come in and maintain the title and make good his warranty. The right of a plaintiff to do this has been denied by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, while it was admitted that a defendant could. Ferrell v.

It is not pretended by appellee in his testimony that when he originally entered he had possession of or asserted claim to any part of the south half of the land, but he says he entered upon the north half with intent to pre-empt. If he had thus possessed himself of the southern part of the land, in the effort to acquire title by pre-emption, this, it seems, would not be a possession adverse to the true owner. Schleicher v.
