Agency — Knowledge of Agent not Imputed to Principal, when. — On a defaulting city collector’s official bond, two of the city aldermen, with other persons, were sureties. The board of aldermen proposed to accept, in full settlement of the bond, a deed of the collector’s homestead, worth but little more than half the amount of the default. Such deed was made, and was accepted by the board of aldermen at a meeting at which said two aldermen, members thereof, were present. The collector, joined by his wife, sued to recover the property, alleging that the deed was procured by means of threats, intimidation of the wife, etc., on the part of the two surety aldermen, and a demurrer to the petition was sustained. <em>Meld:</em>

Our conclusion is, that these two aldermen were interested adversely to the city in procuring said deed to be made in order to secure their release from liability on said bond. The fact that they were present in the city council when the deed was accepted would not charge the city with notice of the circumstances under which it was procured. The knowledge of an agent acquired in the transaction of his own private business is not ordinarily imputed <em>to the </em>principal. Kauffman <em>&amp; </em>Runge v. Robey, 60 Texas, 308. As to whether such knowledge is imputed to the principal, if present to the mind of the agent while subsequently engaged in a transaction for the principal, the authorities are conflicting. One of the grounds upon which said knowledge is imputed is, that it is the duty of the agent to •communicate it to the principal. This being the reason of the rule, it is held that the rule does not apply where the agent has a personal interest in a matter which would lead him to conceal his knowledge from his prin<a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>cipal, though cases may be found in conflict with this holding.

If these two aldermen had been guilty of obtaining the wife’s signature and acknowledgment by means of duress and fraud, as alleged by appellants, it is morally certain that they would not have communicated this knowledge to the city council — the governing body of said city — when said deed was accepted; and we therefore think that their knowledge of the alleged fraud should not be imputed to the city.</p>
