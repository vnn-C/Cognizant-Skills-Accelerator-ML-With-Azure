    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[271,623,1297,486]]]'>2. The law distinguishes between causes sufficient to relieve a common carrier against loss or total failure to deliver, and those that will excuse the carrier from delay in delivery. In the one case, the loss can not be relieved against unless it result from the act of God or the public enemy; and in the other, the cause, although not inevitable or produced by the act of God, may be sufficient to excuse the delay. The reason for the distinction is, the law binds the carrier to deliver absolutely, unless prevented by the act of God or the public enemy, but only requires delivery to be made within a reasonable time; the question what is a reasonable time to be tested by the facts and surroundings of each particular case.</p>

That the cattle in the yards and pens at Taylor, when appellees’ cattle were tendered for shipment, were received for shipment after the day on which appellees applied for cars to be at the station on the 30th of May, did not under the facts give appellees the right to priority or precedence of shipment over the other cattle.

It is lawful for a common carrier, in good faith and without any purpose of discriminating against other shippers, to contract in advance for the receipt and transportation of freight on its line on a certain day, and to give such freight precedence; and especially is this true with reference to live stock, which, from its very nature, requires a fixed time to be agreed upon for its tender by the shipper and receipt by the carrier; and appellees’ cattle could have been shipped out when tendered if they had been given precedence. The authorities cited by appellants in support of said propositions all apply to the transportation of freight tendered in regular course, without any prior <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>agreement or understanding between the shipper and carrier.

The law which requires railway carriers to receive the cars and freight from connecting lines and to transport the same, does not intend that preference shall be given to such cars or freight over freight which the carrier has already legally bound itself to receive and transport on a day certain. To do this would be to subordinate the business of the carrier to that of its connecting lines, which can not be the purpose of the law. Rev. Stats., art. 4251.</p>

The promise of appellants’ agent to have cars for the transportation of appellees’ cattle at Taylor Station on May 30, provided the cars could be gotten, was equivalent to promising to receive and transport appellees’ cattle at said station on said date, provided the cars could be gotten; and appellants having gotten the cars, they can not excuse their refusal to receive and transport the said cattle when tendered by appellees, upon the ground of an unforeseen and unexpected contingency, such as an unusual and unprecedented rush of business. In other words, appellants having charged themselves with the duty of receiving and transporting appellees’ cattle, provided they could get the necessary cars, and having gotten them, they were bound to make their promise good or respond in damages, which it is agreed in this case equals the amount of the judgment.
