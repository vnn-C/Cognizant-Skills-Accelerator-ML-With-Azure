Leavell vested absolute title in the latter, and the title was in him at the time plaintiff bought at the two execution sales against S. H. Leavell. Ruffier v. Womack, 30 Texas, 332; Harvey v.

B. Leavell was put in possession of said property by S. H. Leavell, and has remained in possession ever since.</p>
    <p id="b417-9" data-blocks='[["BL_417.7",417,[198,1121,1299,387]]]'>Upon this statement of facts the trial court concluded that the conveyance from S. H. to J. B.

Leavell of the possession of the property, he would have to pay the amount secured by said mortgage, and entered judgment accordingly, foreclosing the mortgage lien in favor of J. B.

    <p id="b417-10" data-blocks='[["BL_417.8",417,[199,1570,1299,187]]]'>The first and second assignments of error assert the proposition that the conveyance from S. II. to J. B.

    <p id="b417-11" data-blocks='[["BL_417.9",417,[197,1768,1303,574]]]'>The remaining assignments assert, in different forms, the proposition that the conveyance from J. B. to S. H.

Leavell in the property, whether as vendee or mortgagee, and that the subsequent return of said deed to him did not have the effect of reinstating his prior rights. It seems to be well settled, that a deed can not be delivered to the grantee as an escrow to take effect on a condition not appearing on its face. Heffron v. Cunningham, 76 Texas, 312; Lott v.

Dev. on Deeds, secs. 303-305. We have not been cited to any case in this State in which this doctrine of estoppel is directly affirmed or denied.</p>
    <p id="b418-5" data-blocks='[["BL_418.4",418,[263,481,1301,428]]]'>In the case of Van Hook v. Simmons, 25 Texas Supplement, 324, it is held, that a parol agreement between the grantor and the grantee to destroy the deed of conveyance from the former to the latter, and to take back the land, would not destroy the effect of such conveyance and divest the estate of the latter, in the absence of proof of the actual destruction of the deed. It is expressly stated, in the opinion by Chief Justice Wheeler, that it was not necessary in that case to consider in what cases the cancellation of the deed would have effect and operate in the nature of a surrender to divest the estate.</p>
    <p id="b418-6" data-blocks='[["BL_418.5",418,[259,929,1304,934]]]'>In Stanley v. Epperson, 45 Texas, 654, in an opinion delivered by Moore, Associate Justice, this doctrine of estoppel was applied to a case where, by permission of all parties to the deed, the title was attempted to be conveyed from the grantee to a third party by an erasure of the grantee’s name and the substitution of that of the third party. While the weight of authority seems to be against the doctrine, it is well settled in Massachusetts and a few other States; and in that opinion of Judge Moore the case of Commonwealth v. Dudley, 10 Massachusetts, 430, is referred to with approval. If, therefore, the rule governing the conveyance of title to land should be deemed applicable to the mere release of the lien (which we do not decide), we would be inclined to adopt the principle announced in Stanley v. Epperson as applicable here, and to hold, that S. H. Leavell would be estopped from recovering the possession of the property in controversy after the voluntary surrender of the deed; and that appellant would likewise be estopped, as he would occupy no better position than S. H. Leavell, all his right having been acquired subsequent to the surrender of said deed, without showing any facts that would entitle him to occupy a superior position by virtue of the rights of an execution creditor, secured without notice, or of a bona fide purchaser.</p>

Although the question was not raised in the court below, and is not raised here, still' it is so obvious that we could not reverse and render a judgment for appellant on account of the deficiency in his pleading, that we must hold that no other judgment could properly have been rendered by the trial court than was rendered. His petition followed the statutory form in suits of this character, and contained nothing more. Appellee J. B. Leavell, by way of defense and cross-action, set up his debt and mortgage against S. H. Leavell and prayed a foreclosure, as he was bound to do in order to obtain that relief in this suit. Bosse v. Johnson, 73 Texas, 608. In answer to this, S. H. Leavell filed only a general denial, and appellant made no reply whatever. The case therefore comes clearly <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>within the rule, that in an action of trespass to try title, where the defendant pleads specially his title and asks for affirmative relief, and plaintiff has matter' in avoidance, the proof of it will not be admitted, and if admitted, will not authorize a recovery by virtue thereof in the absence of its being alleged in his pleading.
