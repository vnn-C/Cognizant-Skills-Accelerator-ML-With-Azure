Pleadings — Specifications.—In an action for the contract value of machinery constructed by the plaintiff, but not completed within the time specified in the contract, in excuse for the delay the petition charged the defendant with obstructing the completion of the work, without stating facts constituting such obstruction. Exceptions urged to this general allegation should have been sustained. It was error to overrule the exceptions and admit testimony under the allegation excepted to.</p>

The question is, would the loss of profits be the direct result of the breach of the contract declared on, and would such loss reasonably be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties at the time of making the contract? See example.</p>

Measure of Damages — Profits.—In a contract for construction of an ice machine by a day certain, it appeared that the machine was relied upon to furnish a given quantity of ice upon an existing contract. <em>Held, </em>that losses suffered upon such contract from the delay in the completion of the work were chargeable to the contractor, and formed a basis for recovery of damages. But under a general allegation of expected profits from the ice business during the season, and which were lost by the failure, etc., no recovery could be had.</p>

Measure of Damages — Double Recovery. — A defective ice machine was the subject of litigation between the contractor furnishing it and the purchaser.

The court erred in overruling defendant’s special exception, to the effect that the allegation in the petition, that defendant obstructed plaintiff in the performance of the contract, is insufficient, in that it does not allege what particular acts of obstruction defendant committed, there being no allegation in the petition charging defendant with any particular acts of obstruction, the petition only alleging in general terms that plaintiff was delayed in the construction of the machinery by the misconduct of defendant, and that defendant continually threw obstacles in the way of plaintiff, and prevented it from making the test as agreed upon, no facts being alleged. The court also erred in admitting testimony under such defective allegation. Holman v. Chriswell, 13 Texas, 38; Whitaker v. Record, 25 Texas Supp., 382; Mims v. Mitchell, 1 Texas, 446; Express Co. v.

A party injured by the breach of a contract is entitled to recover all his damages resulting therefrom, including gains prevented as well as losses sustained, provided they are directly caused or naturally result from said breach, and are sufficiently certain, both in their nature and in respect to the cause from which they proceed, as to be susceptible of proof by evidence legally admissible and sufficient in law. Where there is- a loss of profits occasioned by a breach of contract, such loss is held to naturally result from said breach, in a legal sense, whenever the parties to such contract took said loss into consideration when such contract was entered into, and contracted with reference thereto, or whenever it was known, prior to the breach of such contract, by the party subsequently breaking same, that a loss of profits would directly result from such breach, and he broke the contract with the knowledge of the necessary result of his breach.</p>

The right to recover loss of profits as damages for breach of a contract is mainly dependent upon the sufficiency of the evidence to establish that profits would have been realized from the performance of the contract, and that they are capable of being estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty. The right to recover such damages, therefore, must always depend upon the facts of each case, and the court can not, upon demurrer, decide as a matter of law that the loss is too remote, or that the estimate will be too uncertain, to authorize a recovery in the case before it.

That the principal season for selling ice in San Antonio begins the first of March and ends the first of November of each year. That the trade of defendant demanded a machine that would manufacture forty tons of ice daily. That with the view to meet the demands of its trade, and to carry out its contract, it became necessary to increase the capacity of its plant, to remove parts of its machinery and improve with other machinery, as advised by plaintiff, which machinery plaintiff proposed to furnish, and to effect such ends it entered into the contract with plaintiff on the 26th day of December, 1887, which is herein before set out in full.

That the cost of operating it was greater than agreed, in labor, fuel, and ammonia. That during the delay defendant’s machine was idle. That the ice factories in San Antonio could not supply the demands of their trades, and defendant could not purchase ice in San Antonio to supply its trade, and on account of the cost of shipment ice could not be purchased elsewhere and brought <a id="p691" href="#p691" data-label="691" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*691</a>to San Antonio and sold at a profit.

The law does not condemn profits as such as a measure of damages. The question is, would the loss of profits be the direct result of the breach, and would such loss “ reasonably be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties at. the time of making the contract?” Conjectural profits would not be allowed, not for the reason that profits are proscribed, but because they are uncertain; if they become sufficiently certain, are the direct result of the breach, and the parties were in possession of such facts as would charge them, as reasonably intelligent men, with the probable consequences of the breach, then profits fall within the rule, and may be recoverable as damages.

Expected profits in business are generally too uncertain and remote. But every case will depend upon its own facts. In this case, we think the allegations of expected profits from the manufacture and sale of ice during the season would not be a sufficiently reliable and certain basis for estimating the damages for failure to furnish the plant according to the contract; but the profits that would have been made on'the Kampman contract may be recovered if proved as alleged. The allegation makes them ascertainable from elements known to the parties at the time the contract was made. Plaintiff, represented by McDonald, its president, knew that defendant had made the contract with Kampman to furnish him 1000 tons of ice for $9000 paid, as well as the terms of the same as to time of delivery; he, McDonald, knew all the conditions; that the plant lie agreed to furnish would be relied on to make this ice; he knew, it is alleged, the cost of production of ice on his proposed machinery, $1.50 per ton, and that there was to be no further expense on the part of defendant, as the ice was to be delivered at the factory door. It seems that there can be no doubt but that the profits ascertainable from the contract were in contemplation of the parties when they made the contract sued on. The contract sued on was made with special reference to the Kampman con<a id="p692" href="#p692" data-label="692" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*692</a>tract, and that defendant would be entitled to profits to be had on the latter until it was completed during the time of the alleged delay. The general profits expected from the business lack the necessary elements of certainty of computation; the parties may have supposed there would be profits in the business, yet the amount could not have been reasonably determined, owing to the fluctuations of the market price, and other con-' siderations. The price was fixed for the amount of ice to be delivered to Kampman.</p>

This conclusion will also apply to the ruling of the court in sustaining plaintiff’s exceptions to the sixth count in the answer, which sets up actual loss on the part of defendant in procuring ice at great expense for the Kampman contract. The cost of supplying the ice above what it would have cost if plaintiff had furnished the machinery contracted for would be the measure of damages, provided defendant exercised ordinary care in procuring ice for Kampman.</p>

The assignment is, that there was no pleading or testimony to authorize the charge. The pleading might have been made more definite, but we think the point is sufficiently pleaded to admit testimony thereunder. Without intimating any opinion as to the weight of the testimony, we conclude that it was not improper to submit the issue. There was some testimony that the delay was caused by the attempted use of the Tainter process of producing steam, and that defendant consented to the trial of it. Defendant told Tainter that it would make him a present of $100 if he succeeded with the system. There are some other circumstances in proof which have a tendency to establish the proposition submitted in the charge, which the jury might have considered. It is not our province to determine the effect of the testimony offered; that was for the jury.
