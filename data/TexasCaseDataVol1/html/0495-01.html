It is preventive in character, and is ordinarily at common law used to prevent a court of inferior powers from usurping its jurisdiction in some judicial matter. It is issued by a court of superior jurisdiction to one <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>that is inferior.
