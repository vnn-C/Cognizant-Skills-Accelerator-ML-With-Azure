Proximate Cause — Case in Judgment. — Action by widow for damages for negligently causing the death of her husband. She had sent her two sons to the railway depot to bring their father home, expecting him to arrive as a passenger, intoxicated. The sons were ordered from the depot by the agent in charge. The husband arrived on the train after the boys had left, intoxicated, but knowing what he was doing. He left the train, deposited his baggage, and left the depot. Subsequently he returned, went to sleep upon the track, and was run over by another, a freight train, and killed. In such case it can not be held that the driving of plaintiff’s sons from the depot, preventing them from meeting their father and conducting him home, was the immediate and proximate cause of his death, and that therefore the railway company was liable in damages for his death.</p>

    <p id="b514-7" data-blocks='[["BL_514.8",514,[263,815,1311,1483]]]'>Deceased was about forty years old, a carpenter by trade, earning about $2.25 per day; a strong, robust man, and in good health. He lived with his family at San Marcos, Texas, about 230 or 265 yards from defendant’s depot. He was working at his trade at Kyle, through which defendant’s railway passed, about eight miles northeast of San Marcos. For several nights prior to the 9th of December, 1888, he was expected home as a passenger on defendant’s train. He sometimes drank to excess after his week’s work, when he was paid off, and his wife was expecting him home in an intoxicated condition. She sent her two boys, Martin and Frank, aged respectively 13 and 10 years, to meet him at the train and to conduct him home in case he was drunk. The boys had frequently met him at the train, and had brought him home, and on one occasion he was drunk, ‘ ‘ not very,” he never having refused to go with them. The night of December 9 was cold, and the two boys were at the depot, in the waiting room, where there was a fire, expecting their father on the train due later in the night. The station agent asked them what they were there for. Frank, the older boy, replied that they were there waiting for their father, who was coming on the train from Kyle. He told them that they had been there two or three nights, waiting for him, and that he had not come, and was not coming, and that if they did not leave the depot, and not come around there any more, he would have them arrested and put in jail. His manner and language were rough, and so frightened them that one of them was crying. They were not misbehaving. One of them had been seen about the depot, swinging on the steps of the cars and jumping off while the cars were in motion. They left, and when they got outside, a policeman told them to run on home and come back when they heard the whistle blow. This was 9 or 10 o’clock p. m. They went home and went to sleep, did not hear the whistle, and were not there when their father arrived on the train, between 10 and 11 o’clock on the same night, the 9th of December, 1888.</p>

Witness Johnson went with him to the depot and carried his baggage and assisted him on the train. He was drunk, but not imbecile. He knew what he was doing and where he was going; gave Johnson 25 cents, the <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>exact amount, to purchase him a ticket to San Marcos. He staggered in walking several times, and would have fallen if Johnson had not assisted him. He had a bottle of whisky. In getting on the train he came near falling, and would have done so if Johnson had not caught him. The conductor was looking at him at the time. The steps from the ground were high, and there was no stool, and he had to catch hold of the step rail and pull himself up. The conductor on the train knew his drunken condition. He was helped on to the first seat after entering the car.</p>

Deceased caught hold of Mr. Summerrow, who was with me, and said, ‘ You are not afraid of me, are you ?’ to which Mr. Summerrow replied, ‘No, I am not afraid of you.’ Mr. Summerrow pulled away from him, and we walked on together. Deceased followed us some 10 or 15 steps, and said to us that ‘ we could get all the drink we wanted, that the houses were all open here yet.’ Deceased then turned back toward the depot house, and I and Mr. Summerrow came on up to town. That was the last I saw of the deceased till the 10th of December, 1888. I saw him at his house in San Marcos, dead. He was a stranger to me.”</p>

    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[268,517,1298,87]]]'>The portion of the answer read does not disclose actionable negligence on the part of defendant.</p>
    <p id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.6",518,[266,617,1300,277]]]'>It is the duty of the company to keep lighted, at proper times, its depot, approaches, and other places connected therewith which are likely to be visited by passengers and persons lawfully on the premises; and a negligent omission of this duty, causing injury, would entitle the injured party, without fault on his part, to damages. Bish. on Non-Cont. Law, sec. 1086.</p>
    <p id="b518-7" data-blocks='[["BL_518.7",518,[267,915,1298,127]]]'>But contributory negligence on the part of the person injured might, as before explained, defeat the right of recovery, as in this case we think it did.</p>
    <p id="b518-8" data-blocks='[["BL_518.8",518,[265,1063,1301,485]]]'>There is, however, another ground upon which the averment in defendant’s answer can not be made available in establishing its negligence. It is not shown that lights were needed at the point indicated, for the convenience of any person visiting the depot or for the purpose of moving the trains. It could not be presumed, in the absence of testimony, that a light should be placed so as to discover persons that might be lying in such an unusual place, asleep or drunk. There was no testimony upon the subject, and the allegation does not show the necessity for such a light. Therefore negligence on the part of the company can not be rested upon it.</p>
    <p id="b518-9" data-blocks='[["BL_518.9",518,[266,1560,1300,387]]]'>The evidence was very meagre as to how the accident occurred, outside of the fact that the deceased was lying near the track asleep, in a place of great danger; no evidence that the train men or any of the company’s servants saw him, knew or ought to have known that he was there, or that they were guilty of any negligence causing the injury. All that the evidence shows is, that the occurrence was attributable to the negligence of the deceased, without fault on the part of defendant or its employes, and for which it is not liable.</p>
    <p id="b518-10" data-blocks='[["BL_518.10",518,[266,1958,1299,137]]]'>In such case it was the duty of the court to, instruct the jury to find for defendant. Railway v. Porter, 73 Texas, 307; Railway v. Dean, 76 Texas, 73.</p>
    <p id="b518-11" data-blocks='[["BL_518.11",518,[308,2106,1252,39]]]'>The judgment of the court below should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>
