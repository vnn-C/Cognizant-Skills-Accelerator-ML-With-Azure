In subsequent litigation, the vendee asserting title as a bona fide purchaser against equitable owners of the greater part of the land, upon the issue whether the deed was a quitclaim, held, that it should be construed by the facts attending the transaction — his letters to his vendor, his actual information, his agreement for a quitclaim, the inadequacy in price, etc.</p>

The defendants being innocent purchasers recovered the land, and the plaintiffs showing title against their vendor were entitled to recover of the defendants the unpaid purchase money. They would be liable also upon their payment of the notes after notice of the superior title in the plaintiffs.</p>

February 24, 1887, defendants answered by general demurrer, general denial, and plea of not guilty. September 23, 1887, the court granted leave to defendants to make their warrantor, J. I. Neely, party defendant. February 21, 1888, said Neely appeared and filed an answer, making himself party defendant, and setting up, in substance, that at the time he sold the land in controversy to his codefendants Kramer and Hardt, to-wit, on June 19, 1886, he was possessed of the legal title to it, which he had acquired without any notice of the claim or rights of plaintiffs, and for a valuable consideration; that he sold said lands to defendants Kramer and Hardt for a valuable consideration, and that at no time prior to the filing of this suit did he or they have any notice of the claims or rights of plaintiffs, etc. February 27, 1888, plaintiffs filed their supplemental petition, in which they denied the allegations made by Neely, and averred that he sold said land to his codefendants on a credit, and had not received payment of the price or purchase money therefor, to-wit, the sum of $3800, agreed upon by the defendants; that said sum of $3800 is still due to said defendant (Neely) from his codefendants for said land; that defendants, at the time of their purchase, had notice that said land was held in trust by Mary A. Tate for plaintiffs, who were the owners thereof, and they prayed as in their original petition; ‘and further, in case they may not be entitled to recover said land, then that that they have judgment against said defendants for the unpaid purchase money, and interest thereon; also that they have such other and further relief as their case may require.’ On the 28th of February, 1888, the case was tried by the court, a jury being waived, and judgment was rendered that plaintiffs take nothing of defendants, etc. This judgment was duly excepted to, and notice of appeal given by plaintiffs, and ten days were allowed within which, after adjournment, to make and file statement of facts. Findings of facts and conclusions of law were filed by the court, and a statement of facts was approved and filed on the 8th of March, 1888.”</blockquote>

His position is that of one having notice of all titles. The question is not one of being merely put upon inquiry; the notice is absolute and conclusive as to all claims.</p>

It seems the notes are negotiable promissory notes, but at the time of trial they were still owned and held by Neely. They are not irrevocably bound to pay him these notes, and if they should do so after notice of plaintiffs’ rights, they would not be acquitted of their obligation to pay the true owners at least the amount unpaid at the time of notice. To this extent they would not be innocent purchasers.</p>
