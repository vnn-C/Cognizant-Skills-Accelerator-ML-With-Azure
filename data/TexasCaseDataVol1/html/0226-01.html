      <em>2. </em>Res Adjudicaba. — In 1875 a suit was pending in Rusk County, styled Berry et al. v. Harnage et al., which involved the west quarter of the Reel league, in which league appellant, a minor, at that time had an undivided interest. Two separate pleas of intervention were filed in that suit; one by the Flanagans and the other by the Iveys; the latter being the appellant (represented by a guardian ad litem) and his brothers, adults. By these interventions the north quarter of the league, in which appellant had an interest, was introduced into the litigation, and the trial (at which all the parties were represented) resulted in a judgment settling the title of the west quarter, and a further judgment upon an agreement between the interveners settling their rights in the north quarter and partitioning it between them. <em>Held, </em>the court had jurisdiction of the person of appellant and the subject matter, and the judgment therein was binding on him and a bar to this action, which was for a part of the land partitioned.</p>

Special Guardian — Next Friend. — The law in force in 1875 provided for the appointment of a special guardian to take care of the interests of a minor in a suit pending or about to be commenced. Pasch. Dig., arts. 6969, 6970. Before that statute was passed, and since its repeal, minors could sue by next friend, and there is nothing in those provisions which would prevent a suit or an intervention being brought before the court in that manner. The brothers of the appellant brought him in by their plea of intervention, and if necessary, in the absence of record evidence to the contrary, it would be presumed that in doing so they acted in the capacity of next friend.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b250-12" data-blocks='[["BL_250.13",250,[264,2109,1297,198]]]'>4. Agreement of Guardian. — The fact that the judgment was rendered upon the agreement of the guardian does not render it void. The guardian acted under the supervision of the court, and in a collateral proceeding it must be presumed that the court ascertained the facts upon which the agreement was based, and allowed no wrong done to the minor.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b250-13" data-blocks='[["BL_250.14",250,[268,2314,1294,159]]]'>5.

Collateral Attack. — If by the intervention other land was improperly made a subject of controversy, the action of the court in allowing it might be irregular, but its jurisdiction would not be affected. Whether such a state of facts was shown as to make it proper to bring all the land in or not, the parties were before the court, seeking to litigate over a subject of which it had jurisdiction, and its judgment entertaining and determining their suit can not be collaterally attacked</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[131,605,1297,154]]]'>7. Final Judgment. — The court below has found that the judgment rendered in Berry v. Harnage, as between the intervenors, was a part of the final judgment, and there is no merit in appellant's contention that it was a separate decree.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[130,773,1297,323]]]'>8. Direct Proceeding to Set Aside Judgment. — After the partition judgment was rendered an execution for costs was issued against the Iveys, under which the interest of appellant in the league was sold and one Bagley became the purchaser. He is not a party to this suit, nor do any of the defendants claim under him. None of the parties to the suit of Berry v. Harnage are parties to this, wherefore this case can not be considered a direct proceeding to set aside that judgment, but was correctly treated by the court below as an ordinary action of trespass to try title.</p>

Appellees pleaded various defenses, but one of which need be stated. That was a plea setting up as a bar to this action a former judgment of the District Court of' Rusk County. Appellant in reply to this plea asserted that the judgment was void, for the reasons hereinafter considered. The parties to that judgment were not made parties to this suit, and there was no prayer for reviewing or setting it aside.</p>

    <p id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[131,436,1299,87]]]'>In order to reverse that ruling, it must affirmatively appear to be wrong-from the facts found, for we are without any other means of reviewing it.</p>
    <p id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[132,537,1300,683]]]'>The material facts thus found are: That plaintiff, prior to that judgment, had title to an undivided interest in the land sued for; that in 1875, there was pending in the District Court of Rusk County a suit in which Berry and others were plaintiffs and Ilarnage and others defendants, which involved what is called the west quarter of the Reel league. In that suit, in 1875, two separate pleas of intervention were filed, one by the Flanagans and one by the Iveys. Among the latter were the appellant and his brothers, who were joint owners with him. Appellant at that time was a minor, but several of his brothers who intervened with him were adults, and had employed attorneys to represent them in the intervention. The minutes of the court recite that the intervenors appeared, and that S. R. Whitley was appointed guardian ad litem for plaintiff, and that lie qualified by giving the bond fixed by the court and taking oath as required by law.</p>
    <p id="b253-8" data-blocks='[["BL_253.6",253,[131,1232,1302,583]]]'>It appears by the two interventions that the north quarter of the Reel league, of which the land in controversy is a part, was introduced into the-litigation in that suit. A trial was had at the August Term, 1875, at. which all the parties, plaintiffs, defendants, and intervenors, including plaintiff represented by his guardian ad litem, appeared. A verdict was. rendered as to the matters in issue between the plaintiffs and defendants, and a judgment was rendered thereon settling the title to the west quarter of the league. An agreement was then presented to the court between the intervenors, settling their controversies as to the north quarter, and a judgment was entered in accordance therewith for partition of that pait of the league among the several claimants. Appellee was represented in this agreement and judgment by his guardian ad litem.</p>
    <p id="b253-9" data-blocks='[["BL_253.7",253,[131,1827,1297,285]]]'>After the judgment was rendered an execution for costs issued against the Iveys, and was levied on all their interest in the Reel league. At the sale, N. G-. Bagley, who was their attorney in that suit, bought in the land for $10. It was worth $500 or $600. It does not appear that any of the defendants are claiming under that sale, Bagley’s representatives not being made parties.</p>

The law then in force provided for the appointment of a special guardian to take care of the interests of a minor in a suit pending or about to be commenced, to which such minor was a proper party, such appointment to be made by the court in which the suit was pending or about to be commenced. Pasch. Dig., arts. 6969, 6970.

    <p id="b254-5" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[281,589,1298,334]]]'>The fact that the proceeding was an intervention could not affect the question, for intervenors may occupy the position of either plaintiffs or defendants, and all the elements of a cause of action or ground of defense may be contained in such pleading.
