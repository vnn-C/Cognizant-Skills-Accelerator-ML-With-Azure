Assumed Risk — Fellow Servants. — Plaintiff, an engine wiper, was injured while making a coupling at night, in a switch yard, between a road engine and a coal car, made in obedience to the order of H., who was foreman of the yard, with power to employ and discharge wipers, and who was operating the engine at the time. He backed the engine so hard that plaintiff’s left hand, which held the link, was shoved into the drawhead with the link, and mashed. A switch engine with sloping tender is generally used for yard switching, and plaintiff knew that a road engine was more dangerous, and knew that H. was a machinist and not a regular engineer. <em>Held:</em>

A train was expected in from Conroe on the defendant’s line about 1 o’clock a. m., and the foreman, who went to sleep, had told plaintiff to wake him up when the train came in, which plaintiff did. Housh then told Corley, another engine wiper and night watchman, who was working with plaintiff, to throw the switch, and told plaintiff to couple the switch engine to the coal car, while he got on the engine and backed it up to the coal car, so that plaintiff might make the coupling. Plaintiff testified: “ Housh backed the engine towards the coal car and stopped about five feet from it. I hallooed to him to slow a little more back, and he backed the engine a little further, to about one and a half feet from the coal car, and stopped. I then <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>hallooed to him to come a little more back, and he pulled the throttle open and came back so hard that he caught my left hand, with which I held the link, and shoved it, with the link, into the drawhead of the engine, and mashed it.”</p>

It has a sloping tank, so that one can see over the tender, and is safer to switch with than a road engine. The engine used when the accident occurred was an ordinary road engine.

But the second assignment questions the charge for error in requiring too great care of railway companies in the employment of their servants and furnishing tools and appliances for them to work with. It is as follows: “ The railway company was bound in law to furnish competent and qualified men to handle its engines and trains at the yard at Navas ota, and was also bound in law to furnish means and appliances for switching trains which experienced railway men had found were safest and best adapted for that purpose; and if the company failed or was guilty of negligence in either regard in this paragraph named, and if from and by reason of said negligence injury resulted as a direct and proximate consequence thereof, the railway company is liable.”</p>

Its effect was to instruct the jury that the failure “to furnish competent and qualified men to handle its engines and trains at the yard at Navasota,” and “to furnish means and appliances for switching trains which experienced railway men had found were safest for that purpose,” would be negligence on the part of the company. Such is not the rule, as has been frequently announced in the decisions of our Supreme Court.

In the attempt to make the coupling he assumed the risk of danger, because the defect was open to him. He knew that it was a road engine and that a switch engine was safer than a road engine for the purpose of switching cars.</p>

If this rendered him incompetent, and plaintiff knew it, then he would be charged with knowledge of the danger in attempting to make the coupling with a man in charge of the engine who was not well qualified for the work, and will be held to have assumed the risk. If plaintiff undertook the work with patent and obvious danger, no amount of prudence on his part would relieve him of the risk; and the test is not whether a reasonably prudent man might have undertaken the work, but whether the danger was obvious and apparent, or in fact known to him.

As we have seen, this was error. Again, although Housh may not have been well qualified for the work, and this fact was not known to the plaintiff, no recovery could be had except for negligence in handling the engine. If he handled it carefully and prudently, as an engineer of ordinary care and prudence would have done under the circumstances, then the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, even if the jury should believe that he was not well qualified for the work to be done. This would also apply in case he should be treated as a vice principal or representative of the <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>defendant. Defendant requested instructions limiting its liability to the negligence of Housh, and they should have been given by the court; for, under the charges complained of, the jury may have found for the plaintiff if they believed the danger not so obvious or patent but that a man of ordinary prudence would have undertaken the work, and at the same time have believed that Housh was not guilty of negligence.</p>
    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[272,618,1297,733]]]'>Appellant contends that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and the evidence, in that it shows that plaintiff, before he undertook to make the coupling in connection with Housh acting as engineer, had full knowledge of the fact that Housh was a machinist and not a regular engineer, having had such knowledge for several days or weeks prior to the night of the accident; and plaintiff, in undertaking to work with Housh as engineer under such circumstances, thereby assumed the risk of injury or accident by inability of Housh to properly handle the engine. As the case must be tried again, and the effect of such knowledge having already been determined, we do not deem it necessary to inquire whether or not the facts as shown on the last trial proved such knowledge. For the same reason, we do not pass on the eighteenth assignment, that the evidence shows that Housh was handling the engine with proper care, and the accident could not have been caused by any negligence of Housh, or on account of the road engine being used.</p>

The court erred in charging the jury as follows: Under the facts in this case Housh was not a fellow servant of Schwabbe, but was Schwabbe’s superior, and was the representative of the defendant company; and if Housh directed Schwabbe to make the coupling, and Schwabbe attempted to do so, and while doing so you find that he was injured by the negligence of Housh in handling the car, or was injured by the unfitness and unsuitableness of the engine used, or that he was injured by means of the two forces combined, then the company is liable, unless you find for the company under the instructions hereinafter given.</blockquote>

If the negligence causing the injury is the neglect of a duty which the master owes to his employes, the master is liable, whether the party guilty of the negligence is the master himself or a coemploye to whom he has committed the discharge of such duty; and if a coemploye, such coemploye is, as to the performance of such duty, a vice principal and not a fellow servant; but if the negligence causing the injury is not the neglect of a duty the master owes Ms employes, the master is only liable when he is personally guilty of the negligence, and not when it is the fault of a coemploye of the party injured; for all coemployes, whatever their grade, are fellow servants, except when engaged in the discharge of a duty the master owes'his employes. In other words, the same party may be in some matters a vice principal and in others a mere fellow servant, the test being, that in performing the duties which a master owes to the servant he is a vice principal; in the discharge of all other duties he is a fellow servant.”</p>

    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[175,1091,1302,882]]]'>While we do not assent to the rule as stated in proposition of the appellant above quoted, still a majority of this court is of the opinion, that under the facts of this case Housh was the fellow servant of the plaintiff and not the representative of the company. In handling the engine Housh was not in the performance of any duty which the company owed to the plaintiff, but was engaged in doing an act as the fellow servant of the plaintiff, which, taken in connection with the act to be performed by the plaintiff, would result in switching the coal car from one track to another. Suppose a hostler had been on the engine, it would not be contended that the hostler and the engine wiper were not fellow servants. The only reason for the position that Housh was the representative of the company is, that he, as foreman of the yard, had authority to discharge the plaintiff, and the exercise of an act by him which would ordinarily be the act of a fellow servant is to be regarded as the act of the principal. It occurs to us that the difficulty lies in the failure to separate the individual as the person who handled the engine from himself as the foreman of the yard, charged with duties toward the plaintiff as the representative of the company.</p>
