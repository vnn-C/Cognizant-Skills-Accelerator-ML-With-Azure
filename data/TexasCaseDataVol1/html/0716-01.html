Cross-Examination of Witness. — A plaintiff testified for himself upon a second trial in an action for personal injuries inflicted by a train running upon him when driving a wagon and crossing the track. He made a materially different statement from that made on the former trial as to the distance the train was from the crossing when he noticed its approach. On cross-examination it was reversible error to refuse the following question: “ Have you not made a different statement in your testimony on this trial as to the distance the train was from you when you first saw it, from the statements you made in your testimony on the former trials of this case, by reason of the Supreme Court having reversed the case and you having seen the grounds upon which the case was reversed ?” The witness had admitted having read the opinion of the Supreme Court holding him guilty of contributory negligence upon his own testimony as to the distance the train was from him when he saw it.</p>

The effect of such evidence would be to show the motive of appellee in changing his evidence to be that he was not guilty of the act denounced by the Supreme Court as fatal to his right- of recovery. And it would be a legitimate inference that the jury might consider with other facts in the case that his purpose in testifying differently was to make a case that would meet the objections of the decision rendered in reversing the former judgment. It would be also admissible as a fact or circumstance tending to discredit <a id="p719" href="#p719" data-label="719" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*719</a>the appellee, to be considered by the jury for what it may be worth.
