    <p id="b346-7" data-blocks='[["BL_346.6",346,[282,716,1296,685]]]'>The defendants claimed under several deeds and written 'instruments, claimed to have been executed by deceased ancestors of plaintiffs, and also under verbal locative contracts claimed to have been made by them; and during the trial the defendant Isaac McConnell was used as a witness to prove the execution of the several instruments above referred to, and also the locative contracts. Plaintiffs objected to this witness testifying, on the ground that he was a party to the suit, and could not testify to transactions with their deceased ancestors,' under our statute. To remedy this objection the said McConnell was permitted, after plaintiffs had closed their evidence, to file a disclaimer of all interest in the land in controversy, and the defendant Powell withdrew his pleading seeking to recover over against the said McConnell as his warrantor; but no order was made with reference to the plea of Henry Warren seeking to recover over against said witness.</p>
    <p id="b346-8" data-blocks='[["BL_346.7",346,[281,1411,1295,436]]]'>After these proceedings McConnell was again permitted to testify to substantially the same facts as in his former testimony, and to prove verbal authority from some of the deceased ancestors of plaintiffs to him to locate the certificate by virtue of which the land was patented, and other land certificates, and to give a part of the land to have this done. Appellants objected to this witness testifying to these facts, upon the same grounds urged to his evidence in the first instance. The court, however, overruled these objections, and a number of appellants’ assignments of error are directed to calling in question the correctness of this ruling.</p>
    <p id="b346-9" data-blocks='[["BL_346.8",346,[280,1858,1296,436]]]'>We are of the opinion the court erred in admitting this evidence. Notwithstanding the disclaimer filed by this witness, and the dismissal by the defendant Powell of his plea over against him, we think it can hardly be questioned that the judgment rendered upon this trial would be conclusive against said McConnell in any subsequent suits that might be brought by those claiming under him to recover upon his covenant of warranty; and especially would it be so conclusive against him in favor of the defendant Warren, who had never dismissed his pleading against him.

    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[173,429,1298,823]]]'>Mr. Abbott, in his work on Trial Evidence, page 63, in treating of witnesses who are allowed to testify against executors and administrators, under statutes similar to ours, says: “ No person can be thus examined in his own behalf or interest, or in behalf of a party succeeding to his title or interest, if he or his predecessor in interest is, at the time of the trial, interested in the event of the action or proceeding, whether directly interested in the cause of action, or whether merely liable to be legally affected by the judgment; as, for instance, where he stands in such a position that the effect of a recovery in the action might be to diminish a fund in which he has an interest, or may aid the party unsuccessful in the action to bring and maintain an action against the witness for indemnity.” And again, on page 64: “No person from, through, or under whom such a party or interested person derives his interest or title, by assignment or othewise, can be thus examined in his own behalf or interest, or in behalf of the party succeeding to his title or interest, if the interest or title thus derived is in the particular claim affected by the, transaction or communication.”</p>

    <p id="b347-8" data-blocks='[["BL_347.6",347,[172,1470,1296,385]]]'>In Simpson v. Brotherton, 62 Texas, 170, our Supreme Court, upon full consideration, decided that a wife, by reason of her interest in the community property, was a party to the suit within the meaning of our statute, so as to prohibit her from testifying, although she was not a party to the record; holding that the word “ party ” in this statute was not to be given a narrow construction, but would be extended to include those really in interest, though not parties by name in proceedings; and this was reaffirmed in Newton v. Newton, 77 Texas, 510.</p>
    <p id="b347-9" data-blocks='[["BL_347.7",347,[171,1867,1296,434]]]'>We do not understand the decision in Markham v. Carothers, 47 Texas, 25, and in Eastham v. Roundtree, 56 Texas, 110, to the effect that a defendant who has filed a disclaimer and is thenceforth treated as not being a party to the cause, is a competent witness, as being in conflict with the views here expressed. We therefore hold that where a warrantor has been made a party to the suit in such a way as to render the judgment binding upon him in favor of his vendees, he is a party thereto within the meaning of our statute which prohibits parties from testifying against the heirs or legal representatives of decedents.</p>

    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[272,570,1298,384]]]'>This question has recently been very thoroughly considered by our Supreme Court in the case of Ikard v. Thompson, cited above, and the conclusion reached, that a married woman can make contracts to acquire land by the location of a land certificate, which is her separate property, without acknowledging the same in the manner required for the conveyance of her real estate; and as to the correctness of this decision we do not entertain a.ny question.

We do not understand that the court below based its decision upon this ground, it having in the same connection found that McConnell had express authority from his cotenants to make such a contract. In Stone v. Ellis, 69 Texas, 325, it is expressly decided that one heir has no such implied authority from the other heirs. Also see Grimes v. Smith, 70 Texas, 217, and Sypert v. McCowen, 28 Texas, 640.</p>

In common law courts there would be much in this objection, but as our courts have the power to look to equitable as well as legal titles, the tendency of our decisions has been to hold that such a conveyance would pass whatever right the person making it had to convey, <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>whether it be signed as agent or principal.
