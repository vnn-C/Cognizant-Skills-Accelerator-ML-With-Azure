The foundation for the action, as charged in appellee’s petition, consisted in an unlawful and wrongful ejection of appellee from a train of cars while he was traveling as a passenger from St. Louis, Missouri, to San Antonio, Texas.</p>

To secure this return transportation free, he was required to present his contract at the office of the connecting railroad at St. Louis within twenty days from its date, and there receive a drover’s pass, which he did. The contract in question also contained the following stipulation:</p>

    <p id="b535-9" data-blocks='[["BL_535.8",535,[161,887,1296,527]]]'>Upon this pass and the contract referred to, appellee was allowed to travel free of charge from St. Louis to Texarkana. He was on the Texas <em>&amp; </em>Pacific Railway when he reached the latter place, and the conductor told him that his pass was not good for 90 miles of the road to be traveled immediately after passing Texarkana, and that he would have to pay fare for this 90 miles. This appellee refused to do, and the conductor called in a policeman and compelled him to get off the train at Texarkana after midnight, in the rain, etc. This all occurred on the Texas <em>&amp; </em>Pacific Railway, and not on the International <em>&amp; </em>Great Northern Railroad, which, it was shown, terminated at Longview, a considerable distance from Texarkana.</p>
    <p id="b535-10" data-blocks='[["BL_535.9",535,[161,1434,1299,634]]]'>The trial court instructed the jury, that if they found for the plaintiff, to allow him such actual damages as he was shown by the testimony to have sustained by his unlawful ejection from the train; that this would include such sums of money as he was necessarily compelled to expend in completing his journey to San Antonio, necessary hotel bills, and compensation for loss of time; and that if they found that appellee’s expulsion from the train was not only wrongful, but was accomplished in a rude or insulting manner and under circumstances calculated to mortify and humiliate him, and if in fact he was thereby humiliated and mortified, then the jury might allow him fair and reasonable compensation for the injury done him by reason of the outrage and indignity so inflicted upon him. The charge, however, clearly limited the right of recovery to actual damages.</p>

This injury does not flow from a mere <em>breach </em>of the contract, but arises out of and rests upon the rude and wanton <em>manner </em>in which the contract was broken. The mere failure to comply with the agreement was not a tort, but the wanton and insulting conduct of the conductor at the time was; and it was upon this tort that appellee based and maintained, in the court below, his demand for compensation for wounded feelings.
