Parol Agreement as to Conditions of Purchase of Land. — McCarty and Brackenridge agreed in parol that Brackenridge would furnish McCarty money to buy a house and lot to be used as a homestead, but the deed was to be taken in name of Brackenridge, to hold the land as security and until the money advanced should be paid. The agreement being upon valuable consideration, affected the land; although the deed first taken was executed to McCarty, and by him surrendered and a second obtained from the vendors to Brackenridge, who knew nothing of the first deed.</p>

He wished to buy a homestead, but could not withdraw money wherewith to buy from his business. He agreed with B. that the deed for property paid for with money taken from his business should be executed to B. upon his furnishing money to replace the money so used. Such agreement being executed was upon sufficient consideration.</p>

The court erred in finding that the endorsement made by the plaintiff on the deed from Moore and wife held by him on August 24, 1883, was not a contract between plaintiff and McCarty, but was a voluntary statement in writing made by plaintiff for the protection of McCarty in the event of plaintiff’s death before McCarty got the $2500 as agreed upon to replace the money withdrawn from his business to pay for said property; because the endorsement was placed on the purported deed held by plaintiff long before any money was loaned to the defendant, and states distinctly and without any ambiguity or uncertainty as to intent that McCarty was entitled to a deed to the property whenever he desired it, and that in the meantime the deed could be used as a line of credit in the First National Bank for $2000; all expenses of making deed, acknowledging, etc., to be paid by McCarty. And McCarty being fully informed of this endorsement and its conditions, the deed was ever thereafter held by plaintiff for the purpose and on the terms and conditions contained in this endorsement, and its legal effect can not be contradicted and distorted more than five years after it was made on the ex parte statement of the man who wrote it and signed it.

McCarty assumed the debts, about $17,000, upon dissolution, but McDannell was bound for them. The stock was worth about $22,000. After selling out to McCarty, McDannell says he found out that he was about to buy another place, which would at once become a homestead.

The withdrawal of the money from his business by McCarty, under the circumstances of his agreement with McDannell and the condition of his business., was a sufficient consideration to bind Brackenridge to furnish the money. The agreement to make the mortgage was valid and enforceable; the money was furnished by Brackenridge, a performance that consummated all prior agreements and gave them vitality from the beginning.

The deed was left with plaintiff before the money was drawn, and there was nothing to show the nature of the transaction and McCarty’s interest in the property. Brackenridge did not know of the former deed to McCarty. Brackenridge fully explained the meaning of the endorsement — that it was for McCarty’s protection in case he should die; that McCarty would be entitled to a conveyance of the property from him if he did not draw the money to replace in his business. Evidently the statement that McCarty had deposited with Brackenridge or paid him $2500 was a fiction, but it would afford a consideration and a good reason for a reconveyance of the property to McCarty by Bracken-ridge’s representatives in case of his death. In other words, it indicated that McCarty was entitled to a conveyance unless he used the credit provided for in the memorandum.</p>

The finding is in accord with the testimony. The note was made payable to the bank, but Brackenridge was bound to the bank for the amount, and it was regarded as his obligation by him and the bank authorities. This view of the case is consistent with the facts indicating the very contract with all the parties, and it is so stated by direct testimony. The bank did not loan any money to McCarty.
