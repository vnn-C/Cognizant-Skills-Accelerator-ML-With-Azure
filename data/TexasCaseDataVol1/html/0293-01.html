Appellants also claim that the tax referred to in section 8 was illegal, because the “ outstanding floating indebtedness” therein referred to had been incurred for current expenses, and should be included in the item 1 ‘ current expenses;” and that for current expenses the power of the city is limited to a levy of 25 cents on the $100, already exhausted in section 1.

Hence, the appellees claim, that as Denison was a city of more than 10,000 inhabitants, it was authorized to levy all the taxes included in the ordinance, and this by virtue of article 426 of the Revised Statutes, which is as follows: “ Cities having more than 10,000 inhabitants may levy, assess, and collect such taxes as may be authorized by law, but no tax for any purpose shall ever be levied for any one year which shall exceed 2-¡- per cent of the taxable property of such city.”</p>

This is evident from the organic provisions on this subject, and from the legislation had thereunder. Thus, section 4, article 11, of the Constitution, provides: “ Cities and towns having a population of 10,000 inhabitants or less * * may levy, assess, and collect an annual tax to defray the current expenses-of their local, government, but such tax shall never exceed, for any one year, one-fourth of 1 per cent.”</p>

These duties can not be discharged without money, and to raise money taxation must be resorted to. ‘ ‘ When such a corporation is created, the power of taxation (within the constitutional and charter limit) is vested in it as an essential attribute for all the purposes of its existence, unless its exercise is by express terms prohibited.” United States v.

Since the institution of this proceeding the article in question has been amended by the Act of 1889, limiting the power of taxation of the cities of the character named to one-half of 1 per cent of the taxable property of the city.

These sections were enacted under the act of the Legislature of March 23, 1887. With reference to this act, we deem it sufficient to say that in our opinion it did not operate as a repeal of article 426. It was enacted with reference to the constitutional amendment of 1883, amending section 9, article 8, of the State Constitution. This section in no way impairs the effect of section 5, article 11, above referred to, and of article 426, Revised Statutes, here construed. Lufkin v. Galveston, 63 Texas, 438.</p>
