Shearer filed this suit in the District Court of Tarrant County against the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company. Afterward, on December 6, 1886, Ricker, Lee &amp; Co., a firm of contractors composed of N. H. Ricker, F. L. Lee, and Joe A. Owens, were, by amended petition, made parties defendant. The suit is for the recovery of damages for the loss of an arm and other serious personal injuries charged to have been sustained by plaintiff while in the service of defendants as a brakeman. The injuries are alleged to have occurred April 7, 1886, while defendants were engaged in constructing and operating a line of railway at or near Coleman Junction, in this State, and are ascribed to the negligence of the defendants in permitting the brake beams of one of the cars to be broken, and in permitting the roadbed of defendant’s track to become uneven and remain unballasted.</p>

It filed a cross-bill against Ricker, Lee &amp; Co., alleging that if plaintiff suffered from the negligence of any one, such negligence was chargeable to Ricker, Lee &amp; Co.; and it prayed, if the same should be imputed by operation of law to the defendant company, for judgment against Ricker, Lee &amp; Co.</p>

They also relied upon the general issue, and especially denied their liability to the railway company, alleging that at the time of the injury complained of by plaintiff, the latter was in the exclusive service of the defendant company. A trial, in November, 1887, resulted in a verdict in the sum of $7500 in favor of the plaintiff against the railway company. Ricker, Lee <em>&amp; </em>Co. were discharged.

It was consequently agreed verbally, that the line would be extended by the contractors to Ballinger on the terms and specifications embodied in the written contract, simply substituting places, stations, and lines.

Appellant complains of the action of the court in sustaining this objection. We think that the court was correct. The contract stated the relative duties of the contractors and of the engineer, and the relation of the latter to the former. The interpretation of the witness was but a statement of his opinion or conclusion as to the legal effect of the written contract. This opinion was inadmissible. Purnell v. Gandy, 46 Texas, 191.</p>

An objection on this ground, however, can not be urged for the first time on the trial.
