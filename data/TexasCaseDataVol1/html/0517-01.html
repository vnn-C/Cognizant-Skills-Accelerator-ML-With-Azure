This suit was by the daughter of House by a deceased wife. House had sold the community land in controversy, after the death of his wife, and without administration upon her estate. To prove a settlement by the father with the daughter, defendants were properly allowed to show the chain of title to a tract of land in <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>Ellis County to the father, and deed from the father to the daughter, after the death of his wife, to 200 acres of that land, and sale of the 200 acres of land by the daughter and her husband to a third party.

In such case, the survivor may sell the property for the purpose of discharging community debts; but if he sells without authority, the heirs of the deceased parent would be entitled to recover one-half, less the value of such property as they had received from the surviving parent. The conveyance to the daughter in this case must be held to be prima facie in discharge of such obligation.</p>

Our decisions on the subject are all to the effect, that whenever the heirs of the deceased partner of the marital partnership have received property amounting to their share of the property belonging to the community estate, their equitable title to the remainder stands discharged. We do not think it is a question of estoppel, in which it would be necessary to show fraud on the part of Mrs. Randolph in order to invoke the principle, but it is rather a settlement by the trustee of the legal title with the cestui que trust for her equitable interest therein.</p>

If the doctrine of after-acquired title should be held to be involved, that is now settled in this State against the contention of appellants. Lindsay v. Freeman, 83 Texas, 263. The deed of House to Baker, and the subsequent conveyance by him to appellees’ vendor, was sufficient to connect them with whatever equity House may have acquired.</p>
