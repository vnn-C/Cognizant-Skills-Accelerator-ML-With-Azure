    <p class="headnotes" id="b269-11" data-blocks='[["BL_269.10",269,[130,1525,1299,893]]]'>1. Conditional Deed — Case in Judgment. — Appellee, joined by all his children save L. P. Alford, conveyed to appellants the land sued for, by a deed, the consideration for which, as therein expressed, was the agreement of appellants to care for and support appellee during his natural life, and furnish him with the necessaries and comforts suitable to his age and physical condition, and with clothes to wear; to have and to hold the land forever, upon condition that appellants should faithfully comply with all the stipulations in said agreement, and if said agreement was not complied with the conveyance to be void. A vendor's lien was reserved by appellee on the land to secure the faithful performance of the agreement, and right to live on and use the land during his natural life was also reserved, and at the death of the appellee, if all the provisions of said agreement had been complied with, the land was to become the absolute property of the appellants in fee simple There was evidence showing, breach of the agreement, which was controverted by the appellants. The suit was in the ordinary form of trespass to try title. <em>Held, </em>as to the form of action, there is some difficulty in determining the exact legal effect of the instrument. Its provisions show that an estate upon condition was intended to be created. Some of them indicate that title was not to pass until performance, and others that the estate was to take effect at once. But whether the conditions were precedent or subsequent, if appellants broke their contract before suit was brought the title determined, and right of appellee to recover the property became perfect.</p>

Construction of Deed. — Looking to the purpose of the conveyance, present possession and enjoyment of the land was vested in the grantees, sub<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>ject to the reserved right of the grantor to live on it also, and to have such use of it as was consistent with the rights conferred on the grantees; but the title was never to pass unless at the death of the grantor the agreement had been fully performed.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[278,489,1300,239]]]'>3. Parties to Suit. — All the makers of the deed were <em>not necessary </em>parties. Appellee had only to show title as against appellants. When the deed was made he had title to half the land and the right to occupy all of it during his life as his homestead. If appellants" rights under the deed were at an end. appellee's title was complete, and it was not necessary for him to demand possession or give notice to appellants before he brought suit.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[280,735,1297,76]]]'>4. Improvements. — There being no pleading setting up improvements made in good faith, evidence thereof was properly excluded.</p>
    <p class="headnotes" id="b270-7" data-blocks='[["BL_270.6",270,[279,817,1300,320]]]'>5. Breach of Conditions. — The evidence of the appellee is in several respects indefinite, but if taken as true showed that he was subject to indignities by his son which may have rendered life with him unbearable. The contract contemplated that they should all live together at his own home, and that he should there receive the care and support for which he provided, and mistreatment of him by appellants of such a character as to render life there intolerable would be as much a breach of the agreement as failure to furnish him the necessaries of life.</p>

Appellee testified: that he occupied his old room in the house, using his own furniture; that he ate at the same table with appellants; that the food and cooking were bad; that the coffee was not good and had grounds in it; that no clothes were given him, and that he had to pay for his own washing; that his bed was not properly cared for, and many vermin were allowed to get on it — so many that he could not use it for a month after he left; that on three or four occasions, the details of which he fully gave, appellant E. L. Alford, who was his son, cursed and abused him.</p>
    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[291,779,1295,184]]]'>Appellee was 78 years of age, and his wife had died only a few days before the agreement was made between him and appellants.

    <p id="b272-7" data-blocks='[["BL_272.6",272,[289,1227,1296,187]]]'>Appellants offered to prove that they had made valuable and permanent improvements on the land; which was objected to by appellee, on the ground that no improvements had been pleaded; and the court sustained the objection.

Their position seems to be, that by the deed title to the land vested in them, and that it could not be recovered in such a suit, but that the remedj' upon a breach of the contract was a suit to rescind or cancel the deed.</p>
    <p id="b272-11" data-blocks='[["BL_272.10",272,[283,1972,1299,428]]]'>There is some difficulty in determining the exact legal effect of that instrument. In consideration of the agreement of appellants to care for and support appellee during his natural life, and furnish Mm with the necessaries and comforts suitable to his age and physical condition, and with clothes to wear, it conveys, by its premises, the land to appellants during their natural lives and at their death to their heirs. It then provides, that they shall hold the property to themselves, their heirs, and assigns forever, upon condition that they shall comply with their agreement.</p>

    <p id="b273-6" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[159,718,1299,185]]]'>It is not very material to the present inquiry to which class of conditions the one in question belongs. Whether it was precedent or subsequent, the failure of appellants to perform it defeated their right to the property.</p>
    <p id="b273-7" data-blocks='[["BL_273.6",273,[159,916,1300,336]]]'>Looking to the purpose of the conveyance, we think the intention was to vest in the grantees the present possession and enjoyment of the land, subject to the reserved right of the grantor to live on it also, and have such use of it as was consistent with the right conferred on the grantees, and was proper to enable them to care for, support, and maintain Mm there, as agreed upon; but that the title was never to pass unless at the death of the grantor the agreement had been fully performed.</p>

    <p id="b273-9" data-blocks='[["BL_273.8",273,[160,1413,1300,286]]]'>This would be the case also if the title vested subject to the condition to be thereafter fulfilled. Tied, on Real Prop., sec. 277. It follows from this, that in either view of the instrument, if appellants had broken their contract before the suit was brought, the title which appellee conveyed to them was determined, and Ms right to recover the property became perfect.</p>
    <p id="b273-10" data-blocks='[["BL_273.9",273,[160,1709,1306,436]]]'>This virtually disposes of the second point made by appellants, that all the makers of the deed were necessary parties to the suit. All that was required of appellee was to show title to the property as against appellants. He had the title when he made the deed, for one-half of the land belonged to him absolutely, and he had the right to occupy all" of'it dur-o ing his lifetime as his homestead. If, therefore, appellants’ rights under the deed were at an end, Ms title was complete. For this reason' also it was not necessary for Mm to demand possession or give notice to appellants before he brought suit. Tied, on Real. Prop., sec. 277.</p>

On several points it is quite indefinite. In what respects and to what extent the food and drink were bad is not explained, nor whether or not the neglect of appellee was common or habitual. While there is evidence that no <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>clothing was furnished him, and that he had to pay for his own washing, it is not shown that he needed more clothing than he had, nor that he ever asked that appellants either furnish it to him or pay his laundry bills-His evidence, however, does, if taken as true, show that he was subjected to indignities by his son, which may have rendered it unbearable for him, with proper self-respect, to continue to live with appellants. The contract contemplated that they should all live together at his old home, and that he should there receive the care and support for which he provided.</p>

This evidence, together with the testimony as to the personal discomforts he was allowed to suffer while living with appellants, was sufficient to support the finding of the jury. The question was submitted to the jury by a charge which was fair to both sides, and we can not, consistently with settled rules, disturb their verdict.</p>
