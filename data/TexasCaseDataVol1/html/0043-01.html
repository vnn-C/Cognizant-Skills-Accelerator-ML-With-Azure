Sidewalk Assessments — Liability of Homestead. — The city of Beaumont, under the authority of articles 375 and 376, Bevised Statutes, passed an ordinance providing that the cost of constructing any sidewalk in the city should be defrayed by the owner of the abutting lot, and gave him the right to make it; but if he failed to do so, the city should construct it and assess the cost thereof against such abutting owner, and such assessment should become a lien for the amount thereof against the property of such owner, and might be enforced in any court having jurisdiction, by suit and foreclosure. Such a suit (in all respects regular) having been brought and judgment of foreclosure had, and sale of appellees’ homestead made thereunder for the sum of $27.50, <em>held: It is no longer </em>an open question in this State that local assessments for pavements or sidewalks, when imposed by a city according to law upon the abutting property, are special taxes, for which the homestead may be subject to forced sale.</p>

It can not be shown, to avoid the effect of such judgments, that the taxes were previously paid or the assessment illegal and void.</p>

The passage of the ordinance by the city of Beaumont, under which the suit to foreclose the tax lien was instituted, was authorized by this section. Articles 474, 475, 476, 477, Revised Statutes, relate to avenues, streets, and alleys exclusively, and examination of articles 375 and 376 in connection with those relating to avenues, streets, and alleys, will show that they are treated as separate and distinct.

In this case it appears that the appellees were duly notified to construct the sidewalk in front of their lot; but failing to do so, the city then erected the same. Upon the failure of the appellees to pay the costs of the sidewalk as erected by the city, the latter filed its suit in the District Court of the county by a petition, which seems to contain all of the essential averments to give the court jurisdiction and to authorize the foreclosure of the lien claimed by the city upon the property in that case. All of the facts and proceedings were duly alleged, and each of the appellees was duly cited by personal service, as provided by law in any ordinary civil suit, to appear and defend the action. They made default, and the District Court gave judgment against them and in favor of the city, foreclosing the lien upon the part of the lot owned by the defendants, and directed it to be sold as under execution to satisfy the amount of $20 (which the court found to be due the city), and the costs of the proceeding.

It is no longer an open question in this State, that local assessments for pavements or sidewalks, or other improvements of a similar character, when imposed and levied by a city, according to law, upon the abutting property, are special taxes for which the homestead may be sold as other lands in the mode which may be provided by law.</p>
    <p id="b73-5" data-blocks='[["BL_73.4",73,[142,585,1297,683]]]'>The homestead may be subjected to forced sale under the Constitution for taxes due thereon, and it has been several times decided by the Supreme Court that those local assessments, if regularly laid, will create a lien upon even the homestead, of which the District Court, under the Constitution, has ample jurisdiction, and may foreclose the same. We bow to these decisions, and hold that the homestead of the appellees was not protected b)r the Constitution from these taxes, or assessments. Lufkin v. Galveston, 58 Texas, 549; Wood v.

The ordinance, among other things, provided that the sidewalks should be constructed of “ brick, stone, or wood, or such other material as may be designated by the committee on bridges and streets, the committee to be composed of three aldermen, and to be appointed by the mayor.” This, it is claimed, was a delegation by the common council of a part of its legislative power and control over the subject to others, and in violation of law. Perhaps this position is entirely correct, and it seems to be supported by authority. Thompson v. Schermerhorn, 6 N. Y. App., 92. Still, if the question were before us in such way that we would be required to decide it, we might hold, that after rejecting this provision of the ordinance, enough would remain to accomplish the purpose of the act, and to justify its execution.

    <blockquote id="b80-12" data-blocks='[["BL_80.13",80,[272,1664,1306,635]]]'>“Article 376. To establish, erect, construct, regulate, and keep in repair bridges, culverts and sewers, sidewalks and crossings, and to regu-' late the construction and use of the same, and to abate and punish any obstruction or encroachments thereon; and the cost of the construction of sidewalks shall be defrayed by the owner of the lot or part of the lot or block fronting on the sidewalk; and the cost of any sidewalk constructed by the city shall be collected, if necessary, by the sale of the lot or part of the lot or block on which it fronts, together with the cost of collection, in such a manner as the city council may by ordinance provide; and a sale of any lot or part of lot or block to enforce collection of. costs of sidewalks shall convey a good title to the purchaser, and the balance of proceeds of sale, after paying the amount due the city and costs of sale, shall be paid by the city to the owner.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b80-13" data-blocks='[["BL_80.14",80,[275,2311,1293,90]]]'>An ordinance was passed by the city council providing for the construction of sidewalks, which, among other things, provided:</p>
    <blockquote id="b80-14" data-blocks='[["BL_80.15",80,[276,2412,1294,89]],["BL_81.1",81,[168,329,1301,188]]]'>“ The cost of the construction of said sidewalks shall be a lien in favor of the city for the amount thereof on the property of such owner, and <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>said lien shall exist in favor of the city for such costs, and shall be by the city enforced in any court having jurisdiction of the subject matter of a suit brought for the purpose, and said property sold according to law to pay the cost of such construction, besides the cost of suit.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[169,527,1300,239]]]'>Article 376 of the Revised Statutes made the assessment a lien upon the lot, and we think that the power conferred by it to collect the cost of construction by a sale of the lot in such manner as the city council might by ordinance provide, was sufficient to authorize the passage of the ordinance providing for the sale by process of a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[170,776,1300,436]]]'>The conclusion reached by the Supreme Court was evidently based upon a construction of articles 474, 475, 476, and 477 of the Revised Statutes. These articles relate to avenues, streets, and alleys exclusively; and while it may be said that the sidewalk is a part of the street, still an examination of articles 375 and 376, in connection with those relating to avenues, streets, and alleys, will, as we think, conclusively show that they are treated as distinct and separate. For the construction of a sidewalk the lot may be charged with the entire cost, but it can be charged with only one-third of the cost of the paving and repair of the street.</p>
    <p id="b81-7" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[171,1224,1299,383]]]'>Article 446 relates to the method of sale for taxes. It is general, but it is the method of sale provided for in article 476 by its language directing the sale in the manner “ provided by ordinance for the sale of real estate in the city, charged with the payment of taxes imposed by said corporation.” The method of sale, however, for the cost of the construction of a sidewalk is a special provision which will control the general provision in article 446, if, indeed, that provision should be more than the method prescribed for the collection of ad valorem taxes.</p>

Heard, 54 Texas, 420, the suit was by the city against Heard to recover a sidewalk assessment made under a provision of the charter of Galveston identical with article 376, and to have the property sold to satisfy the lien of the assessment. The right of the city to proceed by a suit in the District Court to establish a lien and have the property sold does not seem to have been questioned, but that is what was done by the court.</p>
    <p id="b81-9" data-blocks='[["BL_81.8",81,[174,1965,1296,237]]]'>Article 376 is a special and independent provision of the charter relating to the construction of sidewalks, and it is not in any manner controlled by the articles 474, 475, 476, and 477, relating to avenues, streets, and alleys; nor is it controlled as to the manner of sale by article 446, relating to- the sale of real estate for the taxes assessed thereon.</p>
