        "text": "COLLARD, Associate Justice.\nThis action was brought by the appellee, William Johnston, against Guadalupe County, the appellant, for specific performance of a contract, by which it is claimed that the county was to purchase plaintiff\u2019s farm of 271 acres of land for a poor farm, and to pay him $6000 therefor, and' also for damages for breach of the contract. Before the trial closed plaintiff abandoned his claim for damages, and relied only upon his right to specific performance.\nDefendant filed a general demurrer and special exceptions to the petition, which were overruled. It also filed a general denial and special answers.\nThe trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff for specific performance, and for $6000, from which defendant has appealed, and assigns errors, two of which are as follows:\n\u201c The court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s general demurrer to the petition herein, in that the petition does not state facts sufficient to entitle plaintiff to decree for specific performance.\u201d\n\u201cThe court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s third special exception to the petition, to the effect that tlie petition alleges that the Commissioners Court, on the 13tli day of October, 1888, made and entered of record the order of which the paper thereto attached and marked exhibit 1B \u2019 is a copy, and does not allege the tenor, contents, or effect of said order, and thus attempts to make an exhibit supply material averments to the petition, in contravention of the rules of pleadings prescribed for the court.\u201d\nThe petition relating to specific performance is as follows:\n\u201c That heretofore, to-wit, at the-term of the County Commissioners Court of Guadalupe County, he entered into an agreement with the County of Guadalupe, said county acting through and by the said Commissioners Court, to sell to said county the tract of land described in the deed hereto attached as a part of this petition, marked \u2018A.\u2019 That said county, through said court, had previously advertised for property and prices for the purpose of establishing a poor farm, or place to keep and take care of the paupers of the county, and in' obedience to said advertisement petitioner placed his property at the disposal of said county at the sum of $6000, being the property described in said deed; and thereupon said Commissioners Court, on the 13th day of October, 1888, made and entered of record the order of which the paper hereto attached marked 1 B\u2019 is a copy. That the proposal of petitioner was made in writing. Thereupon, and being induced thereto by said order \u2018 B \u2019 and the offer of acceptance by said county, through said court, petitioner purchased a 40-foot road, in all respects complying with the requirements of said order and acceptance, for which he paid the sum of $300; that on procuring said road, petitioner presented a deed from the owner of the land over which said road runs, and a deed from petitioner for said land, said deed being exhibit \u2018A,\u2019 and demanded a fulfillment of said contract and pay for his property, according to contract; whereupon said Commissioners Court, acting on behalf and for said county, refused to accept said deeds and pay for said property, for no other or better reason than that said contract was distasteful to some persons, and subjected said commissioners to some adverse criticism. Petitioner alleges that he has in all things complied with the letter and spirit of said contract. That on the faith thereof, and relying upon the good faith of said Commissioners Court, he purchased said roadway at a cost of $300, for which petitioner has no other use than to comply with his said contract. That said roadway would not have been purchased except to comply with said contract, and said Commissioners Court and Guadalupe County was aware of the fact when said executory contract was made, that if petitioner furnished a road so as to enable him to comply with said contract, that he would have to purchase the same.\u201d\nPrayer for enforcement of the contract.\nExhibit \u201cA\u201d is a general warranty deed by plaintiff and his wife to the county for 271 acres of land, acknowledged in due form, deed dated November 15, 1888.\nExhibit \u201c B\u201d is as follows:\n\u201c Saturday, October 13, 1888.\n\u201c Court met pursuant to adjournment. County judge and all the commissioners present, and proceeded to business.\n\u201c In the matter of purchasing a farm for a poor farm:\n\u201cMotion was made by J. N. Bishop, and seconded by R. D. McGee, to accept Wm. H. Johnston\u2019s bid, upon the condition that he furnished a 40-foot open road from his northwest corner to the Seguin and Gonzales road, on suitable ground; which motion being put to a vote, was carried. J. N. Bishop and R. D. McGee voting yea; F. C. Weinert and F. M. Beyer voting nay. There being a tie vote, the county judge decided the motion by voting yea.\n\u201cIt is further ordered that W. H. Johnston have until November term of the court to accept.\u2019 \u2019\nThe general demurrer and special exception should have been sustained. No legal liability on the part of the county is alleged. It is not enough to state that a contract was made, as shown in the exhibit, but the legal obligations created by the contract should have been set forth by appropriate averments. Exhibit \u201c B\u201d may be evidence of a contract, but its terms can not take the place of allegations of its legal effect. The pleader must make \u201c a full and clear statement of the cause of action, and such other allegations pertinent to the cause as plaintiff may deem necessary to sustain his suit.\u201d A historical statement of the transactions between the parties is not such a statement. The legal import of the transactions and the undertakings imposed must be stated, as well as the failure to perform them. The allegation of performance on the part of plaintiff, and the failure of performance on the part of defendant, may be sufficiently stated, if it had been shown what was required to be performed.\nDelivered December 21, 1892.\nWe are compelled to hold that both the above assignments of error should be sustained. Dist. Ct. Rule 19; Macdonell v. Railway, 60 Texas, 594; Jones v. Jones, 49 Texas, 690; Holman v. Criswell, 13 Texas, 38; Whitaker v. Record, 25 Texas Supp., 382; Crawford v.

Mundine, 24 Texas, 283; Younger v. Welch, 22 Texas, 418; 15 Texas, 179; 5 Texas, 585; 15 Texas, 403.\nThe necessary allegations omitted are not supplied by defendant\u2019s answer nor by plaintiff\u2019s supplemental petition in reply thereto.\nThis being the condition of the ease, we are not required to consider other assignments of error claimed to have occurred on the trial.\nThe judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered.\nReversed and remanded.",
