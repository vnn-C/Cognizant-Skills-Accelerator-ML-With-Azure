"TARLTON, Chief Justice. October 11, 1888, the appellants, J. F. Henry, Jim Langston, and S. C. Padelford, as executors of the will of F. M. Sansom, deceased, brought this suit in the District Court of Johnson County, against the appellees, D. F. Sansom, J. G-. D. Boyd, M. Sansom, and A. J. Brown. The plaintiffs sought to recover the amount of a promissory note for the sum of $6347.43, with interest at 12 per cent per annum from date, executed by appellees to F. M. Sansom, since deceased, dated August 23, 1886, and maturing August 23, 1888. The plaintiffs prosecute this appeal from a verdict and judgment dated December 28, 1889, reducing the amount of the note to $5594.70, with 12 per cent interest from date of the judgment. Our conclusions of fact are as follows: 1. August 23, 1886, D. F. Sansom executed and delivered to his uncle, F. M. Sansom, two certain promissory notes; one for $6391.02, with interest at 12 per cent, due one year from date; the other for the sum of $6347.43, with interest at 12 per cent, due two years from date. The former note was executed by D. F. Sansom, J. G-. D. Boyd, M. Sansom, and G-. W. Cotter The latter, which is the note sued on, was made by D. F. Sansom, J. Gr. D. Boyd, M. Sansom, and A. J. Brown. D. F. Sansom was the principal on these notes; the remaining persons were sureties. 2. F. M. Sansom, payee in these notes, died in the fall of 1886, and the appellants herein were duly appointed executors of his will. 3. The true and valid consideration for the foregoing two notes, as contended by appellees, was a pre-existing indebtedness aggregating at the date of their execution about the sum of $10,476. This indebtedness was evidenced, as they contend, by two promissory notes; one for the sum of $8778, dated March 1, 1885, and due March 1, 1886, with 12 per cent interest from date; the other for $150, with similar interest, dated January 1, 1886, due October 1, 1886. Appellees introduced evidence in support of this contention. 4. The consideration for the two notes first referred to, as appellants contend, was a pre-existing indebtedness evidenced by the note for $8778, already mentioned, and by an account for the sum of $3400, with 12 per cent interest, due by D. F. Sansom to F. M. Sansom on a contract and as purchase money for certain stock sold by the latter to the former. The note for $150, referred to by appellees, entered, as appellants contend, in no way into the transaction. Appellants introduced evidence in support of this contention. 5. According to appellees, the two notes executed exceeded the true indebtedness by about $2262.32. According to appellants, the true indebtedness exceeded the amount of the notes by $1494.20. 6. October 6, 1887, in the District Court of Johnson County, the appellants herein as plaintiffs, and as executors of F. M. Sansom, deceased,, brought suit against D. F. Sansom, J. G. D. Boyd, M. Sansom, and G. W. Cotter, to recover the amount of the note first maturing for the sum of $6391.02, with interest as therein stipulated. The defendants named appeared in that suit, and filed an agreement in writing, consenting that the court should render judgment against them for the entire amount of the note, principal and interest. June 11, 1888, judgment was rendered embodying this agreement, and reciting that since the institution of the-suit the defendants had paid on the note the sum of $7000, and it decreed a recovery against the defendants for the remainder, $337.09, with interest at 12 per cent per annum from the date of judgment. The remainder thus adjudged was subsequently paid by the defendant D. F.. Sansom. 7. After the note for $150 matured, the executors of F. M. Sansom. brought suit thereon and recovered judgment. In that suit the defendant D. F. Sansom pleaded in writing that the note sued on had been merged into the two notes executed August 23, 1886, and had been thereby settled, and evidenced no indebtedness against him. The defendant D. F. Sansom urged two special defenses, by both of which he sought, and by one of which, at least, he obtained, a reduction of the note sued upon. These defenses were: 1. That the notes executed August 23, 1886, including the note in controversy, were in excess of the indebtedness which constituted the consideration for them, and that this excess was due to the mutual mistake of himself and of the payee, F. M. Sansom. 2. The plea of usury. In response to the first special plea, the court instructed the jury as follows: “ If you believe from the evidence that the note sued on and the note for the sum of $6391.02 heretofore sued on and paid, off, as shown by the evidence, was given in settlement of an indebtedness due by defendant D. F. Sansom to F. M. Sansom, deceased, and that by mutual mistake said two notes were executed for a greater sum than D. F. Sansom owed F. M. Sansom, then you will find what sum D. F. Sansom did owe F. M. Sansom, and you will calculate interest at 12 per cent per annum thereon from the date of the execution of said two notes up to the present time, and add said interest to the sum you find D. F. Sansom owed F. M. Sansom; and you will calculate interest at 12 per cent per annum upon the note sued on up to the present time, add the same to the face value of the said note, and add the amount of the sum paid on the note of $6391.02, upon which there was a judgment, and from the amount so obtained deduct the amount from the sum you shall find, if any, due by D. F. Sansom to F. M. Sansom, and render your verdict for the remainder, if any.” We are constrained to hold that this instruction, the giving of which appellants assign as error, fails to meet the purpose of .every charge, namely, to afford the jury the means of applying the law pertinent to the facts about which they are to deliberate and which it is their exclusive province to weigh. In the process of subtraction directed in the concluding clause of the instruction, it is difficult, if not impossible, to infer from the language used what sum was to be regarded as the subtrahend within the meaning of the charge. This confusion doubtless arises on account of a clerical mistake in framing the instruction. The effect, however, is not thereby changed. The jury were left without guidance in their deliberations with reference to this plea of mutual mistake, and if they sought to interpret the charge they were probably misled thereby. We are unable to say, so great was the conflict in the testimony with reference to the main transaction out of which this controversy grows, that this error was not prejudicial to the plaintiffs. On the defendant’s plea of usury, the court instructed the jury as follows: “ If you believe that defendants were charged on said note (sued on), or that there was included in said note, interest at a greater rate than 12 per cent per annum, then you will ascertain from the evidence what rate of interest was charged per annum or included in the note sued on; and if you find from the evidence that any interest greater than 12 per cent per annum was included in said note sued on, you will in such event, if you so find, deduct from the amount of the face of the notes the amount of interest over 12 per cent per annum so included, if any, and find for plaintiffs the remainder, without interest.” Appellants complain of this instruction for the reason, in effect, that it was not justified by the plea of the defendants seeking to set up the defense of usury; that while said plea purported in name to be a plea of usury, it in fact was not such a plea, because the facts therein alleged indicate that F. M. Sansom was not a party to the contract to pay usury. The allegations of the plea are, substantially, that at the time of the execution of the two notes of $6347.43 and $6391.02, the calculation of the amount of the indebtedness for which they were substituted was entrusted by F. M. Sansom, who was then very ill, to another person; that the interest charged as usurious was inserted in the notes by the person thus entrusted; that when F. M. Sansom was informed of the excessive interest inserted he “ declared the same to be wrong, and stated that when said notes for $6347.43 and $6391.02 came to be paid and settled, he desired them to be corrected and settled by reference to the notes of defendant for which they were given, and which were at that time inaccessible because sealed up and deposited in a bank at Alvarado, and that defendants should be charged only 12 per cent interest per annum on what was at that time actually due him, as shown by said notes then in said bank;” and that relying solely on said assurance, the defendant D. F. Sansom signed the two notes. It has been held, “ that in construing the usury laws the uniform construction in England has been, and it is equally applicable here, that to constitute usury within the prohibitions of the law there must be an intention knowingly to contract for or to take usurious interest.” Call v. Palmer, 116 U. S., 98; Jones v. Berryhill, 25 Iowa, 289. The allegations of the plea, as we interpret them, exclude the idea that F. M. Sansom was a party to a contract of usury. To state that he should be deemed guilty of violating the law with reference to usury in the face of a repudiation by him of the insertion in the notes of illegal interest, and a positive instruction by him that the maker of the notes should not be held liable for such interest, is, in our opinion, to state a contradiction. A contract, legal or illegal, can not exist in the absence of assent by both parties thereto. Appellants’ brief requires that we consider a remaining question, viz.: Will appellees be permitted to dedúet from the note sued on such usurious interest as entered into the note for the sum of $6391.02 first maturing? As we have already seen, the latter note, principal and interest, was reduced to judgment against the appellee D. F. Sansom and others by and with their consent, and this judgment was by him discharged and paid off. It is settled in this State, that usurious interest voluntarily paid may be recovered, and that it may become the subject matter of a counterclaim in a subsequent proceeding on a different indebtedness against the party paying it. Building & Loan Assn. v. Robinson, 78 Texas, 163; Smith v. Stevens, 81 Texas, 461. Where, however, such usurious interest has been collected by virtue of a legal proceeding, in which the defense of usury might have been but was not urged, it must be deemed to have been forever placed beyond the pale of litigation. The judgment is conclusive against a subsequent plea of usury. Moseley v. Smith, 21 Texas, 441; Black on Judg., 759; Herm. on Estop., 47; Heath v. Frackelton, 20 Wis., 320; Traxel v. Clark, 9 Iowa, 201; Miller v. Clark, 37 Iowa, 325; Togood v. Elliott, 32 Iowa, 543. We find no error in the action of the court complained of in appellants’ brief with reference to the admission and exclusion of evidence. We deem it unnecessary to discuss other assignments relied upon by appellants. For the errors pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded. Reversed cmd remanded. Delivered January 24, 1893.","J. F. Henry et al. v. D. F. Sansom et al. No. 45. 1. Charge of Court.—The purpose of the charge of the court is to afford the jury the means of applying the law pertinent to the facts about which they are to deliberate, and which it is their exclusive province to weigh. A charge which is confusing and leaves the jury without guidance in their deliberations with reference to a material and disputed issue in the case constitutes reversible error. 2. Usury—Insufficient Plea.—To constitute usury within the prohibition of the law there must be an intention knowingly to contract for or to take usurious interest. A plea of usury is not good which alleges that the payee of the note sued on requested a third person to calculate the indebtedness due him by the maker, and draw up anote therefor, and that such third person included usurious interest therein without the knowledge or assent of the payee, who, when informed of it after the note was signed, declared it was wrong, and that he desired the note settled for the true amount due him, with lawful interest only. 3. Usury—Judgment Conclusive Against Subsequent Plea of.— Usurious interest voluntarily paid may be recovered, or may be offset against another debt between the parties. But when it has been collected by virtue of a legal proceeding in which the defense of usury might have been but was not urged, the judgment in such case is conclusive against a subsequent plea setting ■up such usury in offset against another debt due the judgment creditor. Appeal from Johnson. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. W. Poindexter, for appellants. 1. Usury included in the judgment on the former note could not be pleaded in this suit, and the court erred in its charge on this point. Frank v. Morris, 11 Am. Rep., 4; Hannas v. Hawk, 24 N. J.

Stone, 59 Texas, 612; Johnson v. Blount, 48 Texas, 38; Hardy v. DeLeon, 5 Texas, 211. 2. The charge of the court fairly submitted the issue of mistake to the jury, and contained all proper and necessary directions to the jury, in the event they found there was a material mistake, to enable them to find a correct verdict; and the verdict found is correct and meets the justice of the case.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. The land in controversy in this suit, consisting of a tract of 642 acres and a tract of 3337 acres, situated in Wichita County, was patented in the month of August, 1884, in the name of M. M. Purinton, as assignee of Bonato Leona. These patents were issued by virtue of a duplicate certificate for a league and labor of land, issued in the name of said Bonato Leona by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, Becember 4, 1874, in lieu of headright certificate alleged to have been issued to said Bonato Leona by the Board of Land Commissioners of Nacogdoches County, March 24, 1838. The duplicate certificate was issued upon a showing made of the loss of the original by S. H. Cooper, through his attorney in fact, G. W. Biamond, under a purported conveyance of this original certificate from Bonato Leona to said Cooper, of date of January 3,1848, and recorded in 1883. In the year 1875 the duplicate certificate was located on the land in controversy. By deed dated October 4, 1883, said Biamond, under power of attorney from Cooper of about the same date, conveyed the land to M. M. Purinton. Bonato Leona lived in Nacogdoches County from 1834 to 1838, and died in 1839. It is manifest that the purported conveyance from Bonato Leona to Cooper was a forgery. In March, 1878, prior to the issuance of said patents, Gunter & Mun-son located valid land certificates on the larger of the two tracts of land in controversy. Their location, in conflict with said larger survey, consisted of three sections of land of 640 acres each, numbered 7, 8, and 9, of which No. 8 was located for the State; and at the same time they located for the State also survey No. 10. In July, 1890, J. N. Lee, claiming in right of the heirs of Donato Leona, instituted a suit to recover the lands in controversy of those claiming under the patent to M. M. Purinton, including Meade & Bomar. In February, 1891, Gunter & Munson instituted a suit against Meade & Bomar to recover so much of the larger tract of land in controversy as was covered by their location. These two suits were consolidated, and the State of Texas intervened, claiming the land not covered by the odd sections of Gunter & Munson, and asking to have the patents issued to Purinton cancelled. The cause was tried without a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of the State, cancelling said patents, and in favor of Gunter & Munson for the recovery of the land claimed by them, from which judgment the other parties have appealed. The record contains no conclusions of law and fact, but the trial court must have found that there never was- in existence an original headright certificate to Donato Leona for a league and labor of land in lieu of which the duplicate certificate was issued. After a careful consideration of the facts contained in the record, we conclude that the preponderance of the evidence sustains this finding. It appears from the evidence, however, that there was an original certificate issued March 27, 1838, by the Board of Land Commissioners of Nacogdoches County, to John L. Roberts and George Allen, assignees of Donato Leona, for one labor of land, which was approved as a valid certificate to Donato Leona for one labor of land, by the Board of Land Commissioners appointed to detect fraudulent land certificates under the law of 1840. It appears also that the Mexican government granted to Donato Leona a league of land as a colonist, located in Angelina County, in the year 1834. In the year 1889, Meade & Bomar instituted suit -against Gunter & Munson to remove cloud from their title to 1322^ acres of the larger tract in controversy, alleging, as one ground for relief, that they had acquired title under the three years statute of limitations. In that suit the trial court found that they had not had such continuous possession as would sustain their plea under the three years limitation, but found that they were innocent purchasers and entitled to recover against Gunter & Munson. The Supreme Court, in October, 1890, on appeal from this judgment, held that Meade & Bomar showed no such title as to warrant a judgment in their favor, and reversed and rendered judgment for Gunter & Munson. Section No. 7 of the Gunter & Munson location was involved in that suit. The statement of facts in this record contains an admission that upon the trial of said suit proof on the question of limitation of three years was introduced pro and con by both parties, and passed upon by the court in favor of Gunter & Munson, and that Meade & Bomar introduced the patent and their claim of title thereunder as shown in this case. It was also admitted that Meade & Bomar and those under whom they claimed had been in peaceable, adverse, and exclusive possession of said 1322 acres of the larger tract in controversy, cultivating, using, and enjoying the same, and paying taxes as they accrued, since May 5, 1885; and that M. M. Purinton entered into the possession of the balance of the larger tract on May 15, 1886, and that she and the defendants claiming under her had been in the actual, adverse, and exclusive possession thereof ever since, paying taxes thereon regularly as they accrued. It was neither proven nor admitted that the possession of any of the parties was held under deeds duly registered. It was further admitted that Meade & Bomar bought the 1322 acres of land claimed by them, and paid value therefor, without any notice of defect in title, and that A. J. Roberts bought in the same way. In the case of Gunter & Munson v. Meade & Bomar, 78 Texas, 634, it is held, that inasmuch as a duplicate certificate professes to confer no rights other than such as the original gave, if there be no original it confers no right whatever. This decision rests upon a finding by the trial court in that case (which was sustained by the Supreme Court) that the records of the General Land Office did not show that any original certificate for a league and labor of land had ever been issued by the Board of Land Commissioners for Nacogdoches County to Donato Leona, but that a colonist’s grant for one league of. land had been made to him by the government in 1835, which was situated in Angelina County, and that that board issued to the assignees of Leona a certificate for one labor of land. It follows from the conclusions of fact set forth above and the law as announced in that case, that J. N. Lee, who is admitted to have such rights as the heirs of Donato Leona would be entitled to maintain in this suit, can not recover, against Gunter & Munson and the State of Texas, the land sued for by him. It also follows, as we think, that the other parties to the suit who claim under the patent to M. M. Purinton can not successfully resist a recovery herein of the land sued for by the State; nor can they prevent a recovery by Gunter & Munson unless the defense interposed under the statutes of limitation can avail them. The five years statute can not be invoked, because the record contains no proof that they held under deed or deeds duly registered. It is contended by counsel for Gunter & Munson that the three years clause can not avail Meade & Bomar as to section No. 7, because the decision in the former suit of Meade & Bomar v. Gunter & Munson precludes this defense as being res adjudicata. We are of opinion that this contention can not be sustained. This record discloses that, on the former trial, proof was introduced pro and con.as to the possession, but does not show what that proof was, nor that it was identical with the proof upon the last trial. This issue on the former trial was determined against Meade & Bomar, because the proof failed to show at that time a sufficient continuous possession. It is admitted in the statement of facts that on the last trial a possession of the requisite character was held by Meade & Bomar and those under whom they claimed, from May 5, 1885, up to that time. We have, however, reached the conclusion, that under the construction placed upon the three years statute of limitations by our Supreme Court, inasmuch as possession is held under a grant void for want of power in the officer issuing it, none of the defendants in this case can avail themselves of this defense. While the decided cases establish the rule that the three years clause of the statute of limitations is applicable where the patent purports to pass the legal title, and does pass all the title the State has or can convey, though in fact no title passes to the grantee; yet a proper observance of the distinctions made in these and analogous cases seems to us to lead to the conclusion, that where the patent is utterly void for want of authority in the officer issuing it, and does not in any manner bind the State, giving no protection, as title, against any person, the three years adverse possessor can not prescribe under it. League v. Rogan, 59 Texas, 427; Davilla v. Mumford, 24 How., 23; Smith v. Power, 23 Texas, 33; Bates v. Bacon, 66 Texas, 348; Gunter & Munson v. Meade & Bomar, 78 Texas, 634; Marsh v. Weir, 21 Texas, 110; Steagall v. Huff, 54 Texas, 193; Veramendi v. Hutchins, 48 Texas, 531. The decision in Winsor v. O’Connor, 69 Texas, 571, construing section 4, article 14, of our Constitution, and interpreting the phrase “ land titled,” might seem to be in conflict with this result. It seems to us, however, that a patent might be entirely without efficacy to pass any character of title as against the State, or to give protection, as title, against any person, and still be held effective, by force of that provision of our Constitution, enacted in furtherance of public policy and not to confer any private right, to withdraw the land from location. The point is made by appellants in their brief, that if it be assumed that the original certificate to Donato Leona was only for one labor of land, the Commissioner, in issuing a duplicate, was not entirely without jurisdiction to act, and that therefore the grant, though excessive, would not be absolutely void, but only voidable, citing the case of Maxey v. O’Connor, 23 Texas, 235. This question, though not expressly decided, seems to have been, in effect, passed upon in the case of Gunter & Mun-son v. Meade & Bomar, discussed above. It is not entirely clear to the mind of the writer, however, that this contention is without force. Delivered December 13, 1892. These conclusions dispose of all the assignments of error which relate to the merits of the controversy. The objections raised by exception to the authority of the Attorney-General to intervene in the name of the State are not well taken. Rev. Stats., art. 1265; Laws 1887, p. 138; The State v. Delesdenier, 7 Texas, 95; The State v. Thompson, 64 Texas, 690. The assignments which relate to the admission of testimony are likewise not well taken. A part of the deposition of R. M. Hall, Commissioner of the Land Office, might not have been admissible, but the court before whom the case was tried without a jury, in the explanation appended to the bill of exceptions, states that the testimony which we think was objectionable was excluded from his consideration. It follows that the judgment of the court below must be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. A motion for rehearing in this case was overruled.","The Texas Land and Mortgage Company, Limited, et al. v. The State of Texas et al. No. 301. 1. Land Certificate — Void Duplicate — Case Followed. — As a duplicate certificate professes to confer no rights other than such as the original gave, if there be no original it confers no right whatever; following Gunter v. Meade, 78 Texas, 634. It seems also held in that case that the fact of an original certificate having been issued for one labor would not give such jurisdiction to the Commissioner of the GeneralLand Office as would render a duplicate for a league and labor issued thereon voidable only, and not void. 2. Patent Void — Three Years Statute of Limitations. — Although the three years statute of limitations is applicable where the patent purports to pass the legal title, and does pass all the title the State has or can convey, though in fact no title passes to the grantee, yet where the patent is utterly void for want of authority in the officer issuing it, and does not in any manner bind the State, the three years adverse possessor can not prescribe under it. 3. Same — “ Land Titled” — Case Distinguished. — The case of Winsor v. O'Connor, 69 Texas, 571, construing section 4, article 14, of our Constitution, and interpreting the phrase “ land titled,” held not in conflict with this case. A patent may be entirely without efficacy to pass any character of title as against the State, or to give protection as title against any person, and still be held effective by force of that provision of our Constitution enacted in furtherance of public policy, and not to confer any private right, to withdraw the land from location.

"FISHER, Judge, Section B. This suit is by appellee to recover from appellant $5000 as damages resulting from injuries received by his wife in travelling from St. Louis, Missouri, to Dallas, Texas. The case was tried by a jury, and resulted in a verdict and judgment in appellee’s favor for $2020.45. The petition, in substance, alleges: That on or about the 13tli day of September, 1886, plaintiff’s wife wishing to visit the city of St. Louis, he purchased from the agent of the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company at Dallas, Texas, a first class excursion ticket for his wife from Dallas, Texas, to St. Louis and return. That he paid for said ticket the sum of $20.80; that said agent then and there stamped said ticket and the said Lillie Martino signed the same, as-required by the terms of said ticket. That said ticket was good for the-return trip until October 29, 1886. That on the 13th day of September,. 1886, the said Lillie Martino, with her little child, started from Dallas on the cars of the Houston & Texas Central Railway, and proceeded on said cars to Denison, Texas, and then proceeded to St. Louis from Denison on defendant’s road. That in going to St. Louis said ticket was duly honored by the conductors of said roads, and that the said Lillie Martino had no trouble in going from Dallas to St. Louis. The petition then alleges, that said Lillie Martino, having finished her visit at St. Louis, on October 6, 1886, presented said ticket to the agent of defendant at its office in St. Louis, and requested him to sign and stamp-the same, as required by the terms of said ticket. That said agent looked at said ticket contemptuously, handed it back to said Lillie Martino, and refused to have it signed or stamped, saying it was “ no good.” That she was a stranger in St. Louis, and had spent all the money she had taken with her, and having with her her little child, did not know what to do. That she got on defendant’s train of cars at St. Louis and started home. That the conductor from St. Louis to Sedalia examined her ticket and passed her to Sedalia without objection. That at Sedalia another conductor took charge of said train; that she showed him her ticket, and that he refused to honor the same. That she told him she had no money, and that he then took her baggage check and told her he would let her ride to Dallas, and that he would notify the next conductor of this arrangement. That at Parsons, Kansas, the next conductor took charge of said train, and that when he came round for tickets it was midnight, and that she was lying with her head on the seat in front of her and was asleep. That this conductor, upon reaching her, caught her by the hair and jerked her head back, nearly breaking her neck, and said to her in a violent and insulting manner, “ Madam, your ticket.” That his manner was so violent and insulting that she became very much frightened. That she told him she had given the conductor from Sedalia to Parsons her trunk check, and that said conductor had promised she could ride to Dallas, and that she asked the conductor if the former conductor had not told him that he had her check for her trunk. That the conductor then in a very insulting manner told her he knew nothing about her trunk check, and that she must either pay her fare or get off the train. That she told him she had no money. Then he told her to give him her watch and chain as security for her fare, and that he would let her ride to Dallas. That he said “ pay me the fare, give me your jewelry, or get off the train.” That, being alone with her little child and among strangers, and the conduct of the conductor being so violent and harsh, she did not know what to do, and gave him her watch and chain. That he then handed her back her trunk check, although he had just before denied having it. That when said train reached Denison, said conductor deposited said watch and chain with appellant’s ticket agent there to secure her fare to Dallas. That plaintiff afterwards had to send to the ticket agent at Denison $20.45 to redeem said watch and chain for fare wrongfully charged his said wife. That when plaintiff met his wife at the train on her arrival at Dallas, she was in tears and nearly distracted; and she then told him of the wrongs, insults, and indignities she had suffered on her trip at the hands of defendant’s agents; that he took her home, and she was sick and confined in her room for a number of days, and was unable to attend to her duties, and the same caused your petitioner much pain and anguish; that all such sickness, pain, and anguish was caused from acts of defendant’s agents as aforesaid. Defendant pleaded a general demurrer, and excepted specially: First. To all that portion of said petition which charges that its agent at St. Louis refused to countersign said ticket as required by the terms of said ticket, and that said agent contemptuously handed the ticket back to plaintiff’s wife, saying it was no good; that Mrs. Martino was without money and did not know what to do, and got upon defendant’s train, etc.; because the same are irrelevant and inadmissible matters in this suit, and were injected in it to prejudice the rights of appellant. Second. To the allegations of pain and anguish suffered by petitioner, because the husband’s anguish is too remote. Third. To the allegations of said petitioner charging that its conductor-approached plaintiff’s wife while she was asleep, and caught her by the-hair and jerked her and nearly broke her neck, because said allegations-are too improbable and lack verity on the face thereof. Defendant further pleaded a general denial, and specially pleaded that . according to the terms of said ticket or contract, in order for Lillie Martino to be entitled to return thereon from St. Louis to Dallas, it was contracted and agreed, for and on account of the reduced rate or charges-therefor, that she would sign said ticket at St. Louis and have the same stamped by defendant’s agent at St. Louis, and that if she failed so to do,, that""said ticket was to become null and void; that she did fail so to do, and that said conductor, as he was in duty bound to do according to the terms of said ticket or contract, refused to accept said ticket and demanded her fare. Defendant expressly denied that its conductor caught plaintiff’s wife by the hair, or jerked her, or in any other way mistreated her, but that-he, to the contrary, treated her kindly, credited her for her fare from St. Louis to Dallas, taking security therefor, she being a stranger to him,, which amount plaintiff afterward paid, as he was in duty bound to do, upon which payment the watch and chain given as security for her fare were returned to her. The court overruled the general and special demurrers. These are the facts briefly stated: September 13, 1886, appellee, for the use of his wife, purchased from the Houston & Texas Central Eailway Company at Dallas, Texas, a first class tourist ticket, good until October 29, 1886. The ticket was signed by Mrs. Lillie Martino, the wife of appellee, and entitled her to passage from Dallas, Texas, to St. Louis, Missouri, and return. The ticket contains a stipulation, that it is not good for return passage unless the holder signs the same and identifies himself as the original purchaser to the satisfaction of the authorized agent of the-Missouri Pacific Eailway Company at St. Louis, Missouri, on or before-October 15, 1886, and when duly witnessed by the agent and dated in ink, and duly stamped by said agent, the ticket shall then be good until October 29, 1886; and that the original purchaser agrees to sign his name- and otherwise identify himself as such whenever called upon to do so by any conductor or agent of the lines over which the ticket reads; and on failure or refusal the ticket shall become void. Mrs. Martino travelled from Dallas to St. Louis on the ticket. About October 5 or 6, 1886, desirous of returning to Dallas, she presented the ticket to the ticket agent of the Missouri Pacific Eailway Company at St. Louis, with request to sign and stamp same. The agent returned the ticket to her, with the statement that it was not good, and refused to sign and stamp it. She then, without the ticket being signed or stamped by the St. Louis agent, boarded appellant’s train on her return trip to-Dallas. The conductor oh appellant’s train between St. Louis and Sedalia, Missouri, honored the ticket, and passed her to the latter place. There another conductor took charge of the train and ran it to Parsons, Kansas. The conductor between Sedalia and Parsons examined the ticket and refused to permit her to ride on it, and demanded of her her fare in money. Mrs. Martino then stated to him that she had no money. He then asked if she had any baggage, and upon her replying she had, he then demanded her baggage check, which she delivered to him. The conductor then handed her a paper check, telling her to keep it; that she could ride to Dallas on it. About midnight another conductor took charge of the train at Parsons, and ran it to Denison. Mrs. Martino testified, “ That it must have been about this time of the night. I was resting my head upon my arm on the seat in front of me, and the conductor came along and struck me on the head hard, and said, 1 Ticket, madam,’ in a very rough manner. He said, ‘I want your ticket.’ I handed him the ticket, but he did not hardly look at it before he said it was not good. He said he would have to have baggage, money, or jewelry, or I would have to get off the train. I said I would like to have, my trunk. I asked him if he knew the name of the man who took my trunk check. He said, ‘ No; I don’t want any explanations; all I want is money, jewelry, or baggage.’ I told him that I did not have any money. He said he wanted my watch and chain. I had my watch in my bosom and the chain was exposed to view. I told him the other conductor had my trunk check. He told me that he did not know anything about the other conductor, and did not know any^ thing about my trunk check. As soon as I handed him my watch and chain he handed me the trunk check. He told me I would have to get off if I did not give him my watch and chain. I told jiim I would telegraph the Exchange Bank for money, but he would not wait. I told him my name, and that it was on my trunk. It xyas a new trunk. It was what you call a lady’s travelling trunk. This conductor was talking very loud. Everybody in the car heard what he said. I gave him my watch and chain, and then he handed me my trunk check. I rode on to Denison all right. * * * “Theconductor struck me with his hand. He knocked my head back. He struck me and pulled my head back. I had done nothing to him. I was not asleep; I was just resting. He did not say anything, but just hit me, and said, ‘ Ticket, madam.’ I had no warning that he was going to hit me. He said 1 Ticket, madam,’ very roughly, and I handed him my ticket, and he tore off a coupon and said it was not good. I explained to him what the other conductors had done. The coupons from St. Louis to Denison were not taken off the ticket by me. They took them off. The agent at Denison gave me a piece of paper and told me to keep it, and when I should send him $20.45 he would send me my watch and chain. He and the conductor furnished me a ticket from Denison to Dallas. I got home (to Dallas) about 6 o’clock in the evening. I met my husband at the depot. I felt very bad and ashamed when I came home. When I got home, I laid down on the bed for sometime. “ When the conductor struck me, it was not far from Parsons. It was that time he was taking up fare. The treatment I received from the conductor excited me very much at the time. I felt mortified and ashamed. I could not explain how I did feel. Nobody was with me except a child of mine. I knew no one in the coach. I met my husband at Dallas, at the depot, and told him what had happened to me. I told him all about it. I was crying at the depot at Dallas. I was crying and sobbing at Denison over my treatment. I asked the conductor to get me a ticket from Denison to Dallas. He promised me he would. At Denison I had to hunt him up, and then he and the agent gave me the ticket to Dallas. He told me my fare was $20.45, and I could send him the amount and he would return watch and chain. When I got to Dallas, I sent to the agent at Denison $20.45, and he sent me my watch and chain.” Appellee Martino testified: “ That he paid $20.80 for the ticket when he purchased it from the Central Railway Company at Dallas. His wife went to the ticket office with him, and she there signed the ticket. I met her at the depot at Dallas on her return. She was looking pale and had been crying. I asked her what was the matter. She said, 11 have got no more watch; the ticket was not good; the ticket agent would not sign it.’ I sent the $20.45 to get the watch and chain. After my wife returned, she was sick and in bed for sometime after she came back. She was confined to her room and in bed in the daytime. That he felt ashamed and bad over it. She told me the way she had been treated by the conductor between Parsons and Denison, and said it made her feel bad and ashamed. Did not send for any physician to see my wife. She was not very sick, but she felt bad over the way she had been treated.” C. C. Odem, witness for defendant, testified: That he was ticket agent at Dallas, and sold the ticket to Mrs. Martino, and that he had authority to sell it, and that it was sold for one fare for the round trip. The regular fare to St. Louis from Dallas is $20.20. Witness Waggener, the conductor between Parsons and Denison, contradicts the evidence of Mrs. Martino as to what occurred between them on the train, and denies any ill treatment of her. He further testifies, that he requested her to write her name so that he could identify her signature with that on the ticket, but she refused to do so; and he further states that if she had done so, he would have permitted her to ride on the ticket, and it was upon her refusal that he demanded fare. The conductor also testified that Mrs. Martino, at the time he examined the ticket, told him that she tried to get it signed at St. Louis and could not do so. Mrs. Martino denies that any request was made for her signature, or that she be identified, but she told him her name and that she had letters in her satchel from her husband, and that she could identify herself, and that her name was on her trunk. Appellant’s first assignment of error relates to the action of the court in overruling defendant’s first special exception; because Mrs. Martino was not entitled to return transportation from St. Louis to Dallas upon said ticket, for the reason that the same had not been signed and stamped at St. Louis, as required by the contract, and that she was a trespasser upon defendant’s train, and the acts of said agent at St. Louis are irrelevant and inadmissible; that plaintiff’s cause of action, if any, is dependent upon the conduct of the conductor. Appellant’s second assignment of error questions the following charge given by the court: “ If the evidence before you in this case satisfies your minds that Mrs. Martino, on or before October 29, 1886, went to the authorized agent of the defendant at St. Louis, Missouri, and was ready to identify herself as the original purchaser, and asked and requested said agent to sign and to ■stamp the ticket, and this request was by said agent ref used; and you further find that as a result of said refusal to sign and stamp the ticket, that the conductor in charge of defendant’s train refused to recognize and receive said ticket, and threatened to put her off the train, and demanded security for her fare over defendant’s line of road; and if the evidence further satisfies your minds that while plaintiff’s wife was such passenger on her return trip, the conductor in charge of defendant’s train acted in a harsh, ungen tlemanly, and oppressive manner toward her, by reason of the fact that the ticket was not signed and stamped, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover the actual damages occasioned thereby.” The objections urged to this charge are, that it assumes that a trespasser on defendant’s train was a passenger, and because the charge makes the defendant liable to plaintiff for said injuries and insults, if any, inflicted in transportation by said conductor, because of defendant’s agent’s failure to countersign said ticket at St. Louis, when the pleading and the facts show that the failure of said agent at St. Louis is irrelevant, and too remote and indirect to base said recovery upon in whole or in part. As these assignments practically raise the same question, we will consider them jointly. The conduct of the agent at St. Louis was an important fact to be alleged and proven in order to show the right of Mrs. Martino as a passenger on appellant’s train, and to negative the idea that she was a trespasser. The averments of the petition show that she, at St. Louis, did all that could reasonably be expected of her in complying with her contract. She tendered the ticket to the agent at St. Louis, with the request that he sign and stamp it; that he refused to do so, giving as a reason that the ticket was not good. The averments of the petition show that the ticket was good, and all that it needed was his signature and stamp. The tender and offer of performance of the contract by Mrs. Martino, and the refusal of the agent to observe it, did not relieve the appellant of its duty to transport her to Dallas. It was the duty of the agent, as shown by the terms of the contract, to sign and stamp it when presented by Mrs. Martino for such purpose Her right to be carried as a passenger on appellant’s train was not lost by reason of the arbitrary refusal of the agent to perform and observe a stipulation of the contract that his-principal had entered into. The right of passage springs from the contract made with the carrier; the ticket is the evidence of this right; but what is contained therein or omitted therefrom is not in all cases to be considered as conclusive of the rights of the passenger travelling upon the ticket. For the agent issuing, the ticket, or some agent through whose hands it must pass, by reason of negligence or willful failure to perform his duty, may fail or refuse to do-something required by the contract of carriage that should have been done, in order to make the ticket embody the conditions and terms of the contract as actually agreed to. The passenger who complies with his contract does not lose his right to transportation because of the error or mistake of the agent in failing or refusing to do that which is necessary to show the passenger’s right. Under such circumstances it is not incumbent on the passenger to pay an additional fare. He can rely solely on the contract made with the carrier. Pennsylvania Co. v. Bray, 125 Ind.,. 229; Railway v. Mackie, 71 Texas, 491; Wightman v. Chicago, 40 N. W. Rep., 691; Head v. Railway, 7 S. E. Rep., 217; Railway v. Bamley, 16 Atl. Rep., 67. We do not think there was error in overruling the demurrer, or that the court erred in giving the charge. The charge presents the entire case to the jury growing out of the facts that show the wrongful acts of the agent at St. Louis in refusing to sign and stamp the ticket, and the wrongful acts of the conductors in their conduct towards Mrs. Martino. It leaves them to fix the cause and effect of all these acts from the beginning to the end of the conduct of the parties, at St. Louis and to Denison. We think it was proper that all of these facts should be considered by the jury. The conduct of the agent at St. Louis is admissible for the purpose of showing the effect it produced, and further to negative the fact that Mrs. Martino was a trespasser and to show her right on the train. The case of Mosher v. Railway, 21 American and English Railway Cases, 283, relied on by appellant, is unlike this case. There the purchaser of the round trip ticket that was required to be stamped and signed by the agent did not present it to the agent, and consequently he did not refuse to sign or stamp it. There was no refusal by the agent to do what was agreed should be done that amounted to a violation of the contract. The agent was not present at the ticket office when the holder of the ticket desired that it should be signed and stamped. Without seeing the agent, he boarded the train with the ticket unstamped and unsigned. It was refused by the conductor. In the case before us, there is a violation of the contract, a refusal of the carrier to sign and stamp the ticket as it had agreed to do. It is contended that the court erred in overruling the demurrer presented by appellant, to the effect, that appellee could not recover for the pain and mental anguish suffered by him; and also, that the court erred in refusing to give a charge asked by appellant to that effect. It is decided in the case of Telegraph Company v. Cooper, 71 Texas, 507, that pain and mental anguish suffered by the husband on account of injuries inflicted upon the wife can not be considered as an element of damages in a suit to recover damages flowing from such injuries sustained by the wife. While it may have been error in the abstract to have overruled the demurrer, and to have refused the charge, we do not believe it was such error as would require a reversal of this case. The court, in its. charge, pointedly instructed the jury that as an element of damages they could only consider the mental anguish and sense of shame, if any, suffered by Mrs. Martino by reason of the treatment of the conductors, etc. The effect of this charge was to eliminate from the mind of the jury the consideration of any question as to mental anguish and suffering by the husband. The effect of the charge was to piirge the record of any issue of mental suffering experienced by the husband, as presented either by the pleadings or evidence. In fact, giving consideration to all the allegations of the petition, it is doubtful if any claim for the mental suffering of the husband is presented. The evident purpose was to make the sickness, pain, and anguish experienced by the wife the sole basis of the action for damages. It is not seriously contended that the evidence presents a state of facts that show that the husband relied upon his mental distress as an element of damages, or that he sought recovery for such, reason. But upon the contrary, the only logical conclusion that can be-drawn from the evidence is, that it was the anguish and suffering experienced by the wife that the jury considered, or could consider, in rendering a verdict. It is contended that the verdict of the jury is excessive, and that it is not supported by the evidence. We think the evidence sufficient to support the judgment, and we do not believe the verdict excessive. If the evidence introduced in behalf of the plaintiff is true (which the jury evidently so considered, and we see no reason to doubt the correctness of their conclusion), it presents a case of gross insults and indignities inflicted upon her by a brutal conductor in the employment of appellant,. and while engaged in the performance of service within the line of his duty. At the hour of midnight, among strangers, she was assaulted by the conductor striking her in the presence of others, threatening to then remove her from the train, with her child, if she did not surrender to him her watch and chain. This, after she had exhibited her ticket and explained to him why it was not signed and stamped by the St. Louis agent, and after she had offered to identify herself, and after be had received from the other conductor the baggage check which she had delivered as collateral to secure the payment of her fare to Dallas. Under such circumstances, she, in order to prevent her removal from the train, being without money, surrendered to the conductor her watch and chain. The physical and mental pain suffered by a lady who has experienced ""the outrages and insults shown to have occurred in this case, can not be measured by anjr standard of value that would limit the jury in awarding her such amount as they in their discretion may see proper. There is no rule in a case of this kind that determines when the amount awarded is excessive. As said in the case of Railway v. Gilbert, 64 Texas, 541: “ It is difficult to compute in figures what sum will repay the plaintiff for the gross insults and physical and mental pain to which she has been subjected by the misconduct and rudeness of the employes of a railway company as detailed by the witnesses in this case. The value of the time lost by her might be estimated, but the damages for her pain of body and mortification of mind must be left largely to the discretion of the jury. When they have not apparently abused this discretion, and no outside influences have been used to excite their passions or prejudices, the result of that discretion must control the judgment of this court on appeal.” We conclude the case should be affirmed, and so report it.","Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. J. F. Martino. No. 478. 1. Railway Company — Round Trip Ticket—Pleading Germane Facts.—Plaintiff purchased for his wife a roand trip ticket from D. to S., containing a stipulation that in order for it to he good for the return passage it should be presented by her within a stated time to the agent of the defendant railway company at S., and should be signed and stamped by him. She duly presented the ticket to such agent at S.. who wrongfully refused to sign and stamp it; and when she presented it to defendant’s train conductor on the return trip, he refused to honor it, treated her with great rudeness, and as she had not money with which to pay her fare, exacted the deposit of her watch as security for the fare. JETeld, that the wife was not a trespasser on defendant’s train on the return trip, her contract right of passage not being lost because of the agent’s refusal to sign and stamp the ticket, but that such refusal was well pleaded and proved by plaintiff, in connection with the other facts, as germane to his cause of action in damages for the wrongs suffered by his wife. 2. Verdict for Damages for Mental Suffering Held not Excessive.—A verdict of @2000 for the mental suffering of plaintiff's wife resulting from rude and violent treatment of her by defendant’s agents and train conductor, held not excessive in this case. 3. Practice —Harmless Error in Overruling Special Exception. Error in overruling a special exception is harmless where the charge of the court excludes from the consideration of the jury the matter to which the exception is addressed. ON REHEARING. 4. Damages for Mental Suffering of Husband not Recoverable, When.—Pain and mental anguish suffered by the husband on account of injuries inflicted upon the wife can not be considered as an element of damages in a suit by the husband for the wife to recover damages flowing from such injuries sustained by her. Following Telegraph Company v. Cooper, 71 Texas, 507. See the opinion for a charge of court held, under the pleadings and proof, not to exclude such element of damage from the case. Appeal from Dallas. Tried below before Hon. R. E. Burice. This cause was first decided by the Commission of Appeals, Section B, February 22, 1892, and their report adopted by the Supreme Court; but a motion for rehearing having been granted, the case was transferred to the Court of Civil Appeals for final determination. Alexander & Clark, for appellant. 1. The ticket is the only evidence to be regarded by the conductor as to the passenger’s rights of transportation. The ticket contained an express contract, which in terms provided, that it should be presented to defendant’s agent at St. Louis, there signed by the passenger and stamped by said agent, before the passenger would be entitled to return transportation from St. Louis to Dallas on the ticket. This express contract was lawful and valid; and the passenger having failed to comply therewith, before boarding defendant’s train should have provided herself with a ticket or fare for her return transportation; and failing to do so, was a trespasser upon defendant’s train. Plaintiff not suing for a breach of the contract by defendant’s agent at St. Louis, but suing for injuries inflicted upon plaintiff’s wife by defendant’s conductor, the acts of the agent at St. Louis, and the other fact that plaintiff’s wife was without money, were not germane to plaintiff’s cause of action sued upon, and should have been excluded.

"KEY, Associate Justice. This suit was brought by appellee, P. S. Sowell, as assignee of the firm of Roby & Nichols, to recover the value of certain personal property alleged to belong to him as such assignee and to have been seized and converted by appellant McGuffin as sheriff of Guadalupe County, etc. Appellee’s title to said property and right to recover for its conversion depends upon the validity of a deed of assignment, which reads as follows: “ The State of Texas, Guadalupe County. — Know all men by these presents, that whereas the firm of Roby & Nichols, which said firm is composed of W. S. Roby and M. R. Nichols, residents of said State and county, are justly indebted in divers sums of money, which the said Roby & Nichols are unable to pay in full, to different creditors whose names are stated in the annexed list; and whereas the said Roby & Nichols desire to make a fair distribution of their property and assets among such of their creditors as will consent to accept their proportional share of their estate and discharge them from their respective claims in accordance with the provisions of the statutes; “ Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises, and the sum of Si to us in hand paid by P. S. Sowell, of said State and county, the said Roby & Nichols doth by these presents bargain, sell, release, and set over unto the said P. S. Sowell all their real and personal estate, other than that which is by law exempted from execution. “ To have and to hold unto him, the said P. S. Sowell, and his successors, in trust, for the benefit of creditors of the said Roby & Nichols aforesaid; and the said P. S. Sowell on his part agrees faithfully to perform his duties as assignee in accordance with the statute concerning assignments for the benefit of creditors. “ In testimony whereof we have hereunto set our hands, this the 11th day of November, 1886. « Eoby & Nichols, “ W. S. Roby. “ The State oj Texas, Guadalupe County. — Before me, C. L. Arbuckle, county clerk of Guadalupe County, on this day personally appeared M. R. Nichols, a member of the firm of Roby & Nichols, known to me to be the person whose name is subscribed to the foregoing instrument, and acknowledged to me that he executed the same for the purposes and consideration therein expressed. “ Given under my hand and seal of office, this 11th day of November, A. D. 1886. [Seal] “ C. L. Arbuckle. “The Stale of Texas, Guadalupe County. — Before me, C. L. Arbuckle, county clerk of Guadalupe County, on this day personally appeared W. S. Roby, known to me to be the person whose name is subscribed to the foregoing instrument, and acknowledged to me that he executed the same for the purposes and consideration therein expressed. “ Given under my hand and seal of office, this 12th day of November, A. D. 1886. [Seal] “ C. L. Arbuckle, “ County Clerk Guadalupe County. “ Filed for record at 4 o’clock p. m. on November 11,1886. Recorded November 27, 1886. <«C. L. Arbuckle, “ County Clerk Guadalupe County.” To this instrument was attached a list of creditors of Roby & Nichols, with the amounts due each. November 11, 1886, M. R. Nichols, one of the two partners composing the firm of Roby & Nichols, executed this assignment by signing the firm name thereto and acknowledging it, as shown by the officer’s certificate. Appellee accepted the trust and qualified as assignee on the same day, November 11,1886. On the following morning, November 12, 1886, the firm of Meyer & Bulte, defendants in the court below and appellants in this court, sued out an attachment against Roby & Nichols and had the same levied on the stock of merchandise, which appellee had taken possession of under the above deed of assignment. Appellee recovered judgment in the District Court for the value of these goods, and from that judgment this appeal is prosecuted. After the levy of the attachment, and on the same day, W. S. Roby signed and acknowledged the assignment. Previous to the execution of the assignment by Nichols, Roby verbally gave his consent for Nichols to make the assignment. It was not shown whether or not the firm owned any real estate, nor what, if any, individual property not exempt from forced sale was owned by either member thereof. Appellants contend: 1. That the deed of assignment does not upon its face purport to convey all the property other than exempt property belonging to each individual composing the firm of Roby & Nichols, as well as the property of said firm, and that for that reason the court erred in construing it to be a valid assignment. 2. That one partner can not make a valid assignment by virtue of the Act of 1879 for the benefit of accepting creditors for a firm without the written authority of all the members not signing the deed of assignment. Upon the authority of Coffin v.' Douglass, 61 Texas, 406, and cases there . cited, we think the deed of assignment, if executed in a manner to bind both partners, conveyed all the property belonging to either, as well as. the partnership property, not exempt from forced sale. It may be conceded that the terms of the instrument in this regard are ambiguous and susceptible of two constructions; but such being the case, the rule is well settled that the construction which will sustain its validity and render it operative should be adopted. Burr, on Ass.. 480. As to appellants’ other proposition, it is true that in so far as Nichols was acting for Roby in executing the assignment he was Roby’s agent; and it is also true that an agent can not convey his principal’s real estate unless he has written authority so to do (.Revised Statutes, article 548); but it does not follow from this that every assignment executed by an agent without written authority is void. An assignment under the statute for the benefit of accepting creditors must convey all the property not exempt from forced sale, whether individual or partnership, belonging to the person or persons making such assignment; but when the assignor owns no real estate subject to forced sale, we see no reason why an assignment made by an agent acting under verbal authority only should not be held valid. Delivered October 26, 1892. In Kittrell v. Blum, 77 Texas, 336, it is stated in the opinion that such an assignment would be valid, though such statement was not necessary to a decision of that case. Applying this rule to the assignment before us, our opinion is that the court below erred, in the absence of testimony showing that Roby owned no real estate subject to forced sale at the time the same was executed by Nichols, in holding it to be a valid assignment. It purports to convey real as well as personal property, and this we think is sufficient to place upon those claiming under it the burden of showing the facts which will render it certain that it did pass title to all the property owned by each member of the firm not exempt from forced sale, as well as that belonging to the partnership. If upon another trial it is made to appear that Roby owned no real estate subject to forced sale at the time the assignment was executed by Nichols, then it should be sustained and held valid; otherwise it should be held void. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","Hugh McGuffin et al. v. P. S. Sowell. No. 27. 1. Assignment — Construction of Deed. — A deed of assignment by a firm owning no real estate, executed by one of its members, conveying to a trustee for the benefit of the firm creditors “ all their (the partners) real and personal estate other than that which is by law exempted from execution,” conveys all the property belonging to either member of the firm, as well as the partnership property not exempt from forced sale. 2. Assignment Executed by one Member of Firm. — An assignment executed by one member of a firm, purporting to convey the firm property, and made under parol authority from the other member or members of the firm, is valid if the assets were personal property, but not if real estate was owned subject to execution. 3. Assignment Construed. — An assignment executed by one member of a firm having parol authority from the other member, and purporting to convey both real and personal property, maybe sustained by proving that no real estate was owned by the firm or by the other member of the firm. In absence of such proof the assignment would be held invalid. Appeal from Guadalupe. Tried below before Hon. Geo. McCormick. Burges & Dibrel, for appellants. 1. Where one partner makes the assignment for the firm, the partner making such assignment must have the written authority of his copartner. Say les’ Civ. Stats., art. 65a; Rev. Stats., art. 548. 2. A valid assignment for the benefit of creditors under the Act of 1879 must convey all the property of the debtor, both real and personal, except that which may be exempt by law from forced sale; and if the assignment be by copartners, it must convey the firm property as well as the individual property of each member of said firm. If an assignment fails in this respect, it is void and passes no title against objecting creditors. Donoho v. Fish Bros. & Co., 58 Texas, 164; Still v.

An assignment for the benefit of creditors may be made in the name of the firm by a single partner, by the authority or with the consent of his co-partners, with the same effect as if made by all; and where neither the firm nor the individuals composing it own any real estate which should pass by the assignment, it is wholly unnecessary that the partner executing the assignment should have written authority for so doing.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This suit was brought by appellant to recover a balance of $1439.85 due for lumber sold appellee. The defense set up was, that appellee had purchased from time to time, through one W. L. Whittaker, various bills of lumber from appellant, the Bowie Lumber Company, and the Jefferson Lumber Company, both corporations. and from the following firms: Whittaker & Rosborough, Whittaker, Galloway & Co., Whittaker & Galloway, and W. L. & B. Whittaker. He alleged that W. L. Whittaker was interested in and general agent and manager of all of the said concerns; that all of his dealings with said concerns, including appellant, had been through said Whittaker; and that in transacting the business the orders for lumber had been placed with the different concerns by Whittaker at his discretion, and that all payments for the lumber so purchased had been made to or through or under the direction of said Whittaker. There was much conflict in the evidence. The seventh assignment of error complains of that part of the fifth paragraph of the court’s charge wherein the jury were instructed, that a payment to W. L. Whittaker, or to a firm of which he was a member, would be a payment to appellant. In so far as this charge, under the circumstances therein stated, instructed the jury that a payment to Whit-taker would be a payment to appellant, it is believed to be correct; but in charging the jury that a payment made to a firm of which Whittaker was a member would be a payment to appellant, we think it was erroneous and misleading.' The fact, as set forth in that paragraph of the charge, that Whittaker was the general agent of the several firms and corporations in selling lumber and collecting the money, would not of itself authorize a payment of moneys due appellant to a firm of which Whittaker was a member, but in which appellant was not interested. It may be that the statement of facts does not fully present the case as tried below, and that as there presented the charge was not misleading, but we must pass upon the record as we find it. If there was evidence showing that Whit-taker had authority, real or apparent, to direct and did direct the payment of money due appellant to others, it has escaped our attention. It is not believed that the other assignments of error would require a reversal of the judgment, and as they relate to matters which may not arise upon another trial, they will not be further considered. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 23, 1893. Justice Head did not sit in this case.","Bowie Lumber Company v. O. T. Lyon. No. 118. Agency—Authority of General Agent to Apply Payments.—The plaintiff sued for balance due on lumber, and defendant answered that he purchased his lumber from a number of firms, including plaintiff, through one W., who was interested in and general agent of them all, and bad paid for it to W., or under liis direction. The court charged that a payment to W., ‘‘ or to a firm of which he was a member,” would be a payment to plaintiff. Held, error, in the absence of evidence of authority in W. to direct payment of money due-plaintiff to a firm in which it was not interested, since the fact of his general agency for all the firms would not of itself authorize it. Appeal from Grayson. Tried below before Hon. P. B. Muse. H. C. Hynson and Woods & Maxey, for appellant. The charge of the court was calculated to lead the jury to believe that a payment by Lyon to any of the firms of which Whittaker was a member was in law a payment to plaintiff, without regard to any connection between said firms. W. W. Wilkins and Head & Dillard, for appellee. The expression in the charge of the court, that1 ‘ if defendant Lyon paid to said Whittaker, or a firm of which he was a member,” etc., complained of by appellant, could only be read with reference to such firms as Whittaker had been connected with in these transactions in the manner set forth in the previous part of the paragraph, and when so read it certainly could not be contended that a payment to him under the circumstances set forth would not be a good payment."
"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellee filed this suit October 24, 1889, in the District Court of Galveston County, against Samson Heidenheimer, on a verbal contract of agency, wherein he alleges, that it was agreed that said Walthew should go to England and there act as the agent of said Heidenheimer in chartering steamships for said Heidenheimer, to be loaded and freighted by him. That said Heidenheimer agreed to pay said Walthew forfiiis said services one-fourth of the profits to be realized upon the loading and freighting of said vessels, and growing out of the chartering thereof. That in pursuance of said contract, said Walthew did charter the steamship Aldersgate at Liverpool, England, on July 3, 1889, on terms satisfactory to said Heidenheimer. That said Heidenheimer loaded said steamer Aldersgate, and made profits in the sum of 86730.80, of which Walthew was entitled to $1682.70, for which he brings suit. Defendant filed a general demurrer and a general denial. Heidenheimer died pending the suit, and his executors were made parties and defended the action. On November 7, 1891, case tried by jury, and verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1390.90 principal and $172.58 interest, total $1563.48, and defendants appealed. Conclusions of fact.—1. That the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the contract, as alleged, between Heidenheimer and Walthew was proven. 2. After the making of such contract, Heidenheimer entered into a limited partnership with one E. H. Fisher for the purpose of freighting and loading vessels, to which each contributed $5000, with the agreement for an equal division of profits. 3. That Walthew, as alleged by him, chartered and sent to Galveston the Aldersgate for Heidenheimer, and that it was freighted and loaded by E. H. Fisher for the firm of E. H. Fisher & Co., and that the net profits realized therefrom amounted to $5563.62. This sum was divided between Fisher and Heidenheimer, in accordance with their contract of partnership, Heidenheimer receiving $2781.81. 4- That the contract between Heidenheimer and Walthew made Walthew the agent of Heidenheimer, his compensation for his services as such, as agreed on, being one-fourth of the net profits to be realized from the freighting of the vessel. Conclusions of law.—1. The court did not err in refusing the special charge set forth in appellants’ third assignment of error. The facts there enumerated would not constitute a partnership between Heidenheimer and Walthew. The share of profits allowed Walthew was compensation for his services as Heidenheimer’s agent. 2. The evidence was not sufficient to show such partnership, and the court did not err in refusing the second and third special instructions copied in the fourth and fifth assignments, which stated the effect such a partnership would have upon the rights of the parties. 3. The fourth special instruction asked by appellant, which is as follows, “If the jury believe from the evidence that the partnership of E. H. Fisher & Co. was a special partnership under the statutes, that E. H. Fisher was the general partner and Heidenheimer was a special partner, then Heidenheimer had no authority to bind E. H. Fisher & Co. in any contract, but Heidenheimer Bros, had the right to employ E. H. Fisher & Co., or any other agency, to load the vessels chartered by Heidenheimer and Walthew,” was correctly refused. Heidenheimer had not the right, to the prejudice of Walthew, to admit another to share in the profits of the undertaking. The rights of Walthew, under his contract, were unaffected by the subsequent agreement between Heidenheimer and Fisher. 4. The portion of the charge of the court complained of in the ninth assignment of error properly submitted to the jury, under the evidence, the question as to the proof of the contract as alleged by the plaintiff. Heidenheimer was dead, and Walthew was not allowed to testify as to the contract, but there were facts and circumstances in evidence from which the terms of the agreement could be inferred. The court properly made appellee’s right to recover depend upon proof of such a contract as he alleged. 5. There was no error in refusal of the court to suppress the depositions of Walthew, nor in allowing that of Heidenheimer to be read. 6. The verdict of the jury in finding for plaintiff one-fourth of the profits realized from the freighting of the vessel was correct. The part of the gains allowed by Heidenheimer to Fisher should not have been deducted. The judgment is therefore affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 9, 1893.","Samson Heidenheimer’s Executors v. J. F. Walthew. No. 89. 1.

Compensation of Agent Unaffected by Subsequent Agreement of Principal.—Having made such contract with H., his right to recover the compensation agreed on for his services was unaffected by subsequent agreement between H. and another to admit such other to share the profits of the undertaking. 3.

The conclusions of fact by the court and the assignments of error submitted as propositions from the brief of appellants sufficiently state the case. Finlay & Finlay, for appellants. 1. The court erred in refusing instruction numbered 1, asked by the defendants, which was as follows: “If the jury believe from the evidence that the contract was that Walthew should charter one or more steamers, in which Heidenheimer was to have a three-fourths interest and Walthew a one-fourth interest, such a contract would constitute a partnership between the parties, and not an agency on the part of Walthew.” Cothran v. Marmaduke, 60 Texas, 872; Stevens v. Bank, 62 Texas, 499. 2. Fourth assignment of error: The court erred in refusing instruction numbered 2, asked by the defendants, which is as follows: “If the jury believe from the evidence that the contract entered into between Heidenheimer and Walthew was a partnership, then Heidenheimer would have the right to employ such agencies as were necessary to carry out the object of the partnership, and the partnership will be chargeable with the necessary expenses of the agency so employed.” 3. Fifth assignment of error: The court erred in refusing instruction numbered 3, asked by the defendants, which was as follows: “ If the jury ¡believe from the evidence that the contract entered into between Heidenheimer and Walthew was a partnership, and that Heidenheimer was to have a three-fourths interest in their said venture, and Walthew was to have a one-fourth interest'in said venture, then ” etc. * * * Randall v. Merideth, 76 Texas, 682; 1 Bates on Part., secs. 315, 334; Meek. on Ag., Sec. 45. 4.

The court erred in overruling defendants’ motion to strike out and suppress the depositions of plaintiff J. Fred Walthew, on the ground that the commission to take his said deposition issued within five days from the time the original interrogatories were filed and served on defendant, the interrogatories having been filed and served on the 16th of January, crossed on the 21st, and the commission issued on the 21st of January, 1891. 7. The depositions of Samson Heidenheimer were taken January 15, 1891, filed January 15, 1891, and Samson Heidenheimer died February 22, 1891. The depositions should not have been admitted in evidence; because Heidenheimer was the original defendant in the suit; he had died before the trial; and because said depositions were taken under title 38, chapter 3, of the Revised Statutes, at the instance of plaintiff, without notice or opportunity to be crossed; and said Heidenheimer being dead, defendants as his executors are deprived of an opportunity of cross-examining, or producing his evidence in explanation of his answers as contained in said depositions.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellee was a passenger upon one of the appellant’s trains from Beaumont to Liberty. When the latter place was reached the train did not come to a stop, but slackened its •speed so that two male passengers safely alighted in appellee’s presence. Appellee, when the name of the station was announced, had gone upon the platform of the car, and was standing there waiting for the cars to stop. Seeing that they were not stopping, she asked an employe of appellant, whom she supposed to be the conductor, if she should jump off. He directed her to wait until the train got opposite the depot. The train ■continued to move on, increasing its speed, and finally appellant’s servant told her she would have to jump off, which she did, receiving the injuries for which she seeks compensation in this suit. There is a conflict of evidence upon all of the material facts just stated, but the issues having been submitted to a jury by a charge of which no complaint is made, and the jury having found in appellee’s favor, we must conclude that all the facts testified to by witnesses which are necessary to sustain the verdict are established. In view of these facts, we conclude that appellant was guilty of negligence in not stopping its train at the station, and that appellee was not, under the circumstances testified to by her and her witnesses, guilty of negligence in trying to alight, so as to preclude her from recovering. We therefore conclude as matter of law, that appellant is liable in damages for this breach of its contract of carriage. The amount found by the jury is not claimed to be excessive, and is warranted by the evidence. The point made in appellant’s fifth assignment of error, that the evidence fails to show that the train on which she was a passenger, and the servants of whose negligence she complains, were those of appellant, was not raised in the motion for a new trial in the court below, and can not therefore be considered here.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This suit involves the title to 62.27 acres of land out of the Thomas Chambers survey, in Collin County. It was brought by the appellant against the appellees, in the District Court of Collin County, and resulted, on January 19, 1889, in a verdict by a jury, and in a judgment accordingly, in favor of appellees, from which appellant prosecutes this appeal. 1. Prior to October, 1871, the land in controversy was the separate property of Mrs. Sarah F. B. Ford, wife of L. D. Ford. 2. At that date Mrs. Sarah F. B. Ford, joined by her husband, L. D. Ford, executed what purported to be a deed of conveyance to said land to one J. G. Hatch. This instrument was recorded September 9, 1879. 3. The certificate of the officer taking the acknowledgment to this instrument fails to state that he explained it to Mrs. Ford. 4. This instrument is the common source of the title of plaintiff and defendants, and was so introduced and relied upon at the trial. 5. It recited as a part consideration therefor three promissory notes executed by Hatch, aggregating the sum of $150, and payable to Sarah F. B. Ford or bearer. 6. Neither the instrument itself nor the notes expressly retain the vendor’s lien to secure the payment of the deferred purchase money. The notes, however, recite that they were given in part payment of the land. 7. On each of the notes is an endorsement by Sarah F. B. Ford and L. D. Ford, assigning it to B. W. Rhine, appellant, and guaranteeing its payment. 8. After this endorsement, and in February, 1873, B. W. Rhine brought suit, No. 1351, upon these notes in the District Court of Collin County, against J. Gf. Hatch, the maker of the notes, and against Mrs. S. F. B. Ford and her husband, L. D. Ford. In this suit plaintiff sought judgment for the amount of the notes and a foreclosure of a vendor’s lien upon the land in question. 9. December 1, 1873, B. W. Rhine obtained a judgment as prayed for in cause No. 1351, which was followed by an order of sale dated January 9, 1874, and a sale thereunder on the first Tuesday in February, 1874, and a sheriff’s deed in accordance therewith, promptly recorded. 10. The instrument from S. F. B. Ford and husband to J. Gf. Hatch, Supplemented by the foreclosure proceedings culminating in a sheriff’s deed,-constitutes the appellant’s title to the land in controversy. 11. December 28, 1871, J. G. Hatch, by deed, conveyed the land to one John G. Bailey, who died in March, 1878, or about that time, leaving surviving as his heir his daughter L. A. Bailey, who afterward intermarried with Louis Hodge, and, with him, is the appellee herein. 12. This deed from Hatch to Bailey was not recorded until December 9, 1879. 13. There was evidence, which the jury found to be true, showing that at the time of the institution of the foreclosure suit, No. 1351, John G. Bailey was in possession of the land, claiming it under the deed from Hatch; and when this suit was brought appellees were in possession, claiming under the same deed. 14. As already indicated, John G. Bailey was not a party to the foreclosure suit, No. 1351. There are several assignments of error. We do not, however, think it necessary to set them out, or to consider them separately. The complaint, in each of them urged, is founded upon the following portion of the court’s charge: ’ “ If you [the jury] believe from the evidence that plaintiff in said foreclosure suit ever had actual notice or was in law chargeable with notice of said deed from Hatch to Bailey, you will find for the defendants; and in deciding as to whether plaintiff had such notice or not, you are instructed that if you believe from the evidence that at the time of the institution of said foreclosure suit, on the 27tli day of February, 1873, the said John Bailey was in actual possession of said land and living thereon, you will find that plaintiff was chargeable with notice of said deed.” The deed from Mrs. S. F. B. Ford and her husband to Hatch, on account of the omission of the officer to show that he had explained the instrument to the wife, could not, unaided, serve as a source of title, either legal or equitable, in plaintiff or in any one else. Berry v. Donley, 26 Texas, 737; Johnson v. Bryan, 62 Texas, 625; Ruleman v. Pritchett, 56 Texas, 483; Jones v. Robbins, 74 Texas, 615. The charge in question indicates the conclusion by the trial court that Mrs. Ford, by virtue of the judgment in the foreclosure suit, was estopped from denying the validity of the deed from Hatch. We are not required to consider the soundness of this conclusion; because, as the appellant’s contention is founded upon it, lie is in no condition to complain of it. The charge, however, indicates the additional conclusion by the court that this estoppel would inure as well to the benefit of John G. Bailey, and to his heir Mrs. Hodge, as to the appellant. It is of the latter conclusion that appellant complains. He insists that as to him the deed was in all respects validated by the foreclosure suit; but that as to Bailey and his heirs it was and is a nullity. If there was an estoppel against Mrs. Ford on account of the judgment of foreclosure, it had reference to the deed in question. The notes involved in that suit were executed in consideration of the deed, and if they were adjudicated to constitute a lien upon the land, it was only because it had also been adjudicated that the land had been conveyed. The judgment, therefore, had necessary reference to the deed, and if by the-judgment title was divested out of Mrs. Ford, such divestiture had relation to the deed and to the date thereof. The benefit of such divestiture extended to the vendee in the deed, J. G. Hatch, and to all his privies in estate, as well to his vendee Bailey, the ancestor of the appellee Mrs. Hodge, as to the plaintiff claiming under the foreclosure proceedings against Hatch. We, therefore, for the purpose of disposing of this question, treat the deed as having been in all respects validated by the foreclosure proceedings. Now, as neither the deed nor the notes contemporaneously drawn expressly retained the vendor’s lien, the former, as an executed contract, must be admitted to have passed the legal title to Hatch, subject only to the implied vendor’s lien. In such a case, the holder of the purchase money notes must sue not only the maker of the notes, but also the subsequent purchaser, if there be one, of whose claim the plaintiff has notice, actual or constructive. The legal title in the latter by virtue of the deed can not be affected by the foreclosure proceedings unless he be made a party thereto. Ufford v. Wells, 52 Texas, 612; Robinson v. Black, 56 Texas, 215; Ransom v. Brown, 63 Texas, 188; Foster v. Powers, 64 Texas, 247. Under the facts of this case, as there was evidence showing that at the time of the institution of the foreclosure proceedings appellee’s ancestor was in the actual possession of the land, claiming it under the deed from Hatch to himself, appellant will not be heard to complain of the court’s instruction that such possession would operate as notice of the existence of the deed. Watkins v. Edwards, 23 Texas, 443; Hawley v. Bullock, 29 Texas, 223; Mainwarring v. Templeman, 51 Texas, 212; Wimberly v. Bailey, 58 Texas, 227. Delivered November 22, 1892. Hence the legal title, remaining in Bailey unaffected by the plaintiff’s foreclosure proceedings, and passing by inheritance to the appellee Mrs. Hodge, can not be subordinated to appellant’s claim. If, on the other hand, the court erred in holding that the judgment in the foreclosure suit operated as an estoppel against Mrs. Ford, appellant will be remitted to the void deed as the basis of his title. In that event, being required to recover on the strength of his title, and being without title, he could not maintain his cause. We therefore hold that the judgment should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.. Affirmed. Justice Head did not sit in this case.","B. W. Rhine v. Louis Hodge and L. A. Hodge. No. 32. 1. Possession as Notice. — Actual possession of land operates as notice of the existence of an unrecorded deed under which the possessor claims title. 2. Married Woman’s Deed — Defective Acknowledgment. — When the certificate of acknowledgment of a deed made by a married woman to convey land which is her separate property fails to state that the officer explained the deed to her, such deed can not unaided serve as a basis of title, either legal or equitable. 3. Foreclosure of Vendor’s Lien — Necessary Parties. — Where there is a suit to foreclose an implied vendor's lien on land (neither the notes given for the purchase money nor the deed executed to the maker of the notes expressly retaining the lien), a third person then in actual possession of the land under deed from the maker of the notes holds the legal title, which remains unaffected by such foreclosure proceedings unless such third person is made a party thereto. . 4. Estoppel by Judgment, Effect of. — A deed by a married woman was defectively executed, and she was afterward sued on the notes given to her for the purchase money and endorsed by her, and in that suit a vendor’s lien was foreclosed against the land, with sale thereunder. Held, that if the effect of such judgment was to validate the defective deed, as against her, by estoppel, then such estoppel would inure in favor of a subsequent purchaser of the land from her vendee in such deed, as well as in favor of the purchaser at such foreclosure sale.

Where it appears from the certificate of an officer taking the acknowledgment of a married woman to a conveyance of her separate property that he did not fully explain the deed to her as required by law, the legal title to said land does not pass by such conveyance.” In such a case the purchaser at best only acquires an equity.

Where the.legal title remains in the vendor, and where the vendor transfers the notes to another party, the vendor holds the legal title in trust for the benefit of the holder of the notes as well as for the vendee, should he subsequently pay the notes; and such legal title will be divested through a sale made under a foreclosure of the lien. Russell v. Kirk-bride, 62 Texas, 456; Hamblen v. Folts, 70 Texas, 132; Land and Cattle Company v. Boon, 73 Texas, 549. 3. Where the vendor of land does not part with the legal title, and the vendee sells to a subsequent purchaser, who takes actual possession of the land, in a suit to foreclose the vendor’s lien it is not necessary to make such subsequent purchaser a party. Foster v. Powers, 64 Texas, 250; Ufford v. Wells, 52 Texas, 612; Land and Cattle Company v. Boon, 73 Texas, 549. 4. While the deed from Mrs. Ford to Hatch was defective and did not pass the title to him, yet she, having sold the notes growing out of that transaction to Rhine, and having endorsed and guaranteed the payment of the same to him, in the suit brought by Rhine on the notes and to foreclose the lien, to which suit she was a party, and having there failed to assert her title to the land, would be estopped as against Rhine from afterward asserting her title thereto; and the purchaser at such foreclosure sale bought the title she owned. Such estoppel does not, however, inure to the benefit of defendants, but only to Rhine, the purchaser at such sale, and those having his estate therein. Webb v. Mallard, 27 Texas, 85; Henderson v.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This appeal is prosecuted by Willliam Cassin from a judgment rendered in the District Court of Martin County against him, in favor of La Salle County, on the 18th day of September, 1889, for the recovery of the four leagues of school land set apart to La Salle County under the Constitution and laws of this State. The case was tried without a jury, and is brought here on conclusions of law and fact, accompanied by a statement of facts. The conclusions of fact filed in the court below are here referred to and adopted as our conclusions of fact, except the sixth and eighth conclusions, which are not approved. The record discloses that in 1883 appellant made a written proposition to the Commissioners Court of La Salle County, by which he agreed to furnish vacancies for the location of these four leagues of school land, and to locate the same, paying all the necessary charges in any way con-, nected with the locating and patenting of the same, and to pay the county for the lands located by him 30 cents per acre on ten years time at 7 per cent interest per annum, payable semi-annually, from the date of his proposition, which was August 14,1883, only however binding himself to take or purchase 8856 acres, with the privilege of the rest. This proposition was accepted by the Commissioners Court; and thereafter, in October of the same year, he made a further proposition in writing, stating that in the previous proposition he had contracted with the Commissioners Court to purchase the four leagues of land after being located at his expense, and that since making that contract he had reason to believe that he could get four leagues for the county set apart out of the land reserved for unorganized counties, etc., and proposed, in the event he so succeeded, to agree to pay $1000 additional, to be added to the price per acre stipulated in the August contract, to be paid in accordance with the terms of. said August contract; and that in consideration of said $1000 the County Commissioners Court should aid him by petitioning the Commissioner of the Land Office, etc.; stating that in the event he failed to get them located in the reservation, the terms of the old contract should remain as they then existed on the records of the court. This was also approved and entered of record on October 5, 1883, and on the same day the county commissioners, with the county judge, made their application to the Commissioner of the Land Office for patents to the four leagues of land out of the 325 leagues reserved and set apart for the benefit of the unorganized counties. At a meeting of the Commissioners Court in November of the same year the patents were produced by appellant, and the county judge ordered to execute deeds to appellant. . At the October meeting, when the second proposition was submitted, upon the adjournment of court appellant made a verbal promise to pay an additional $1000, which at the November meeting he was requested or urged by one of the commissioners to do, but which he declined to do. Finally, however, a compromise was effected as to the additional amount claimed under the verbal promise, and the total amount was fixed at $7000. In pursuance of said order of the Commissioners Court warranty deeds, reciting $7000 as the consideration, were duly executed to said appellant, who up to the trial had made his semi-annual interest payments, had gone into the possession of the land by tenants in 1885, had made permanent and valuable improvements thereon, and had paid all the taxes on the same, and the surveyor’s fees and locating expenses. The proof tended to show that the land was worth at the date of its sale about 50 cents per acre, as well as at the date of the trial. Evidence was introduced as to the value of the improvements and as to the value of the rents, but there was no proof as to how much the improvements enhanced the value of the land. In 1888 La Salle County brought a suit to recover the land, which was dismissed early in 1889, and a second suit brought, which resulted in the judgment appealed from. The written propositions of appellant to the Commissioners Court and the proceedings of said court in relation thereto are set out-in the pleadings of both parties, and are here referred to for fuller explanation of these conclusions. The court below held that the sale to appellant was void, because a part of the consideration was other than money. On the authority of Tomlinson v. Hopkins County, 57 Texas, 572, we are of opinion that the sale must be held invalid. The first assignment -complains that the court refused to allow appellant and another witness to state that in the negotiations for the purchase and sale of the land in controversy the services and expenses of appellant did not enter into, nor were they considered by appellant or appellee as forming any part of, the consideration for the land.. The facts and circumstances existing at the time the several propositions and contracts were entered into were fully developed in the proof. Appellant alleged and set out the same propositions and contracts asserted by appellee, copying the same writings in his pleadings, and did not allege any new or different contract from that disclosed by said written instruments. While it maybe that the ground of objection that oral testimony could not be admitted to contradict or vary a written instrument, as urged by appellee in the court below as a reason for the exclusion of said evidence, was not sufficient for that purpose, still we are of opinion that the proposed evidence, which was itself largely a matter of opinion, would not have changed the result had it been admitted. The second assignment, which complains of the action of the court in admitting the minutes of the Commissioners Court of Martin County for the years 1888 and 1889 to show the valuation placed by that court on the lands in controversy for those years, can not avail appellant, though the testimony was erroneously admitted, because there was no finding upon the issue, and the error was an immaterial one. The third assignment complains that the court refused and failed to find what it was, and its amount, that entered into the consideration for the purchase and sale of said land over and above the sum of $7000 mentioned in the deed. The answer to this assignment is, that no additional finding was requested, and the general finding that other considerations than money entered into the purchase was not specially excepted to. A general exception will not reach such a defect. The fourth assignment complains that the court erred in giving rent to plaintiff below on the land from November 17, 1883, and this assignment we think is well taken. Plaintiff did not take possession of the land or use it in any way until the spring of 1885, so far as the record shows. There seems to have been no effort to disaffirm the sale until the year 1888. As improvements were not allowed, if this suit be treated as an action of trespass to try title, appellee was not entitled under the statute-to recover rents for more than two years preceding the institution of this suit; if it be treated as an equitable suit to rescind a sale, then the rents at most should not have extended beyond such time as a purpose was manifested on the part of appellee to rescind said sale — certainly not beyond the time when appellant took possession in the year 1885. The fifth assignment, that appellant should have been allowed the amount of taxes, etc., paid by him, is not well taken. The one remaining assignment complains of the action of the court in refusing to allow appellant the value of his improvements placed on the land, aggregating the sum of $7820. This presents the most serious question in the case. The court below, in the seventh conclusion of facts, found that there was no actual or intended fraud in the sale or purchase of said land; but in the eighth conclusion found that defendant was not a purchaser in good faith, entitled to pay for his improvements. Doubtless the court rested his determination of the issue of improvements in this case upon our statute on that subject and the decisions construing it. In this we think there was error. While appellee brought the suit in trespass to try title, the purpose of the action was to annul a deed executed by the county of La Salle to appellant, for want of authority in said county to sell on the terms agreed upon. Appellant in his answer set up his equities as vendee under the contract sought to be annulled, and alleged the money paid appellee and the valuable improvements made under the contract upon the land sought to be recovered. We think under our system that the case as thus presented should have been treated as a suit for rescission, in which “ the right to the value of improvements and the measure of its allowance ’ ’ should 1 ‘ depend on principles of equity, and not on the provisions of the statute regulating the action of trespass to try title.” Patrick v. Roach, 21 Texas, 256; Eberling v. Deutscher Verein, 72 Texas, 341. Delivered October 25, 1892. We are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed as to the recovery of the land, and reversed and remanded for further proceedings in reference to the other issues involved, and it is accordingly so ordered. Reversed and remanded.","William Cassin v. La Salle County. No. 8. 1. County School Land — Void Sale. — Where a part of the consideration of the sale of county school land is other than money, such sale, under the authority of Tomlinson v. Hopkins County, 57 Texas, 572, must be held invalid. 2. Practice — Immaterial Error. — The erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence that would not have changed the result of the suit is immaterial error. 3. Practice — Finding of Court. — That the finding of the court on a given point is not sufficiently specific is an objection not tenable on appeal, unless the finding was specially excepted to at the time, and an additional finding requested. 4. Rescission of Sale — Rents and Improvements. — Where an action in the form of trespass to try title is in effect an equitable suit to rescind a sale of land for want of power in the plaintiff to have made it. the plaintiff is not entitled to recover rents beyond the time when he manifested a purpose to rescind, or the time when defendant took possession; and in such suit the principles of equity, not the provisions of the statute regulating the action of trespass to try title, should control as to the value of improvements made by defendant under the contract, and the measure of its allowance to him. Appeal from Martin. Tried below before Hon. William Kennedy. The opinion states the case. John Ireland and S. G. Newton, for appellant. 1. The defendant should have had judgment for the land. The evidence clearly shows that Cassin purchased for a fair money price, without fraud of any kind; that the land was conveyed to him in the manner required by law; that the sale has ever since been recognized by plaintiff as a binding and subsisting sale, ratified by the acquiescence of plaintiff and its receipt of the semi-annual interest for several years; and plaintiff is now estopped to deny the validity of the sale.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. By the service of the garnishments upon appellant in the suits of the creditors of Theo. Ash, the effects held by him under the deed of trust were put in the custody of the law, ■and a lien was fixed upon them in case they were subject to Theo. Ash’s debts in favor of the plaintiffs in those suits. Focke, Wilkens & Lange v. Blum, 82 Texas, 439; Harrell v. Cattle Co., 73 Texas, 614. It was the duty of the garnishee to hold them, in order to apply them in accordance with the judgment of the court, when it should determine the rights of the parties. Waples on Attach., 290-292. If he has converted them into money, this may make him liable to the garnishing creditors for their value; but it does not, we think, defeat his right, as against appellee, to hold the proceeds with which to meet such liability, if established by the courts in which those suits are pending. Appellee by his garnishment acquired no greater right to the fund held by appellant than Gabriel Ash had. Appellant, it is true, received the money in trust for Gabriel Ash, but the latter had no right to recover it of him so long as there were garnishments in force requiring appellee to hold it. Waples, 197-199. The court below, therefore, should not have rendered judgment requiring appellant to pay over to appellee a part of the funds thus held, unless the bond of indemnity entitled the latter to it. We know of no authority by which a garnishee may be required to surrender property which he is entitled to hold for his protection, and to accept in its stead the personal undertaking of the creditor and sureties. The authorities cited by appellee do not sustain such a proposition. That Gabriel Ash is not a party to the other suits, and not therefore to be bound by judgments which may be rendered therein, does not affect the question. Appellant is a party, and a judgment may be rendered against him as garnishee in favor of the creditors of Theo. Ash, which will bind him. Gabriel Ash is not a party necessary to a valid judgment in those suits. The cases cited by appellee are not applicable. Alamo Ice Co. v. Yancey, 66 Texas, 187-189; Arthur v. Batte, 42 Texas, 159. In the first case, the garnishee in his answer admitted his indebtedness to the judgment debtor, and asked no relief. An intervenor came in, asserting a right to the debt owed by the garnishee. His petition was excluded on exception, and there stood before the court the answer of the garnishee admitting the indebtedness and giving no reason why judgment should not be rendered against him. The court held that no course was open but to render judgment. In Arthur v. Batte a creditor of Batte had garnished one Hughes in the Federal court. Batte had subsequently recovered judgment against Hughes in a State court on the demand sought to be reached by the garnishment, and was proceeding to collect it by execution. • Arthur, the creditor, sought an injunction to restrain such execution in aid of his garnishment. The court held, that he could not maintain such proceeding, because, among other reasons, it was for Hughes to take proper steps to protect himself against double liability. Here the appellant sought the protection of the court in which appellee’s garnishment was pending. His plea was very defective, and the exceptions to it should have been sustained. But the court overruled them, holding the answer sufficient; and appellant then showed a state of facts which, under the ruling on the exceptions, should have exempted him from judgment. The court held him liable because a bond was tendered to secure him against loss. Thus by the action of the court he was prevented from doing anything more than he had attempted, and at the same time judgment was rendered against him on a ground which, we have seen, did not authorize it. When the case goes back the exceptions to the answer should be sustained, and if appellant then seeks to perfect his pleadings, he should be allowed to do so, and an opportunity afforded him to take such other timely steps as will protect him against double recoveries. The case should not be indefinitely continued until the other cases are disposed of, nor unreasonably delayed, but such proceedings should be had as to reach a definite determination of the rights respecting the fund. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 26, 1893.","Henry Ash v. D. A. Akin. No. 204. 1. Effect of Garnishment. — When the trustee in a deed of trust made by the debtor for the benefit of certain preferred creditors, is garnished by the non-preferred creditors, who attack the validity of the trust deed upon the ground of fraud, the sendee of the writ places the effects held by him under the trust deed in the custody of the law, and fixes a lien upon them, in case they are subject to the nonpreferred debts of the debtor, in favor of such creditors. 2. Bight of Garnishee to Hold Effects. — The garnishment suits in which the trustee had been cited as garnishee not having been decided, and the trustee being directed by the trust deed to pay over proceeds of sales of goods to the preferred creditors, and the question of the validity of the trust deed being undecided, it was the duty of the garnishee to hold the goods or their proceeds, in order to apply them in accordance with the judgment of the court, when it should determine the rights of the parties. A subsequent garnishment creditor had no better right to the proceeds of sales in the hands of the trustee than did G. Ash, to whom, by the terms of the trust deed, it ivas payable; and neither had right of recovery so long as there were garnishments in force against the trustee. 3. Bond of Indemnity.—We know of no authority by Avhich a garnishee may be required to surrender property which he is entitled to hold for his protection, and to accept in its stead the personal undertaking of the creditor and his sureties. 4. Garnishee Entitled to Protection, When.—Though the trustee had money in his hands, proceeds of sales of the goods, which by the terms of the trust deed may have been payable to G. Ash, the debtor of appellee, and though G. Ash was not a party to any of the other garnishment suits, the trustee is a party to them, and judgment may be rendered against him as garnishee in favor of those creditors, and G. Ash is not a necessary party to a valid judgment in those suits; and as the garnishee seeks the protection of the court against a double liability, he is entitled to it. 5. Delay.—The case should not be indefinitely continued until the other cases are disposed of, nor unreasonably delayed, but such proceedings should be had as to reach a definite determination of the rights respecting the fund. Appeal from Anderson. Tried below before Hon. W. G. W. Jo wees. December 15, 1890, Theo. Ash executed a deed of trust, by which he conveyed to Henry Ash, trustee, two stocks of goods. The deed of trust directed that the goods should be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of certain preferred creditors of Theo. Ash, and one of the named preferred creditors was Gabriel Ash, to whom was due 84800. While Henry Ash was executing said trust, and prior to June 20, 1891, eighteen nonpreferred creditors of Theo. Ash, whose debts amount to more than the entire proceeds of the goods, filed suits against Theo. Ash for the recovery of their respective debts, and sued out writs of garnishment against Henry Ash, the trustee, attacking the validity of the trust deed, upon the ground that it was fraudulent, and that the $4800 debt claimed to be due Gabriel Ash was fictitious and unreal. All of the garnishment suits were pending at the time of trial of this case, except one, in which the validity of the trust deed had been sustained in the District Court, but the case was still pending on appeal when this cause was tried. Akin sued Gabriel Ash on June 20, 1891, and at the same time sued out a writ of garnishment against Henry Ash, and on July 8, 1891, recovered judgment against Gabriel Ash for $379.20 and costs. The answer of Henry Ash as garnishee admitted that he had in his hands $3613.38, proceeds of sale of the goods, to be paid on the debt due Gabriel Ash, set out the above facts, and claimed that no judgment could be rendered in this case until a decision as to the validity of the trust deed. Akin tendered the garnishee a bond of indemnity, and the court gave judgment against him, and directed that he should pay over to the clerk of the court the amount of Akin’s judgment within one day after the adjournment of the court. Gregg & Reeves, for appellant. Thomas B. Greenwood, for appellee."
"HEAD, Associate Justice. On the 5th day of August, 1886, William A. Johnson was run over and killed by one of the hand cars of appellee, where its track crosses a wagon road at what is known as McPherson’s Crossing, in Johnson County, Texas. It seems that deceased was blind, and was in the rear end of a wagon leading a horse, which wagon was being driven by his father, George Johnson. The two were going after some water for their joint use, and to also give water to the horse which was being led, and which was their joint property. In approaching the crossing, the driver, George Johnson, saw the hand car when it was at a distance of 500 or 600 yards, and there was nothing to prevent the hands on the car from also seeing the wagon. When the wagon reahhed the crossing the car was at a distance of from 50 to 65 yards, and it seems that the horse deceased was leading, just as the wagon got over the track, became frightened and pulled back, throwing deceased upon the track in front of the car, where he was struck. From the injuries so received the said William A. Johnson died on the 6th of August, 1886, and appellants instituted this suit to recover the ■damage caused them by such death. Appellants complain at the action of the court in giving the following charge to the jury: “ If the defendant’s employes in charge of the hand car saw the wagon of G. W. Johnson, in which deceased was riding, stop before reaching the railway, and were thereby led to believe no effort would be made to cross said railway, until it passed the crossing, then it was not negligence in said employes not to stop said hand car,” etc. Some of the witnesses testified, that when the wagon got near the crossing it stopped and then started again; while others testify that no stop was made, and still others that there was no entire stop, but only a slight checking of the horses. That this charge in this state of the evidence was upon the weight of the evidence, and was therefore improperly given, is well illustrated by quite a number of cases in this State. See Railway v. Roberts, ante, p. Ill, where a number of these cases are referred to; Costley v. Railway, 70 Texas, 112. The question as to what does or does not constitute negligence where there is a conflict in the evidence, is one peculiarly for the jury. The charge is also objectionable, in that the jury might have understood therefrom that the court was of the opinion that the wagon did stop, and only left it for them to decide as to whether or not appellee’s employes saw it and were influenced thereby, when, as we have seen, it was a controverted question as to whether or not the wagon stopped at all. The giving of this charge will therefore necessitate a reversal of the judgment; and without undertaking to discuss the several errors assigned, by appellants seriatim, we will attempt to givers concisely as possible, our views of the law applicable to the case as it may be presented upon another trial. The grounds relied upon by appellants in their petition for recovery are two: 1. They allege gross negligence on the part of the servants of appellee in charge of the hand car. 2. They allege negligence on the part of appellee in permitting the use of a defective hand car, or of a hand car not provided with the most efficient kind of brakes. This death having been caused in 1886, prior to the amendment of our statute upon this subject, to entitle appellants to recover on account of the acts of the servants of appellee it will be necessary that the evidence show gross negligence on their part. Railway v. Kutac, 76 Texas, 474; Railway v. Hill, 71 Texas, 451. It is doubtful whether in this class of cases it is advisable for the trial court to attempt to define what is meant by the term “ gross negligence.” Railway v. Shuford, 72 Texas, 170. But, if it be deemed necessary to make this attempt, the definition as given in the charge of the court does not seem to us to be objectionable. Railway v. Kutac, supra; Railway v. Cocke, 64 Texas, 156; Railway v. Shuford, supra. If, however, appellants base their right to recover on the negligence of appellee in permitting the use of an improper car, it will only be necessary for them to show ordinary negligence on its part. Railway v. Geiger, 79 Texas, 13; Railway v. Johnson, 1 Texas Civ. App., 103. That it is the duty of a railway company to adopt well tested inventions and improvements for the protection of persons lawfully upon its track at highway crossings, we think there can be no question. Mr. Pierce, in his excellent work on Railroads, page 355, says: “ The duty of the company to avail itself of well tested inventions and improvements which materially contribute to safety, has been much considered with reference to its passengers; but it is a duty which extends also to other persons rightfully using or crossing its track. Thus it should use the brakes which are found to be the most efficient for stopping trains.” If, therefore, the jury, under proper instructions, should find that deceased was not chargeable with contributory negligence in being upon appellee’s track at the time he was run over by its car, and appellee was guilty of ordinary negligence in permitting the use of said car under the rules of law herein indicated, and this negligence was the proximate cause of the death, it would be liable therefor. The proximate cause of an injury is ordinarily a question for the jury, and it is very difficult to give a definition which will apply to all cases. In the case of Jones v. George, 61 Texas, 352, in quoting from Railway v. Kellogg, 94 United States, 475, it is said: 4‘ It is generally held, that in order to warrant a finding that negligence is the proximate cause of an injury, it must appear that the injury was the natural and probable consequence of the negligence or wrongful act, and that it ought to have been forseen in the light of the attending circumstances.” The definition given by the court in its charge is perhaps subject to criticism when so tested; but in the connection in which it was given it furnished no cause of complaint to appellants, being in their favor and not to their injury. In deciding whether or not deceased was guilty of contributory negligence in being caught upon the track of appellee, several important questions are presented. In the first place, is negligence on the part of .the driver of the wagon to be charged to him ? If the jury should find that deceased and his father were engaged in a joint undertaking, it is settled in this State that each would be responsible for the negligence of the other. Railway v. Kutac, 72 Texas, 643. And without undertaking to review the numerous cases in this country discussing the noted English case of Thorogood v. Bryan, 8 C. B., 115, we think it is fairly deducible from the authorities that if deceased was blind so as to be unable to take care of himself, and of his own volition confided himself to the care of his father, the negligence of such custodian should be imputed to him; in such case he would be his agent. For a full discussion of the different cases upon this interesting question, see Beach on Contributory Negligence, commencing at section 103; also note to Gray v. Railway, 22 American and English Bailway Cases, commencing on page 355. In deciding as to whether or not George Johnson was guilty of negligence in attempting to cross the track in front of the car, it will be necessary for the jury, under proper instructions, to take into consideration all the attendant circumstances, such as the distance the car was from the crossing at the time the attempt was made, the speed at which it was coming, and also the kind of car. The jury might find that a person would be justified in attempting to cross in front of a hand car when he would not be justified under the same circumstances were the car being drawn by a locomotive. 2 Wood’s By. Law, 1315. If it be found that there was time to cross the track in safety under ordinary circumstances, it would seem that Johnson should not be charged with contributory negligence for failing to anticipate an unusual occurrence, such as falling upon the track, unless there was reason to anticipate such falling from the surrounding circumstances: Pierce on Bys., 347; 2 Wood’s By. Law, 1314. In this State it is held, that even where a person is wrongfully on the track, if an unforseen accident or providential cause intervenes which retains him there, his negligence in going upon the track will be deemed the remote and not the proximate cause of his injuries, and he will not thereby be precluded from recovering. Railway v. Sympkins, 54 Texas, 615; Roberts v. Railway. supra. If, therefore, the jury should find that had it not been for the horse pulling deceased off of the wagon the crossing would have been made in safety, and that it was not negligence on the part of the driver in failing to anticipate this result, and that appellee was guilty of negligence in permitting the use by its servants of an improper car, or that appellee’s servants were guilty of gross negligence, and that such negligence on the part of appellee or its servants was the proximate cause of the injury, and should such findings be sustained by the evidence, we think appellants would be entitled to recover. Appellants present a number of assignments, calling in question the action of the court below in the admission of evidence. It is hardly probable that these objections will arise in the same form upon another trial. The evidence seems to have been offered to impeach appellants’ witness George Johnson, by showing that he had made statements ont of court inconsistent with his evidence given upon the trial. We think the proper predicate was laid for most, if not all, of these questions. The law upon the admissibility of this kind of evidence is so well settled that there need be no error made in the rulings upon this branch of the case upon another trial, without further dicussion from us. We think what we have already said sufficiently indicates our views upon the other questions raised by appellants’ assignments of error. Let the judgment of the court below be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 17, 1893. A motion for rehearing in this case was overruled.","Nettie M. Johnson et al. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company. No. 46. 1. Negligence—Charge on Weight of Evidence.—J., who was blind •and riding in a wagon driven by his father, was leading a horse behind it. As the wagon crossed over a railway track, the horse, becoming frightened, pulled back, throwing J. on the track in front of an advancing hand car, which struck and killed him. In a suit against the railway company for causing the death, the court charged, that "" if the employes in charge of the hand car saw the wagon of G-. W. J., in which deceased was riding, stop before reaching the railway, and were thereby led to believe no effort would be made to cross said railway until it passed the crossing, then it was not negligence in said employes not to stop said hand car.” The evidence was conflicting as to whether the wagon stopped before crossing the track; and in this state of the proof the charge above was objectionable as being on the weight of evidence, and also as intimating that in the opinion of the court the wagon did stop. 2. Railway Company’s Duty to use Improved Inventions.—It is the duty of a railway company to adopt well tested inventions and improvements for the protection of persons lawfully on its track. Permitting the use of a hand car not supplied with the most efficient brakes will, where an injury proximately results therefrom, constitute ordinary negligence. 3. Negligence—Proximate Cause.—In order that negligence constitute ■the proximate cause of an injury, it must appear'that the injury was the natural and probable consequence of the negligence or wrongful act, and that it ought to have been foreseen in the light of the circumstances. 4. Contributory Negligence of Another Imputed, When.—Where two persons are engaged in a joint undertaking, the negligence of each will be imputed to the other; and where one of them, of his own volition, confides himself to the care of the other, the negligence of such custodian should be imputed to him. 5. Contributory Negligence — Intervening Cause.—Where one has time to cross a railway track in safety under ordinary circumstances, he is not chargeable with contributory negligence for failing to anticipate an unusual occurrence, such as falling upon the track, unless there was reason to anticipate-such falling, from the circumstances. Appeal from Johnson. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. Henry & Green, for appellants. 1. Whether the act of the employes,, in not stopping the car after they saw the wagon stop, was or was not negligence, was a question of fact, and should have been left to the jury. 2. It is the duty of railway companies to supply their cars with the most approved appliances, and those best fitted for the protection purposes for which they are intended, looking to the prevention of accidents and injury to persons and property. Railway v. Benson, 69 Texas, 407; Railway v. Oram, 49 Texas, 345. 3. The court erred in defining gross negligence to be an entire failure to exercise care, or the exercise of so slight a degree of care as to justify the belief that there was an indifference to the interest and welfare of others. Railway v. Shuford, 72 Texas, 170. Smith & Davis and J. W. Terry, for appellee. 1. The court’s charge, that “By the expression gross negligence is meant an entire failure to exercise care, or the exercise of such a slight degree of care as to justify the belief that there was an indifference to the interest or welfare of others,” was correct. Railway v. Shuford, 72 Texas, 170. 2. Deceased having placed himself in the care and control of G-. W. Johnson, in accomplishing their joint enterprise, and the negligence of G. W. being the proximate cause of the death, appellee is not liable therefor. Railway v. Kutac, 72 Texas, 652; Gray v. Railway, 22 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, 358."
"HEAD, Associate Justice. On the 19th day of January, 1883, Sallie G. Stuart, then a minor about three years of age, with her mother and younger sister, were passengers in a regular passenger train of plaintiff in error, going from Cisco to section house No. 19 on its line of railroad in this State. At the town of Corban, a station on said railroad a short distance from defendant in error’s destination, the train upon which she was riding was stopped and the locomotive detached therefrom and sent off on other business. When the locomotive was again coupled to the cars this was done so negligently as to cause a collision of sufficient force to throw defendant in error from the seat upon which she was sitting against the stove in the car, from which she received a cut of considerable length over one of her eyes, and also a concussion of her back from which serious injuries to her kidneys afterwards resulted. At the time of the collision between the locomotive and the cars, defendant in error, with her mother, was sitting on the seat immediately fronting the stove, the day being cold. This suit was filed by defendant in error, suing by her next friend, A. J. Stuart, against plaintiff in error, October 24, 1883, to recover damages for the personal injuries inflicted as aforesaid. The amount of damage alleged to have been caused from the injury to the head is $3000, and that alleged to have been caused from the injury to the back is $7000. A trial on December 17, 1886, resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the defendant in error for $1000 for the injuries to the head and $4000 for the injuries to the back, and from this judgment this writ of error is prosecuted. In its charge to the jury the court, in its statement of the nature of the suit, used this language: “Plaintiff brings this suit by her next friend against defendant in the sum of $10,000, for certain alleged personal injuries.” Also the court, in the eighth paragraph of the charge, used the following language: “ If you find for the plaintiff, the form of your verdict will be: We, the jury, find for the plaintiff and assess her damages, first, for the injuries to her head and consequent suffering therefrom in the sum of-- dollars (filling up the blank with the amount assessed, which must in no event exceed $3000); second, for the injuries to plaintiff’s back and consequent suffering, we assess the damages in the sum of -dollars (filling up the blank with the amount found, which must in no event exceed $7000). If you find for defendant, you will simply so say.” And plaintiff in error in its first assignment complains that this reference by the court in its charge to the amount sued for by defendant in error operated to its prejudice. We do not think the amount claimed in the petition was given sufficient prominence in the charge to operate to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error. Railway v. Burnett, 80 Texas, 538. In its second assignment plaintiff in error claims that the court erred in instructing the jury “ that the law requires the defendant to take great care in the management of its trains. ’ ’ In the case of Railway v. Burnett, cited above, a charge that carriers of passengers by rail are required to use the highest degree of care for their safety was, as we think, correctly approved, and we are clearly of the opinion that the degree of care exacted by the charge of the court in this case was not higher than .that imposed by law. In its third assignment plaintiff in error complains of this charge of the court, to-wit: “In order to defend from liability on account of alleged contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff or her mother, the burden of proof is on defendant to satisfy you of such contributory negligence under the law as herein defined.” We believe that the use of the word “satisfy” in this paragraph of the charge was error, and that to sustain the defense of contributory negligence no more than a preponderance of the evidence upon that point is required. McBride v. Banguss, 65 Texas, 177. But an examination of the record satisfies us that there was no evidence raising the issue of contributory negligence, and that no charge upon this subject should have been given. The only evidence we find in the record upon this point is the uncontradicted fact that defendant in error was sitting on a seat next the stove, by the side of her mother, and if it be conceded that a child 3 years old could in any case be chargeable with contributory negligence (which we do not wish to be understood as conceding), or if it be conceded that negligence of the parent would be imputed to the child under the circumstances of this case, which in this State is at least doubtful (Railway v. Moore, 59 Texas, 67), we are clearly of the opinion that it is no negligence for a mother in charge of a 3-year old child to occupy the seat in the car nearest the stove on a cold day, when this is necessary for their comfort. We have examined plaintiff in error’s fourth assignment and the several propositions thereunder, and are satisfied that there is nothing in the numerous objections therein made of which it can justly complain, and no useful purpose could be subserved in their discussion. The fifth assignment of error complains of the form of the verdict the jury were required by the charge of the court to adopt in case they found in favor of the plaintiff, the contention being, that the form of this verdict required the jury to find damages both for the alleged injuries to the head and to the back, when the evidence would have authorized a finding that there was no injury to the back. The form of the verdict required by the charge of the court is quoted above, and if this were all that is said in the charge upon the subject it would raise quite a serious question. We believe, however, that taking the whole paragraph of the charge together, there is no reasonable probability that the jury could have been misled in allowing damages under either head which were not caused by negligence on the part of the plaintiff in error. The paragraph in which this form of the verdict is given is as follows: “And in this connection you are charged that the liability, if any, of defendant is measured by the fact that the injury received, if any, follows approximate^ from its culpable act, if any; and if you believe from the evidence that after such injuries, if any, were received by Sallie G. Stuart, she suffered from any malady or disease, then, unless you believe from the evidence that such malady or disease proximately resulted from the injuries negligently inflicted upon her by defendant, you can not consider such malady or disease or the damages or suffering springing from such disease or malady in estimating the damages. If you find any damages for plaintiff, you can only find damages in such sum as will compensate her for the injuries, if any, directly inflicted upon her by the negligent act of defendant and following approximately from such injuries. If you find for plaintiff, the form of your verdict will be,” etc. Then follows the form of the verdict complained of. We think there is no reasonable doubt but that the jury, construing the whole charge together, understood that they were only to allow such damages as were caused by the acts of the plaintiff in error, and that they were not misled by the form of verdict prescribed by the court into allowing any damages they otherwise would not have allowed. At the same time, we do not wish to be understood as approving the language used by the court in prescribing this form for the verdict, without also informing the jury that they might find damages for one of the alleged injuries without also finding for the other, and were there any reasonable ground disclosed by the record to believe that the jury could have been misled thereby, we would feel bound to reverse the case. The seventh and eighth assignments of error call in question the action of the court in'refusing two special charges requested by plaintiff in error, to the effect that if the jury believed the injury to defendant in error’s kidneys resulted from the injury to her head, and not from the injury to her back, they should notallow any damages on account of such injuries. This is based upon the contention that defendant in error in her petition alleges the injuries to her kidneys to have resulted from the injury to her back, but we do not so construe the petition. The allegation relied upon is in this language: “That by said fall plaintiff’s back was seriously bruised and wrenched, by reason of which plaintiff suffered great and excruciating pain for many days and nights, to-wit, one hundred; her kidneys were seriously and permanently injured, and her lower limbs were paralyzed, and other injuries then and there done and resulting as aforesaid.” We construe this petition as alleging that the injury to the kidneys resulted from the fall, just as the injury to the back resulted from the fall, and not that the injury to the kidneys necessarily resulted from the injury to the back; at least we think the petition is subject to this construction, and plaintiff in error not having specifically excepted to it, we think it should not now be allowed to complain. It is. not a case in which the rule that a pleading is to be construed most strongly against the pleader should be applied. The ninth assignment of error complains of the action of the court in having expressed in the hearing of the jury a doubt as to the admissibility of a report made by certain physicians appointed by the court to examine defendant in error, and the tenth assignment of error complains at the action of the court in expressing in the hearing of the jury a doubt as to whether there was sufficient evidence as to contributory negligence on the part of the mother to authorize a submission of this issue. The language used by the court below was such as occurs in almost every trial, and we think could have been expressed in both instances in much stronger language than was used, without giving plaintiff in error any just cause of complaint. The court’s doubt as to the admissibility of the report of the physicians must have been a very serious one, and we have already held that there was no contributory negligence in the case. The eleventh assignment of error calls in question'the action of the court in overruling a motion for a new trial, upon the ground that the juror Shoate was not an impartial juror, as shown by the fact that upon one occasion at his boarding house, during one of the recesses of the court while the trial was in progress, when it was said in his presence that the jury had made up their minds on hearing the first witness, he replied, “ Yes, the railways should be pulled (or made to pay money, or some language of equivalent import) when there is a chance at them.” The fact that this juror used this language was shown by the affidavit of one H. C. Duke. At the hearing of this motion the affidavits of John Browning, W. B. Stanfield, and Billy Bearden, who were in a position to have heard this language of the juror had it been uttered, were read, and neither of them heard any such expression. After the hearing of this evidence the court proposed to withhold its ruling until the evidence of the juror himself could be obtained, but both parties expressed a willingness to submit the question upon the affidavits introduced, and the court upon this evidence overruled the motion, thereby holding that the affidavit of the witness Duke was not true in fact. If it be conceded that the motion upon its face, accompanied with Duke’s affidavit, was sufficient to authorize the granting of a new trial, which we do not decide, we think it clear that the finding of the court was amply sustained by the evidence before it. The twelfth assignment of error complains of the action of the court in refusing a new trial on the ground that the verdict is contrary .to the evidence and is excessive, but we are satisfied that the verdict is amply supported by the evidence in all respects. The fourteenth assignment of error complains that the judgment should have been rendered in favor of A. J. Stuart as next friend of Sallie G-. Stuart, instead of directly in favor of the minor herself. We are of the opinion that the proper form of judgment in such cases is to recite that the plaintiff by her next friend, naming them, do have and recover the amount of the judgment for the sole use of the minor, and that the judgment should also recite that the money when collected is to remain in court until the qualification of a regular guardian or the minor reaches her majority, and the judgment in this case will be reformed to so read. Railway v. Styron, 66 Texas, 424; Brooke v. Clark, 57 Texas, 112. A supplementary assignment of error filed by plaintiff in error calls in question the action of the court in submitting to the jury separately the question of damages to the head and back, and requiring a finding as to each. While we do not approve of this practice, we see no evidence of any injury having resulted in this case to plaintiff in error of which it can complain. Upon the whole case, we are of the opinion that the judgment in favor of the defendant in error should be reformed as above indicated, and when so reformed should in all things be affirmed, and that the costs of this appeal should be paid by plaintiff in error. Reformed and affirmed. Delivered October 18, 1892.","The Texas Central Railway Company v. Sallie G. Stuart. No. 3. 1. Charge of Court — Form of Verdict. —See opinion for a charge of court as to the form of the verdict in case the jury should find for the plaintiff, held not to give undue prominence to the amount of the damages claimed. 2. Same — Separate Claims of Damage. — Where plaintiff alleges several injuries and claims separate damages therefor, the court should instruct the jury that the verdict may find for one of the injuries without also finding for the others; but construing the whole charge together, the omission so to do held not error in this case. 3. Degree of Care Required of Railway Company. — It is not error to charge that the law requires a railway company to take great care in the management of its trains. A carrier of passengers by rail is required to use the highest degree of care for their safety. 4. Contributory Negligence — Burden of Proof. — A charge of court to the effect that the burden of proof was on the defendant to “ satisfy” the jury of alleged contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff, held, not correct. The burden of proof requires no more than a preponderance of evidence on that point. 5. Pleadings — Special Exception Required, when. — Where plaintiff alleges with reasonable precision several injuries resulting from one act, with separate claims of damage therefor, the defendant, without having urged any special exception to the manner of the averment, can not construe the pleading most favorably to himself, and require the court to charge upon such construction. Such case is not one in which the rule that the pleading is to be construed most strongly against the pleader should be applied. 6. Practice — Remarks of Court upon Evidence. — Remarks of the court in the hearing of the jury as to the admissibility and sufficiency of the evidence do not constitute reversible error when, under the facts of the case, they afford the party excepting thereto no just cause of complaint. 7. Practice — Partial Juror. — See opinion for case where, on a motion for new trial, the impartiality of a juror was attacked and sustained hy affidavits, and the action of the court in overruling the motion held correct. 8. Excessive Verdict — Fact Case. — A verdict for $5000 for personal injuries occasioned to a child of three years while riding on a railway train in charge of its mother, held in this case not to be excessive. 9. Judgment in Favor of Minor — Form of. — Where a minor sues for damages hy her next friend, the proper form of judgment is to recite that the plaintiff, by her next friend, naming them, do have and recover the amount of the judgment for the sole use of the minor, and the judgment should also recite that the money when collected is to remain in court until the qualification of a regular guardian, or the minor reaches her majority. ON MOTION FOR REHEARING. 10. Final Judgment —Next Friend. —Where a minor sues by next friend, a judgment in favor of the minor, without in express terms disposing of the next friend, is a final judgment from which an appeal can be taken. Error from Eastland. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Moore, Special Judge. L. C. Alexander, for plaintiff in error. 1. The calling of the attention of the jury to the large amount sued for is error, when from the amount of the verdict, considered in connection with the other parts of the record, it may have influenced the jury to enlarge the verdict. Railway v. Gordon, 70 Texas, 89; Newman v. Dodson, 61 Texas, 91; Willis v. McNeill, 57 Texas, 478. 2. The court erred in instructing the jury that the law requires the defendant to take great care in the management of its trains, because the same is not the law as stated. Railway v. Halloren, 53 Texas, 53; Whart. on Neg., secs. 627-629; Railway v. Greenlee, 62 Texas, 344. 3. To charge that “ the burden of proving contributory negligence is on defendant to satisfy you,” is to require more than a preponderance of evidence. 4. The judgment is erroneous, in that it should have been rendered in favor of A. J. Stuart as next .friend, as well as in favor of the minor plaintiff. A minor can not alone, without guardian or next friend, recover a valid judgment against a defendant. Smith v. Redden, 1 Posey’s U. C., 365; Abrahams v. Vollbaum, 54 Texas, 227; Evansich v. Railway, 57 Texas, 126. Fleming & Moore, for defendant in error. 1. The charge of the court was a clear and correct exposition of the law applicable to the case as made by the pleadings and proof.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This case has been twice before the Supreme Court, and may be found reported in 64 Texas at page 406, and in 72 Texas at page 1. In the year 1883, J. H. Wood, who was then a retail merchant in the town of Cisco, sold his stock of goods to appellee. At the instance of his creditors, these goods were seized under attachment by the sheriff and taken from the possession of appellee, and hence this litigation. The proof on the last trial tended, to some extent at least, to show, (1) that Wood was insolvent when he made the sale; (2) that his purpose in making the sale was to convert the goods into money in order to place them beyond the reach of his creditors (including those who afterwards attached); (3) that appellee had notice, either actual or constructive, of these facts when he purchased the goods. The. jury, however, must have found in favor of appellee on one or more of these issues, unless they were misled by the charge of the court complained of in the fifth assignment of error, which charge reads as follows: “ You are further charged, that if at the time of the sale of the goods in controversy to plaintiff (if you believe there was such a sale), Wood was solvent and had sufficient property within reach of his creditors, independently of the goods in controversy, to meet his liabilities, said sale did not have the effect to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of said Wood in the collection of their debts, then such creditors would not be permitted to question the terms or purpose of the sale by Wood to plaintiff; and if you so believe, and also believe that such sale was made to plaintiff, then you will find for plaintiff and against the defendant and his sureties.” This charge needs only to be quoted to show that it is erroneous. That an existing creditor can not be permitted to question the purpose of a solvent debtor in disposing of any portion of his estate subject to execution, where sufficient remains within reach of the creditors undisposed of to meet their liabilities, and that in such case the court may declare that the sale, though fraudulent in fact, does not have the effect to hinder, delay, and defraud such creditors, are propositions so radically wrong that their necessary tendency is to mislead. For this error in the charge, the judgment must be reversed and the cause again remanded for a new trial. We are urged by the appellants to pass also on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, but this we must decline to do. Although there have been three trials, we can not anticipate what facts the fourth may develop; nor can we presume, though we should deem the evidence insufficient (upon which we express no opinion), that under a proper charge the jury would return an improper verdict upon the identical evidence here disclosed. If the case had been submitted to us upon ■ this-issue alone, it would have become our duty to pass upon it; otherwise,, we must follow the precedents, and in view of another trial, withhold the expression of comment or opinion on the evidence. The other assignments of error are not well taken. Solely for the error in the charge, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 3, 1893.","James K. Schmick et al. v. N. W. Noel. No. 60. 1. Sale by Solvent Debtor Tending to Defraud Creditors.—A charge of court to the effect “ that if at the time of the saie of the goods in controversy Wood, the vendor, 'was solvent and had sufficient property within reach of his creditors, independently of the goods in controversy, to meet his liabilities, said sale did not have the effect to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of said Wood in the collection of their debts, then such creditors would not be permitted to question the terms or purpose of said sale by Wood,"" held to be radically wrong, and in the case at bar necessarily tending to mislead the jury. 2. Practice on Appeal.—Where a case is submitted to the appellate court alone upon the insufficiency of the evidence, that issue will be passed upon, but where there are other issues the decision of which requires a reversal of the case, this court will not pass on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, as it can not presume that the evidence will be the same on another trial. Appeal from Eastland. Tried below before J. E. Cockrell, Esq., Special District Judge. J. M. Moore and J. R. Fleming, for appellants. It is not the law that the creditors of a failing merchant can not complain if their debtor sells a larger part of his property with a fraudulent purpose, if he still has property out of which they may make their money. If he sells fraudulently, and his vendee participates in such fraud, the creditors may seize it, without regard to the fact that he has other property, for no title passes as to them. Wadsworth v. Williams, 100 Mass., 130. R. B. Truly and J. H. Calhoun, for appellee. Unless a charge is clearly misleading or prejudicial to the party complaining, the judgment will not be reversed. In considering the effect of a charge, the whole should be considered, and not merely isolated portions. Whether Wood were insolvent or not, would not affect appellee’s rights as a bona fide purchaser, if it was shown by the evidence, by reputation, or otherwise, that he believed him solvent, and had just grounds so to believe. Tillman v. Heller, 78 Texas, 597."
"ICEY, Associate Justice. This is an action of trespass to try title to about 250 acres of land near the city of Waco, commenced June 21,1881. Appellant was plaintiff in the court below, and Geo. T. Coatés and several other persons named in the pleadings were defendants. The defendants all answered, by general demurrers, pleas of not guilty, three, five, and ten years statutes of limitations, and all, except defendant Little, suggested improvements in good faith. The second trial of the case in the District Court occurred in October, 1888, in which a verdict was returned, and judgment entered thereon, for the defendants. Upon the testimony in the record this court finds: 1. Plaintiff and defendants claim title to the land in controversy under Felix W. Robertson as a common source. 2. August 23, J858, Felix W. Robertson executed a mortgage to Rebecca B. Robertson and Wilson Y. McFarland on the property involved in this suit, and on several other tracts of land in Washington and other counties in Texas. This instrument recites the fact that Felix W. Robertson had been appointed guardian of the person and estate of Felix F. Robertson, a minor, by the County Court of Washington County, and as such had in his hands between $5000 and $10,000; that Wilson Y. MeFarland and Henry Y. Robertson had become sureties on his bond as such guardian, and that he desires to secure and save them harmless, etc. It then conveys the land therein described to secure and save harmless said Felix F. Robertson, by reason of the appointment of said Felix W. Robertson as his guardian; and second, to secure and save harmless the said Wilson Y. McFarland and Rebecca B. Robertson from all liabilities incurred by them by reason of said McFarland and Henry V. Robertson having become sureties on said Felix W. Robertson’s bond as such guardian. This mortgage contains the following stipulation, viz.: “ But it is further expressly stipulated and agreed, that in the meantime the said party of the first part shall have the privilege of selling or disposing of any or all the tracts or parcels of land aforesaid, for the best price and upon such terms as he may see proper, always appropriating the proceeds thereof to the payment and extinguishment of his and his sureties’ liabilities on the bond as guardian, and not otherwise.” This mortgage was recorded in the record of deeds, mortgages, etc., of McLennan County, Texas, in which county the land in controversy is situate, on the 30th day of August, 1858. 3. On the-day of September, 1859, Felix W. Robertson executed a power of attorney to “ D. H. Love, guardian of the minor F. F. Robertson,” authorizing him to sell and convey all the several tracts of land described in and conveyed by the mortgage above referred to in the second finding. This is in the usual form of such instruments, except that it describes D. H. Love as guardian of the minor F. F. Robertson. It was duly recorded in the county clerk’s office of McLennan County, August 11, 1862. 4. October 24, 1860, a judgment was rendered in the District Court of Washington County, Texas, at the suit and in favor of David H. Love, as guardian of said Felix F. Robertson, and against Felix W. Robertson and Wilson Y. McFarland, and W. II. Robertson, administrator of the estate of Henry V. Robertson, deceased, on the bond of Felix W. Robertson as guardian of said Felix F. Robertson, for $8357.82, with 8 per cent interest from date of judgment; and with a decree foreclosing the aforesaid mortgage on all the lands covered by it, and ordering them sold as under execution for the satisfaction of said judgment for $8357.82. 5. An order of sale and execution issued on said judgment January 28, 1861, to Bell County; and the sheriff’s return thereon shows a levy and advertisement for sale, but sale held up by order of plaintiff’s attorney. Also similar order of sale to Bell County, issued May 16, 1861, with like return thereon. 6. Felix F. Robertson died October 14, 1862, while he was a minor, leaving as his only heirs Alice F, Robertson, his surviving wife, and Win. F. Robertson, their only child, and now plaintiff herein. 7. In July, 1862, D. H. Love, acting under the aforesaid power of attorney from Felix W. Eobertson, negotiated a sale of 90 acres of the land involved in this suit to E. B. Burleson, and the remainder thereof to a partnership known as Wheeler & Owens, consisting of J. W. Wheeler and S. A. Owens. July 28, 1862, Felix W. Eobertson, by D. H. Love, his attorney in fact, executed a bond for title to said E. B. Burleson, agreeing to convey the 90 acres of said land so negotiated to him (describing it by metes and bounds) by warranty deed. This instrument recites a consideration of $240 cash, and $480 to become due November 1, 1863, bearing 10 per cent interest from date. It was shown by parol evidence that all this purchase money was paid to Love. The first payment was made in July, 1862, but the testimony does not show when the other payment was made, nor does it show the amount of each payment. 8. The consideration for the Wheeler & Owens purchase was $946, and the deed executed therefor in February, 1863, recites that it was a cash payment. Parol testimony indicates that about half of it was paid in July, 1862, and the other half probably after the death of Felix F. Eobertson . 9. It was shown that there had been a bond for title for the Wheeler & Owens purchase, which is now lost; that it was also executed by said D. H. Love; and the jury found that it was executed by Love as agent for Felix W. Eobertson prior to the death of Felix F. Eobertson; and though the testimony on these issues is meager, we hold it is sufficient to support the verdict. 10. January 20, 1863, Felix W. Eobertson, by D. H. Love, agent, by warranty deed, reciting a cash consideration of $720, conveyed said 90 acres to said E. B. Burleson. This deed was duly recorded in McLennan County August 28, 1863; conveys same land described in bond for title, but does not refer to the bond. 11. February 4, 1863, Felix W. Eobertson, by D. H. Love, agent, by deed conveyed 157.7 acres, the remainder of the land in controversy, to Wheeler <fc Owens. . • Plaintiff admitted that this was a deed duly executed, but denied that it was properly authenticated for record, though it had been put on record; but as the parties have agreed that if the judgment is not affirmed the case is to be remanded, and as the question is not raised by assignment of error, the certificate of authentication is not copied in this finding. 12. Transfers from said Burleson down to defendants Allen, Hohen, Sparra, Bloomer, Eastland, and Green, to part of the Burleson 90 acres, and descent cast to balance to defendants Burlesons, Moores, and Bodneys (as shown by appellant’s brief). Transfers from Wheeler & Owens down to defendants Coates, Little, and Compton for the land acquired by them under their purchase from D. H. Love, as agent aforesaid. 13. October 5, 1874, the judgment of the District Court of Washington County, Texas-, rendered October 24, 1860, in favor of D. II. Love, as guardian of Felix F. Robertson, against Felix W. Robertson etal., was revived as against said Felix W. Robertson. 14. The suit to revive the judgment was brought by Alice F. Robertson, as surviving wife of Felix F. Robertson and as guardian of Wm. F. Robertson, the present plaintiff; and in her petition she made Felix W. Robertson, Wm. H. Robertson, as administrator of the estate of Henry V. Robertson, X. B. Sanders, administrator of the estate of Wilson Y. McFarland, R. B. Burleson, James H. Fry, John S. Allen, S. A. Owens, and J. W. Wheeler defendants. At the trial demurrers interposed by the defendants William H. Robertson, R. B. Burleson, S. A. Owens, J. W. Wheeler, John S. Allen, and James H. Fry were sustained, and they were dismissed. The latter judgment revives the former against Felix W. Robertson only, and recites that the plaintiffs being the only heirs of Felix F. Robertson, deceased, the former judgment shall be in full force and effect in their behalf as plaintiffs against said Felix W. Robertson, and that executions and orders of sale may issue, etc. 15. February 9, 1875, an order of sale and execution was issued on said judgment for sale of the land in Washington County, covered by said mortgage and decree, and same was sold thereunder to F. W. Robertson. 16. October 21, 1875, a similar order of sale and execution was issued to Bell County for the sale of the land in that county, and same sold thereunder to Mrs. Alice F. Robertson. 17. March 7, 1876, similar order of sale and execution was issued to Williamson County, and land sold thereunder to Alice F. Robertson. 18. August 23, 1876, an order of sale and execution was issued on said judgment for any balance unpaid, to McLennan County, ordering the sale of the land in controversy as under execution, with endorsements thereon showing the total credits to which the judgment was then entitled to be 81775.91. The sheriff’s return endorsed thereon shows a levy on said land September 9, 1876, due notice of sale, and sale made in pursuance thereof, in conformity to law, on the first Tuesday (3d day) of October, 1876, to William F. Robertson, plaintiff herein, for $35, and a deed made accordingly, and crediting the proceeds on the writ. 19. October 3,1876, P. F. Ross, as sheriff of McLennan County, Texas, executed a deed, in due form, conveying the land in controversy, under said writ, levy, and sale, to William F. Robertson, plaintiff herein. Said deed was duly recorded in -land records of McLennan County, October 16, 1876. 20. Neither of the heirs of Felix F. Robertson — Alice F. Robertson and the plaintiff herein — ever received any of the consideration paid by R. B. Burleson and Wheeler & Owens to D. H. Love for the land in controversy. 21. D. II. Love died in 1866, and was at the time of his death insolvent. 22. It was shown at the time of the trial that R. B. Burleson and J. W. Wheeler were dead; the former died in 1879 and the latter between 1874 and 1879,. 23. At the time R. B. Burleson and Wheeler & Owens purchased the land in controversy from D. H. Love as agent for F. W. Robertson, they had no actual knowledge of the mortgage executed thereon by said F. W. Robertson, nor of the judgment of the District Court of Washington County, foreclosing the mortgage. 24. There appears to have been testimony tending to support the pleas of limitation and improvements in good faith; but it is not set out in detail in the statement of facts, but it is agreed therein that the testimony on these issues requires that they be submitted to a jury, should the case be reversed. On the former appeal in this case (Robertson v. Coates, 65 Texas, 37), the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Willie covering the salient features of the case, held, that after the execution of the power of attorney by F. W. Robertson to D. H. Love in September, 1859, and the foreclosure, in 1860, by Love, as guardian of the estate of F. F. Robertson, of the mortgage executed by F. W. Robertson in 1858, said Love “ held united in himself, as guardian of F. F. Robertson, all the right to sell which F. W. Robertson’s power of attorney could give him, and also the privilege of having the land sold under the decree of foreclosure and in satisfaction of it. Between these two methods of converting the land into money he could choose; and by either he could convey a good title to a purchaser.” It was held, however, that his power to sell, in so far as it affected the rights of his ward, terminated with the death of the latter, and that any sales made by Love subsequent to the death of F. F. Robertson, his ward, conferred no title. The opinion then states that if the evidence had been clear and positive • that Wheeler & Owens, under whom some of the defendants claim, had purchased before the death of the ward, the judgment would have been affirmed: But as the record left the date of their purchase in doubt, and the question had not been submitted to the jury, the cause was reversed and remanded. At the trial from which this appeal has resulted this issue alone was submitted to the jury, and they found, in effect, that the Wheeler & Owens purchase was made, and bond for title executed and delivered, prior to the death of F. F. Robertson, the ward. On the present appeal, it is contended, in behalf of appellant, that the former opinion should not control the decision of the case; (1) because the facts on this appeal are different from those appearing in the record of the former appeal; and (2) because the doctrine announced, as above stated, on that appeal, is unsound and ought not to be adheredito. 1. As to the first of these positions, it is claimed that the record in the former appeal did not clearly disclose the fact that the mortgage above referred to was given to secure the ward, F. F. Robertson, as well as the sureties on F. W. Robertson’s bond. It is true that the mortgage was not copied in full in the record in that case, as it is in this; but the clause reserving the right to sell the land, and requiring the proceeds to be appropriated to the extinguishment of F. W. Robertson’s liability on his bond as guardian of F. F. Robertson, is copied in full in the statement of facts. The judgment and decree of the District Court of Washington County, rendered upon and foreclosing the mortgage in question, in favor of Love, as guardian and for the benefit of F. F. Robertson, his ward, as well as the judgment reviving the same in 1874, were copied in full in the transcript on the former appeal; and the original decree recites the fact that the mortgage was executed to secure F. W. Robertson’s indebtedness to his ward, F. F. Robertson. There is nothing in the opinion of the Supreme Court indicating that it was not understood, as clearly disclosed by the former record, that at the time of the sales to Burleson and Wheeler & Owens, F. F. Robertson, under whom appellant claims, had a lien on the land, first secured by a mortgage, but at the time of said sales merged into a judgment. On the contrary, it is apparent that the court appreciated the fact that the mortgage, given only in substance in the former record (which omits to state that it was given to secure F. W. Robertson’s ward, as well as his sureties), was the identical mortgage that was foreclosed in behalf of the ward, by the judgment of the District Court of Washington County, because in the opinion it is so stated, and it is held that the judgment referred to cancelled F. W. Robertson’s right to sell the land, arising out of the reservation, which is copied in the former record as part of the mortgage referred to. On the questions ruled on, we do not think the record before the Supreme Court, which we have carefully examined, is essentially different from the one sent up on this appeal. 2. It may be true that appellate tribunals may sometimes render decisions so obviously wrong as that other courts, of lower rank, will be justified in disregarding them upon other trials of the same cases. Such cases, however, are exceptional and of rare occurrence; and the present case does not belong to that class. We shall hold that the former opinion announces the law of this case, and we think the court below correctly interpreted the same when it submitted but the one issue to the jury. The record on the other appeal clearly disclosed the fact that the deeds from F. W. Robertson, by Love as agent, to Burleson and Wheeler & Owens were executed subsequent to the death of F. F. Robertson; and in view of this fact, when the Supreme Court held that the validity of sales made by Love was dependent upon whether they were made before or after the death of his ward, we conclude that court did not refer to the execution of the deeds, but rather to the time when the contracts of sale were made. The fifteenth assignment of error complains of the refusal of the court to charge the jury, at request of appellant, that the search made for the supposed bond for title to Wheeler <fe Owens, as shown by the evidence, was not in law sufficient, and that they should disregard all the evidence relating to it. Appellant did not object to the introduction of the testimony tending to show the execution, loss, and contents of the bond in question because sufficient search had not been made for it; and not having made such objection, we do not think he had the right, after the evidence was closed, to raise substantially that objection by a special charge. If the objection had been made to the testimony, and sustained, appellees might have produced the legal representative of Judge Renick, in whose custody this bond was last seen, and proved that it could not be found among his papers. What has already been said disposes of tne controlling questions in the case, and all of the assignments of error predicated upon the action of the District Court in giving and refusing charges, except the seventeenth, which, under the statute and rules, is too general. It merely charges that the court erred in adding a certain qualification to special charge No. 9 asked by appellant, without pointing out why such qualification was error. Was it because the testimony did not warrant the qualification, or was it because it was upon the weight of evidence ? A charge may be erroneous for several reasons, and an assignment of error challenging its correctness should assign a reason why it is alleged to be incorrect. There are several assignments of error based upon the ruling of the court in admitting or rejecting testimony, all of which refer to certain bills of exceptions, by number, for appellant’s reasons for claiming that the court erred. Nowhere in appellant’s brief are the reasons given for the assertions that the court committed error in the rulings referred to, and to ascertain why he charges error in these matters we are compelled to examine the bills of exceptions in the record. The rules are designed to enable appellate courts to decide cases without looking to the record, except where counsel for the parties differ as to what appears therein. Ordinarily an assignment of error ought to be complete in itself; and if it is not, and there is something else in the record essential to an intelligent ruling upon it, the latter ought at least to be embraced in the statement under the assignment. Under the statute and rules, the assignments referred to are insufficient, and will not be considered. Sup. Ct. Rules 24, 25; Bev. Stats., art. 1037. The last assignment of error complains of the action of the court in overruling appellant’s motion for a new trial, charging that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and the evidence, and that the jury were influenced by certain alleged improper conduct of one of appellee’s counsel. As stated in our finding of facts on the issues submitted to the jury, the testimony, though meager, supports the verdict. As to the other matter complained of, it appears that one of appellees’ counsel demanded the right to inspect and offer in evidence a certain written instrument shown to be in the custody of one of appellant’s counsel; that he was asked by appellant’s counsel to state his purpose for desiring to see and introduce the instrument in evidence; that he then stated that he expected to prove by the instrument that a part of, if not all, the land in controversy had been conveyed to appellant’s attorneys before this suit was brought; that while he was making this statement, one of appellant’s counsel objected to it being made in the hearing of the jury, charging that the statement was intended for the jury; that the objection was not heeded, and the statement completed; that appellant’s counsel then handed the paper to the court for inspection, and after reading it the bourt stated, in the hearing of the jury, that it was not a conveyance, was a private paper not admissible in evidence, and that the counsel would not be required to submit it ,to the inspection of others; that appellees’ counsel then, in a rather loud and authoritative tone, stated that he wished to inspect the paper for the purpose of preparing a bill of exceptions to the ruling of the court, and upon objection the request was refused. It also appears that appellees’ counsel, in addressing the jury, stated that the perseverance of appellant’s counsel, their manner of conducting the case, and what had transpired during the trial in the hearing of the jury, showed them to be largely interested in the result of the suit; and stated that appellant showed a grasping spirit in the manner of interrogating witnesses in reference to improvements. While there may have been some departure from that decorum which should always prevail in a court of justice, we do not believe that the conduct of appellees’ counsel, complained of by appellant, improperly influenced the jury. Besides, the statement of what he expected to prove by the written instrument was made at the request of one of appellant’s attorneys. If the tone of voice in which he demanded an inspection of the paper was in excess of the rules of propriety, we do not perceive why that fact should have influenced the jury against appellant. Delivered December 7, 1892. The judge states, in qualifying the bill of exception, that the language used in argument was not objected to at the time; and we do not think it was calculated to improperly influence a jury of ordinary honesty and intelligence. We have considered all the questions properly presented in appellant’s brief, and finding no reversible error, the judgment is affirmed. Affirmed.","THIRD DISTRICT, DECEMBER, 1892. Wm. F. Robertson v. George T. Coates et al. No. 10. 1. Trustee — Concurrent Remedies. — August 23,1858, F. W. Robertson, guardian of F. F. Robertson, executed a mortgage upon certain lands to his sureties on his bond as guardian, to secure them and to save harmless the ward. September, 1859, another guardian having been appointed, F. W. Robertson executed a power of attorney to such other guardian, empowering him to sell the lands mortgaged. October 24,1860, Love, the second guardian, obtained judgment against F. W. Robertson and his sureties upon his bond, and a decree foreclosing the mortgage. In 1862 Love, under his power of attorney, sold the land in controversy, which was included in the mortgage and decree of foreclosure. Subsequently the land was sold under the decree. In litigation between plaintiff, holding under the foreclosure, and defendants, holding under the deed by Love under the power of attorney, it was held that Love “ held united in himself as guardian all the right to sell which the power of attorney could give him, and also the privilege of having the land sold under the deed of foreclosure. Between these methods of converting the land into money he could choose, and by either he could convey a good title.” ' it follows that the purchaser under the foreclosure took nothing, the land having been sold under the power. 2. Power to Sell as Affected by Death of Constituent. — A contract to sell land made by an agent in the lifetime of his principal, and perfected after his death, is a valid execution of the power, and conveys the land. 3. Same Issue. — The main question raised in this case was adjudicated upon a former appeal (65 Texas, 37), upon a statement of facts showing substantially the same issues. See opinion. 4. Stare Decisis. — Cases are exceptional and of rare occurrence where a decision of an appellate court will be disregarded by a court of inferior rank. 5. Secondary Evidence of Lost Instrument — Search. —Where no objection is made to the testimony tending to show the execution, loss, and contents of a material document, because sufficient search had not been shown to find the original, the question of the competency of such testimony can not be raised by asking an instruction that the search was not sufficient. 6. Assignments of Error — Charge of Court. — An assignment of error attacking a charge should point out such error, and show wherein it is erroneous. 7. Practice in Supreme Court — Assignments of Error. — Ordinarily an assignment of error ought to be complete in itself; and if it is not, and there is something else in the record essential to an intelligent ruling upon it, the latter at least should be embraced in the statement in the brief under the assignment. 8. Conduct of Counsel in Trial Court. — See matters complained of in conduct of counsel on the trial held no ground for reversal on appeal. Appeal from McLennan. Tried below before Hon. A. J.

Burleson showed a good title to the part of the land claimed by them, and in charging the jury, in effect, that all the defendants (the others claiming under Wheeler & Owens) showed good titles, if a bond for title was made by Robertson through D. H. Love, guardian of F. F. Robertson, to Wheeler & Owens, prior to the death of F F. Robertson: because such was the law as expounded by this court upon a record the same, in substance, as to this point, and this court will adhere to the former decision. Robertson v.

Love, guardian, as plaintiff in the decree of foreclosure, with the powers of F. W. Robertson to sell, did convey a good title to Burleson and to Wheeler & Owens, the sale to Wheeler & Owens by title bond prior to the death of the minor being proved. Robertson v.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. Appellant sued appellee in trespass to try title for certain lands. The case was tried by the court without a jury, and judgment rendered in favor of appellee. We find the following to be the facts in this case as shown by the record: It is agreed that plaintiff has title to the land under conveyance, by decree and commissioners’ deed duly recorded February, 1889, executed September 4, 1888, and which conveys the title in A. Pope, M. J. Hall, and W. T. Scott, trustees; and defendant has title to the land by unrecorded deed from said Pope, Hall, and Scott, common source, executed January 12, 1863; and the question in the case as to title is, is the plaintiff an innocent purchaser without notice of said unrecorded deed? Plaintiff testified in his own behalf, by deposition: That he bought the land sued for and a large amount of other land for $20,000, cash paid by him on the approval of title by his attorneys, McLemore <& Campbell, of Galveston. That he was in Europe when he bought and paid for the land; that his attorneys examined and approved the title of record of the land sued for, and that he never was on the land, and neither personally nor by his attorneys made any inquiry as to whether there was any one in possession of said land, and he had no knowledge or information as to whether or not any one was on the land or claimed it at the time he bought and paid for said land. J. W. Skinner, witness for defendant, testified: 1 i That he is and has been secretary of the defendant since 1882, and manager of defendant’s ranch and pasture from 1882 to this time. That he is familiar with location of Southern Pacific survey number 205, sued for. It is within defendant’s pasture, and the fence that divides defendant’s pasture from one adjoining is on the line of the west side-of the said survey number 205. That this fence was built by one Butler, in 1885, who owned adjoining land, before defendant fenced its pasture, and defendant joined on and used this fence of Butler’s as part of its enclosure fence when it fenced, in the spring of 1886. That defendant’s pasture is well fenced with one smooth and three barbed wires, and the pasture contains about 28,000 acres, perhaps a little more, and there are no cross-fences, but is all one big pasture, except a small pasture around the ranch house. That part of west line fence belongs to Anson & Verner, whose lands are next-to defendant’s, and encloses Anson & Verner’s pasture also. That defendant claims all the land in the pasture fences aforesaid, as owner or lessee, except 800 acres, on which Cross has filed, and defendant has a contract with Cross to buy that land if he gets patent. <( There is also about 80 acres in this pasture owned by one Pruit, who lives on it, and defendant has no lease on it, and does not own or- claim to own it. That Pruit is postmaster of Yigo postoffice, which- he keeps on his said land; that Pruit has some milch cows, hogs, and two horses that run at large in the pasture, and defendant does not make any charge for Pruit so using the pasture; that witness thinks Pruit has a right to so use the pasture by reason of owning land thereon. That said pasture is about seven miles long by five or six miles wide. “ That defendant now and for many years has 'used this pasture exclusively for grazing cattle and horses, and has so used the same ever since said pasture fence was completed in the spring of 1886. “ Defendant owns and claims all the land enclosed in said pasture under deeds and leases, except Fruit’s 80 acres tract, on which Pruit lives, and has so claimed said land ever since the pasture was enclosed in 1886. I have been in the employ of defendant on said ranch since the date of its incorporation in 1883, and in the employ of De Renne, from whom the defendant bought the land in suit, since 1882, and said tract of land has been used continuously as part of said ranch for grazing horses and cattle on it ever since I have been on the ranch, and ever since said pasture was enclosed as part of defendant’s ranch and pasture. Defendant owns an interest in the fence built by Butler in 1885, on the west line of said tract of land as a division fence between Butler’s land and defendant’s land, and has owned an interest in said west line division fence since the pasture was enclosed in 1886. Defendant and De Renne have paid taxes on said land ever since 1883. ‘6 Neither plaintiff nor any agent for plaintiff has ever made any inquiry of me or of any one on the ranch about defendant’s title or possession of said land.” The above constitutes the entire facts as shown by the record. From these facts we conclude that the appellee had such possession of the land in controversy as would put the appellant upon notice of its title. An agreement in the statement of facts reduces the case to the one question of whether the defendant had such possession as to be constructive notice to appellant, as a subsequent purchaser, of the unrecorded deed under which appellee holds. Did the enclosure of the survey in question within the limits of the large pasture, and used by the appellee for pasturage purposes, constitute such possession as to confer constructive notice of the title under which it claimed ? Under facts showing possession similar to this case, it has been held in the cases of Taliaferro v. Butler, 77 Texas, 580, and Church v. Waggoner, 78 Texas, 201, that the possession by the owner of a large pasture of a smaller tract included within its limits, using it for grazing purposes in common with his lands within his enclosure, is such possession as will protect him under the statutes of limitation; and other elements of the statute being shown, he is entitled to recover under his pleas of limitation The rule announced in those cases we think decisive of the question before us. If such possession under these circumstances is held to be actual, continuous, and adverse, which must be the case in asserting a possession under the statutes of limitations, we think it is certainly sufficient to put a subsequent purchaser upon notice of the rights of the possessor of the land. The possession sufficient to constitute notice must be open, actual, and visible. No greater degree of certainty or notoriety is required in cases of this kind than exists in cases where the possession is asserted under the statues of limitations. We think the facts show such possession by appellee as was sufficient to put a subsequent purchaser upon inquiry as to its title. The judgment of the court below is affirmed. Affirmed.. Delivered February 15, 1893.","J. C. League v. The Buena Ventura Stock Company. No. 132.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. Appellees, on the 19tli of April, 1889, brought suit in the ordinary form of trespass to try title in the District Court of Wichita County, to recover of appellant a section of land, which resulted in a judgment in their favor, on the 8th day of November, 1889, from which this appeal is prosecuted. In December, 1873, W. W. Purinton brought suit in the District Court of Montague County against Thomas R. Odell, in an action of debt, and sued out a writ of attachment, which was levied upon the section of land in controversy and also upon another section of land, both situated in Wichita County. He alleged his residence to be in Grayson County, and that said Odell was a nonresident of the.State of Texas, and made the necessary affidavit to obtain service by publication, as well as a writ of attachment. The citation was duly published, in December, 1873, and January, 1874, in the Gainesville Gazette, a newspaper published in Cooke County, Texas, for four successive weeks prior to the return day, as shown by the return thereon, though the dates of publication were not stated. The citation commanded that it be served by making publication in some newspaper published in the county of Montague, if there should be a newspaper published in said county, but if not, then in the nearest county where a newspaper was published. The necessary attachment bond was duly executed, and the writ of attachment was levied on the 19th day of December, 1873. The defendant in the suit made no appearance, and in July, 1874, judgment was rendered against him in said court in the sum of 8512, foreclosing the attachment lien on said two sections of land and directing the clerk to issue an order of sale to the sheriff of Clay County, Texas, commanding him to seize and sell said property as under execution on the first Tuesday in September, 1874. This order of sale was duly issued as directed, and was executed by the sheriff of Clay County, who, after making due advertisement, sold said property to the highest bidder, before the court house door of Clay County, on the first Tuesday in September, 1874, for the aggregate sum of 8561.60, which satisfied the judgment, interest, and costs; the plaintiff Purinton being the successful bidder, to whom deed was made. On the 14tli day of August, 1875, by deed duly executed and recorded, Purinton conveyed the tract of land in controversy to C. F. Lucas, and thereafter, by warranty deed dated December 1, 1885, and duly recorded in Wichita County, said Lucas conveyed to appellant. Appellant never had actual possession of the land, but his vendor, Lucas, was in the possession and use of it from May 15, 1883, to May 15, 1886, and since May 15, 1886, it has not been occupied. It is agreed by the parties to this suit that the rents for these three years were worth 8192. We fail to find in the record any evidence as to what the considerations were for the deeds, first, from Purinton to Lucas, and, second, from Lucas to appellant. Appellant, in addition to his plea of not guilty, set up the statute of limitations of three years, and claimed reimbursement from appellees for the amount of the judgment satisfied by the sale of said land under the order of sale. Appellees, in reply to this claim, and against said judgment and lien, asserted the statute of limitation of two, four, and ten years. The cause was tried without a jury, but no conclusions of law and fact were filed. Appellees, through a quitclaim deed, showed title in themselves from Odell, the grantee and defendant in the original judgment. The title of appellant depends for support on the judgment rendered in Montague County, and the sale made thereunder in Clay County. Either the judgment or the sale must be declared void, as contradistinguished from voidable, in order to sustain the judgment appealed from. Our conclusion is, that the judgment can not be so declared. Many cases hold that a person who invokes the protection of a judgment rendered against a nonresident on attachment and publication proceedings must show affirmatively by the record that everything necessary to the jurisdiction was actually and rightly done. Other cases hold that the same presumptions will be indulged in support of such a judgment as where there has been personal service. The latter rule has been adopted by the Supreme Court of this State. Stewart v. Anderson, 70 Texas, 588; Tread-way v. Eastburn, 57 Texas, 209; Lawler v. White, 27 Texas, 250; Black on Judg., sec. 281. We will therefore presume that the sheriff of Montague County followed the command in the citation, .and published it in the newspaper of the nearest county, because there was no newspaper published in Montague, in the absence of proof to the contrary; and also that the requisite number of publications was made, though the return did not give the dates, but only stated that it had been published the four successive weeks before return day in the specified newspaper published in Cooke County. The failure to file a statement of facts after the court had obtained jurisdiction by attachment, and rendered judgment on service by publication, could not render the judgment void. This provision of the statute must have been intended to secure to the nonresident defendant the benefit of a review of the judgment in a direct proceeding. The law which prescribes the venue in suits against nonresidents seems to have been introduced with the Revised Statutes. We conclude, therefore, that appellees’ objections to the Montague judgment can not avail them on a collateral attack. The question raised as to the alleged invalidity of the sale is more difficult of solution. Appellees insist, that at the date of the sale, September, 1874, Wichita County, then unorganized, was not under the jurisdiction of Clay County, and hence that the sale by the sheriff of that county of land situated in Wichita must be held void, on the authority of those cases which hold that an execution sale of land made at any other place than the door of the court house of the county where the land is situated is a nullity. Their theory is, that as a result of an act of the Legislature passed in February, 1874, amending the thirteenth section of the Act of August 10,1870 (whereby Wichita, with other unorganized counties, had been attached for judicial purposes to Montague County), Wichita was left unattached for judicial purposes to any organized county, and that therefore it fell back to the jurisdiction of the county out of whose territory it had been originally created, and that the parent county was other than Clay. We are cited in support of this view to those cases which hold, that when a new county is created out of the territory of an organized county, it remains, to all intents and purposes, a part and parcel of the parent county until it is organized, or at least till the Legislature attaches it to some other county or district; and also to those decisions in which the expressions contained in the opinions indicate that this rule should be extended to cases where an unorganized county has been once attached to an organized county and the act attaching it has been repealed without attaching it to any other county. Lumpkin v. Muncey, 66 Texas, 311, and cases there cited; Alford v. Jones, 71 Texas, 519; Baker v. Beck, 74 Texas, 562; Merrill v. Roberts, 64 Texas, 445. The reason of the rule adopted in these cases is, in substance, stated to be, that every citizen is entitled to the benefits of civil government; and where there is no express law to the contrary, he may look to the courts and officers of the old county for protection till the new one is organized. Following the rule laid down in these cases, we have endeavored to trace the legislative history of Wichita County; and, with the facilities at our command, have been unable to find where it was ever carved out of the territory of an organized county. The present territory of Wichita County seems originally to have been included in the Fannin Land District, and subsequently, to-wit, by the Act of 1854, in the Cooke County Land District. Sayles’ Early Laws, art. 2422. In the year 1856 Young County was created, with a territory attached for judicial purposes which included the present area of Wichita. Ib., arts. 2519, 2559. The succeeding Legislature, on the 24th day of December, 1857, created the counties of Montague and Clay (lb., 2663, 2664), and on the 1st of February, 1858, the county of Wichita. Ib., 2705. In the act creating the county of Clay a territory was attached thereto for judicial and general purposes which included the present area of Wichita County. Ib., art. 2664. In the act creating Wichita and many other counties we find this provision: “ That until attached by law to some judicial district or .districts, each of said counties shall be attached, for judicial purposes, in matters pertaining to the jurisdiction of the District Court, to the nearest county in which the District Court may be held.” By an act passed in 1860, Wichita, with other counties, was attached to Montague for judicial purposes, with the provision that upon the organization of Clay County they should belong to Clay. Ib., art. 2883. This law was substantially re-enacted in 1866. Acts 1866, p. 94. By an act approved July 2, 1870, districting the State into judicial districts, Wichita and other unorganized counties were attached to the Twelfth Judicial District for judicial purposes, which district was composed of Montague and other counties. Acts 1870, p. 21. By an act approved August 10, 1870, fixing the times for holding District Courts in the several districts, in its thirteenth section, which fixed the time for the courts in said Twelfth District, it was further provided that for judicial purposes Clay, Wichita, and other counties should be attached to Montague; and in the last section all laws and parts of laws in conflict with said act were repealed. Ib., pp. 53, 59. It appears that in 1873 Clay County was organized; and in February, 1874, said thirteenth section of the Act of 1870 was amended by the substitution of a new section, which fixed the time for holding courts in the several counties of the Twelfth Judicial District, including the county of Clay, but did not attach the counties previously attached, including Wichita, to any organized county. Acts 1874, p. 7. It seems that when Clay County was organized it was the nearest county to Wichita in which a District Court was held, and that prior thereto Montague had been the nearest county. It seems also that the first Legislature which assembled after Clay County was organized, as well as the judge of the Twelfth Judicial District and the county officers in that section of the State, must have construed the previous legislation as placing the territory of Wichita County under the jurisdiction of Clay upon the organization of the latter; and we are not prepared to say that this construction was wrong. It is true that our Court of Appeals, in 1876, in the case of Holden v. The State, 1 Texas Court of Appeals, 234, in an elaborate and plausible opinion, held that the Act of 1870 repéaled the Act of 1866, by which it was provided that upon the organization of Clay County, Wichita and other counties should belong to Clay. We, however, doubt the correctness of that decision. The first ground upon which it was rested is, that as the Act of 1870 contained a repealing clause of all conflicting legislation, there was an express repeal, because the Act of 1866 only attached Wichita and other counties to Montague temporarily, till the organization of Clay, while the attachment of these and other counties to Montague by the Act of 1870 was apparently permanent. It seems to us that in both cases only a temporary status was intended to be effected, and that there was no conflict between the two acts. The other ground is, that there was an implied repeal, because the Acts of 1870 were subsequent statutes, revising the whole subject matter of the former one, and evidently intended as a substitute for it. The two Acts of 1870, districting the State and fixing times for holding courts under the Constitution of 1869, were evidently substitutes for the two similar acts of 1866, but the Act of 1866 in question was not one of these. Its scope was limited to the one purpose of attaching said counties. The doctrine of repeal by revision, even where there is no repugnance, is well settled, and is rested upon the presumption of a complete treatment of the subject embraced; but it seems also to be laid down as a part of this doctrine, that if the revising act (as in this instance) contains an express repeal of all inconsistent acts and parts of acts, there is an implication that if there are parts of former acts not embraced in the new act and not inconsistent, they are not repealed. South. on Stat. Const., secs. 154, 155; Lewis v. Stout, 22 Wis., 225; Gaston v. Merriam, 33 Minn., 271; 22 N. W. Rep., 620-621. As repeals by implication are not favored, in view of the inconvenience and litigation which seem to have resulted from the ruling, we doubt if any repeal of that part of the Act of 1866 which provided for the attachment of Wichita to Clay upon the organization of the latter should ever have been implied. It will be noted that the Act of 1874, amending the thirteenth section of the Act of August 10, 1870, left untouched the Act of July 2, 1870, which, among other things, contained the provision attaching Wichita for judicial purposes to the Twelfth District; unless, indeed, it should be held that that provision was so far rendered inoperative as to be repealed. Without announcing any definite conclusions on the repealing force of the acts of 1870 and 1874, we think that, beginning with the Seventh Legislature, which created the Clay territory, and out of this territory Wichita County, providing in the very act creating the county, by a general saving clause, for its attachment to the nearest organized county, if not elsewhere attached, there runs through the several enactments on the subject a legislative purpose that Wichita County, until organized, should fall under the jurisdiction of Montague and Clay in succession as the nearest organized counties; and construing this legislation as a whole,, we conclude that at the date of the sale the territory of Wichita was subject to the jurisdiction of Clay. If, however, it should be held that Wichita was not attached to Clay or any other organized county, it being without a parent county (unless, indeed, Clay should be deemed to stand in loco parentis), we conclude that the District Court of Montague County, having obtained jurisdiction of the property in controversy by a proceeding substantially in rem, had the power, in order to execute the decree of foreclosure, to designate some officer to make the sale at the time, place, and in the manner usual in foreclosure sales in this State; and that the sale made by the sheriff of Clay County, in accordance with the order of sale provided for in the decree, was not void, as would be an ordinary execution sale made in violation of a mandatory statute. These conclusions have not been reached without hesitation, but until we can point to a place other than Clay County where the sale was directed by law to be made — and upon this subject appellees have furnished us no information — we are unwilling to declare it void. It seems to us that the principle announced in the cases which sustain the jurisdiction of the parent county, where there is no provision for jurisdiction elsewhere, should have application here. Delivered November 15, 1892. It is therefore concluded that the judgment of the court below should be reversed, and that judgment should be here rendered for appellant jReversed and rendered. A motion for rehearing in this case was overruled.","H. T. Buse v. Mahlon Bartlett et al. No. 16. 1. Judgment Against Nonresident — Presumptions Indulged. — In this State the same presumptions as to jurisdiction and regularity of proceedings are indulged in favor of the judgment rendered against a nonresident on attachment and service by publication, as in favor of such judgment when there has been personal service. 2. Same — Failure to File Statement of Facts. — The failure to ñle a statement of facts after the court had obtained jurisdiction by attachment and rendered judgment on service by publication, could not render the judgment void, this provision of the statute being intended to secure to the nonresident defendant the benefit of a review of the judgment in a direct proceeding. 3. Unorganized Counties —Act of 1866 Attaching Wichita for Judicial Purposes not Repealed. — The Act of November ti. IS ti. attached Wichita to Montague for judicial purposes, and provided also that it should become attached to Clay when the latter organized; and this latter provision was not repealed by the Act of August 10,1870, attaching Wichita to Montague, and the act amendatory thereof of February 13,1884, which failed to attach Wichita to any organized county. 4. Case not Followed— Implied Repeals. — The case of Holden v. The State, 1 Texas Court of Appeals, 239, holding that said Act of 1866 was impliedly repealed by the subsequent legislation, is not followed. When a general revising act expressly repeals all inconsistent acts and parts of acts, this implies that if there are parts of former acts (as in this case) not embraced in the new act, and not inconsistent therewith, they are not repealed. 5. Proceedings In Rem — Foreclosure Sale by Commissioner.— When the District Court has obtained jurisdiction of the property in controversy by a proceeding substantially in rem, it has the power, in order to execute the decree of foreclosure, to designate some officer to make the sale at the time, place, and in the manner usual in foreclosure sales in this State; and a sale made accordingly is not void, as would be an ordinary execution sale made in violation of a mandatory statute.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This is an action by the heirs of James Bowie, the original petitioners and interveners, all in the attitude of plaintiffs, against the Houston & Texas Central Eailway Company, Charles Dillingham, Nelson S. Easton, and James Eintoul, defendants, to recover 1920 acres of land in one survey and 177 acres in another, both in Hardeman County, Texas, and both located by virtue of genuine certificates issued to the heirs of James Bowie. Both surveys are described by metes and bounds in the petition, and it is alleged, that “ defendants in some manner have obtained from the General Land Office of Texas patents on certain surveys claimed by them, which cover part of the lands sued for; that defendants had no legal surveys or locations in conflict with the James Bowie survey, and said patents were improperly issued and cast a cloud upon the title of the heirs of Bowie.” Prayer that the title of plaintiffs and intervenors be established and quieted, that they recover the land from defendants, and that the patents, in so far as they conflict with the lands of the heirs sued for, be cancelled. Venue was changed to Travis County. Defendants answered by plea of not guilty; deny that there is any conflict between the lands claimed by them and plaintiffs, but that if there be any conflict, it “is in part only, and conflicts very slightly with plaintiffs’ land.” Defendants also disclaimed title to all the surveys known as the even-numbered surveys made by defendant company in Hardeman County for the public free school fund; and also disclaimed number 19, block 44, it having been sold to Jackson & Smith, of Jefferson, Missouri. Judgment was rendered by the court for plaintiffs and intervenors for the land sued for, that their title be established, and that all claim of title held by defendants to any of such land be cancelled, etc. Defendants appealed. Plaintiffs and intervenors proved, that the land in suit was located by valid certificates issued to the heirs of James Bowie, and that the surveys were made by the district surveyor of Jack County on the 11th and 28th days of November, 1874, and properly returned to the General Land Office. It was also proved that the plaintiffs and intervenors were the heirs of James Bowie. Defendants’ surveys were made in alternate sections for the defendant railway company by the district surveyor of Jack Land District, on December 18, 1873, and were duly and properly returned to the General Land Office, the alternate odd-numbered sections for the company and the even numbers for the public school fund. Defendants’ surveys were patented in 1877, except one in 1881. Plaintiff offered in evidence a Land Office copy of a part of a map, duly certified by the Commissioner to be a correct copy of sketch number 14-J- in Hardeman County, which is certified to be a record of the office and in use by the office, which indicates the railroad lands by black lines, and the lands located for the James Bowie heirs by red and yellow double lines. The map clearly shows that the 1900 acres surveyed for the heirs of James Bowie covers all of section 20 and parts of sections 19, 21, 12, 18, 17, 36, 37, and 38, surveyed by the railway company for itself and the public school fund. The lands of the railway and those of the school fund are in a solid block; the land of the Bowies lies upon top of them so as to include number 20 and parts of other surveys as stated. It also shows that the Bowie labor includes parts of numbers 51, 52, and 527, surveyed for the railway company and the school fund. Plaintiffs offered no testimony to show the conflict except the map or sketch from the Land Office, and the important question in the case, properly raised by assignment of error, is as to the competency of the testimony—the map—to prove the conflict. The surveys of the railway company were made prior to those made for the Bowie certificates, the former in December, 1873, and the latter in November, 1874. But the surveys made for the company were invalid, because they were made by the district surveyor of Jack Land District at a time when Hardeman County, in which the lands were situated, was not a part of that district, but was a part of the Clay Land District. In November, 1874, when the Bowie surveys were made, Hardeman County was a part of the Jack Land District, having been by act of the Legislature detached from the Clay District. General Laws of Texas, 1873, Act to create and define Clay Land District, p. 150; General Laws of Texas, 1874, Act to define land districts of Palo Pinto, Jack, Clay, Young, and Eastland, sec. 2, p. 162; Cox v. Railway, 68 Texas, 226. Appellants have no assignment of error on this point, assuming, as it seems, that plaintiffs have title to the land sued for. We have noticed it because it is a necessary part of this case. The surveys for the Bowie certificates were- made before the patents issued to the railway company, and secured rights in the land superior to those of defendant. The certified copy from a sketch in use in the General Land Office was-admissible in evidence. It was not a plat made by a draughtsman from field notes and records in the office, as in the case of Railway v. Thompson, 65 Texas, 193, but a copy of an archive—a map in use in the office. Rev. Stats,, arts. 57, 2252; Smith v. Hughes, 23 Texas, 249; Boon v. Hunter, 62 Texas, 589. It may not have been competent for the certificate of the officer to state-that the sketch correctly shows the position of Bowie surveys and of those-made for the railway company, but the certificate was sufficient in other respects to admit the copy from the map. The court below declined to receive as evidence that part of the certificate declaring that the map correctly showed the relative positions of the surveys, but accepted the copy of the map itself as evidence of the fact. The map was evidence; the certificate was not—it was only the unsworn opinion of the Commissioner. The map was sufficient of itself, there being no contradictory testimony, to establish the facts shown by it, that there was a conflict of the Bowie surveys with the surveys claimed by defendants, as well as others indicated thereon and figuring in the case. The court below rested his conclusion as to conflict upon the map, as he should have done, in the absence of opposing testimony. , Defendants can not complain because the court rendered judgment against them for all the land sued for. The disclaimer of a part of the land sued for did not affect the issue as to the parts they did claim under their plea of not guilty. Had they disclaimed all the land sued for, the question would be different. Their denial of the alleged conflict was not a disclaimer. The denial, however, admitted that if there was a conflict, it was very slight. The denial did not establish the fact. The issue under their plea of not guilty as to conflict was still left in the case for trial by the court. The evidence showed a conflict with lands claimed by them, and judgment was accordingly rendered against them. Plaintiffs showed superior title in themselves to all the land sued for, defendants claiming only a part of it by patents, clouding the title, and it was proper to render judgment for plaintiffs for all the land. The owners of other surveys in conflict with plaintiffs’ land, disclaimed by defendants, were not affected by the judgment. So far as costs are concerned, we do not see from the record that they are increased by the fact that defendants’ surveys only conflicted in part with the land of plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’ recovery was for all the surveys sued for, as it ought to have been. We have disposed of every material assignment of error in the foregoing, and find no error in the judgment of the court below, and it is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 15, 1893. Justice Key did not sit in this case. _","Houston & Texas Central Railway Company v. Heirs of James Bowie. No. 133. 1. Surveys—Case Adhered to. — Cox v. Railway Company, 68 Texas, 226, adhered to, that surveys made by the district surveyor of Jack Land District, of land in Hardeman County while it was part of Clay Land District, are invalid and did not appropriate the land. 2. Land Office Maps as Evidence — Archives. — Certified copies of maps in use in the Land Office, and archives of the office, are competent as evidence showing conflict of surveys placed upon such maps in the Land Office. Such map not being contradicted or shown to be inaccurate, is sufficient evidence of such conflict. 3. Disclaimer—Costs, Recovery of Part.—In trespass to try title and to cancel patents conflicting with the patent under which plaintiffs hold, the defendants disclaimed as to part of the land sued for, and pleaded not guilty. Recovery was had of part of the land sued for to which was pleaded not guilty. Meld, that judgment for plaintiffs for all the costs was not error. Appeal from Travis. Tried below before Hon. W. M. Key. T. D. Cobbs, for appellant. 1. The court erred in permitting plaintiffs, over the objection of defendants, to introduce in evidence the map from the General Land Office, for the purpose of proving a conflict of the plaintiffs’ and defendant’s lands, there being no other evidence introduced to locate the particular place, locality, and, identity of the lands, either of plaintiffs or defendants, or where the lands of either were located in Hardeman County.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. Emmott Brothers, doing business at Denison, Texas, made a chattel mortgage upon their entire stock in trade to their friend, H. G. Symonds, to secure certain promissory notes held by their sister and bookkeeper, E. Louise Emmott, against them, and an attorney fee charged for the preparation of the instrument. The goods were seized under attachment process and appropriated by Waples, Platter & Co. to the payment of a debt due them from said firm. From a judgment against them and the officer who levied the writ, as well as against certain sureties, for the value of the goods, this appeal is prosecuted. Appellants made the issue, that the mortgage had been executed with intent to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of' Emmott Brothers, disputing the validity and amount of the debts secured. In submitting this issue to the jury, the following, among other charges of which appellants complain, were given: ‘1 Fourth. The chattel mortgage read in evidence gave to the plaintiff the right to the control and possession of the property therein mentioned for the purposes set forth in such mortgage, unless you find and believe from the evidence that the debts mentioned in said mortgage, and to secure the payment of which the same was executed, were, either in whole or in part, simulated, false, and fictitious. “ Fifth. A debtor in failing circumstances has the right to transfer his property to a creditor to whom such debtor owes a real, actual, valid, and subsisting debt; and such transfer will not be regarded as fraudulent, even though the creditor knew that the debtor had made the same with the intent to defraud his creditors; in other words, a debtor may convey to his creditor or to some one in trust for such creditor, even though the debtor be insolvent, property sufficient to pay off the debt of such creditor, although the creditor knows that the same is done with a fraudulent intent on the part of the debtor, and although by such transfer other creditors are not protected, provided that the creditor for whose benefit the transfer is made holds against the debtor a real, genuine indebtedness.” That these charges were erroneous and will require a reversal of the judgment, is made apparent by the following proposition of appellants, which we believe to be sound, to-wit: “ When the pleading and the evidence fairly raise the issue as to whether a conveyance of personal property, made by an insolvent creditor in trust to secure a debt, is made for the purpose of hindering, delaying, and defrauding creditors, and the evidence tends to show participation in the fraud on the part of the secured creditor, any charge which makes the validity of the instrument depend solely upon whether or not the claim secured is a bona fide debt is error.” If the doctrine announced in the charge be the law, then may a failing debtor who has embarked in business on the borrowed capital of a relative, as seems to be claimed in this case, be enabled to steer clear of the ordinary perils of business by making a conveyance of his stock in trade to a friend to secure the debt of the relative, and at the same time tp fraudulently hinder and delay other creditors till their debts can be compromised, or the business enterprise be renewed in some other name. While it may be both kind and natural for a sister to aid a brother in this way, it is not believed to be the law. But for the fact that the appellants in the manner of pleading seem to have assumed the burden of proof on the issue as to the validity of the alleged debts, the second paragraph of the charge might require a reversal of the judgment. Tillman v. Heller, 78 Texas, 597. On account of the error announced in the fourth and fifth charges and applied in subsequent portions of the charge, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded. Bevei'sed and remanded,. Delivered March 16, 1893. Justice Head did not sit in this case.","A. W. Mixon et al. v. H. G. Symonds et al. No. 121. Conveyance in Fraud of Creditors — Knowledge of Fraudulent Intent.—A conveyance of property by an insolvent debtor to secure one of his creditors, made also with intent to delay and defraud his other creditors, is not valid if the secured creditor participates in the debtor’s fraudulent intent, although the claim secured is a bona fide debt. Appeal from Grayson. Tried below before Hon. P. B. Muse. Head & Dillard, I. M. Stanifer, and A. G. Moseley, for appellants.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Appellee T. C. Wilson sued C. W. Israel- & Co., in the District Court of Wichita County, for a debt amounting to $2818.85, and on the 16th day of December made affidavit and gave bond to obtain writs of garnishment against J. T. Craig, the State National-Bank of Fort Worth, and the City National Bank of Fort Worth; and on the 30th day of December, 1887, plaintiff filed an additional affidavit and application to obtain a writ of garnishment against appellant, D. D. Swearingen, whose residence was alleged to be in Hardeman County, Texas; but to obtain this garnishment no additional bond was given. Appellant first filed his motion to quash the garnishment against him upon several grounds, among which was the failure of appellee to give bond at the time the garnishment against him was sued out. This motion does not appear from the transcript to have been acted upon, unless the following entry therein should be taken as a part of the record to show that this had been done, to-wit: “ 182. T. C. Wilson v. D. D. Swearingen, garnishee. Cobb & Boyd. Motion to quash writ of garnishment and dismiss suit. November 12, 1890,. Overruled 5d 3 w.” On April 24, 1888, appellant answered the writ of garnishment, and after denying any indebtedness to defendants, or either of them, in the usual form, added to his answer the following: “ Defendant D. D. Swearingen, the garnishee herein, further answering, says, that on or about the-day of May, 1886, he purchased from one John Craig, who was acting as assignee of C. W. Israel & Co., or J. N. Israel and C. W. Israel, certain bank fixtures for the sum of $800, and thereupon gave his promissory note for said sum, payable to said John A. Craig as assignee of C. W. Israel & Co , or J. N. Israel and C. W. Israel. That said note was not payable until all litigation between John A. Craig as assignee and the creditors of said bank was settled. Defendant says that he does not know who is now the owner of said note herein referred to, but is informed that said note has been transferred by said Craig to other parties. Wherefore he asks that the said John Craig, as assignee as aforesaid, who is a resident of Clay County, Texas, be made a party to this proceeding, and that citation issue to him commanding him to appear and answer whether or not he as assignee is the owner of said note, and' if not, then to answer who is the owner of said note. Defendant asks that he be allowed a fee of $50 as attorney fee for preparing an answer in this proceeding.” The record does not show that Craig was ever served with citation or appeared in the case. On the 19th of November, 1890, judgment was rendered against the garnishee for the sum of $770, with interest from the 14th of February, 1886, at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, aggregating the sum of $1135.75, and in favor of appellant for all costs, including the $50 attorney fee claimed in his answer, and adjudging that this judgment be a bar in his favor against all liability upon his debt to C. W. Israel & Co. This judgment recites that both plaintiff and garnishee appeared by their attorneys, and that all matters of fact as well as of law were submitted to the court, and the court, after hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, and being fully advised in the premises, finds that the garnishee D. D. Swearingen was indebted to C. W. Israel & Co. as above set forth. No affidavit seems ever to have been filed controverting the answer of the garnishee, nor does it appear affirmatively from the record that any issues, either written or verbal, were made up under the direction of the court, as required by the statute. It does not appear from the record that the garnishee ever made any objection to the’trial of the case in Wichita County on account of his residence in Hardeman. Ho statement of facts or special findings accompany the record. We are of opinion that the purported copy in the transcript from the motion docket should not be treated as a part of the record. In the case of Stark v. Miller, 63 Texas, 164, it is said: “ The judge’s notes are for his own convenience and that of the clerk making the entries, and form no part of the record, and in case of a discrepancy between these notes and an entry in the minutes, the latter would prevail.” Whittaker v. Gee, 63 Texas, 435; Eastham v. Sallis, 60 Texas, 576. We think the only effect that should be given to this entry would be to enable the parties to have an order entered nunc pro tune showing the action of the court upon this motion. Ximenes v. Ximenes, 43 Texas, 458. The record not showing that the motion was called to the attention of the court below, or that any objection was insisted upon by the garnishee to the alleged irregularities in obtaining the garnishment, it will not be necessary for us to consider several interesting questions presented by the brief of appellant. The action of the court in proceeding with the trial of this case without requiring the issues to be formed as required by the statute certainly presents grave irregularities, but we are not prepared to hold that they are such as must be deemed fatal to the judgment. It seems that appellant entered into the trial without making any objection on account of the failure of appellee to file a controverting affidavit, and without taking any steps to have formal issues made. The contest seems to have been waged not to test the truth or falsity of any of the statements made in the answer of the garnishee, but only to show that by reason of the facts therein stated the note therein named as due to Craig, assignee, should be held liable for the debts of the assignor C. W. Israel & Co., and in such case it does not seem to us that a controverting affidavit would be necessary. Appellee did not controvert any of the statements made in the answer, and he therefore could not have sworn that the answer of the garnishee was not correct. See Moursund v. Priess, 84 Texas, 554. The failure to form the issues before entering into the trial, however, presents a more difficult question. It has been held that our statute in such cases does not require formal pleadings (Insurance Company v. Willis & Bro., 70 Texas, 12; Davis & Bro. v. McCormick, 2 Willson’s Civil Cases, 628); and it has also been held that these issues may by consent be joined verbally and need not be in writing (Kelly v. Gibbs, 84 Texas, 143); and after a careful consideration of the question we are of opinion, that under the recitals in this judgment we ought to presume that the parties did by consent form the necessary verbal issues to sustain it, and that appellant having gone through the trial without objecting to the manner of proceeding, should not now be heard to complain that the record fails to show that the necessary issues were made. It was as much •his duty to see that the necessary issues were formed as it was that of his adversary. We think it clear that the objection that the trial was had in a county other than that of the residence of appellant comes too late when presented for the first time in this court. Bonner & Eddy v. Hearne, 75 Texas, 251. We are therefore of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 24, 1893. A motion for rehearing was refused.","D. D. Swearingen v. T. C. Wilson. No. 75. 1. Becord on Appeal—Entry on Motion Docket below no Part of.—The judge’s notes are for his own convenience and that of the clerk, and an entry on the motion docket in the court below forms no part of the record on appeal, although a purported copy thereof appears in the transcript. Where the record does not show otherwise than by copy of such entry that a motion was called to the attention of the court below, an alleged order overruling such motion will not he reviewed on appeal. 2. Garnishment—Controverting Affidavit.—An affidavit by plaintiff controverting the answer of the garnishee is not necessary, where the issue is not as to the truth or falsity of the facts set forth in the answer, but only as to the legal liability of the garnishee on the facts as therein stated. 3. Garnishment Trial Without Issues Formed—Presumption.— Where it does not appear from the record that any issues, either written or verbal, were made up in a garnishment trial, but the judgment recites that both plaintiff and garnishee appeared by their attorneys, and that all matters of fact as well as of law were submitted to the court, it will be presumed that the parties did, by consent, form the necessary verbal issues, and the garnishee can not complain for the first time on appeal that the record does not show that such issues were made. 4. Garnishment—Objection as to Venue Waived.—Objection that the trial in a garnishment proceeding was bad in a county other than that of the garnishee’s residence, comes too late on appeal.

"KEY, Associate Justice. The appellees in this case have filed a mo- tion seeking to strike from the files and have this court refuse to consider the transcript filed by the appellants, upon the grounds: 1. That the record shows four separate and distinct judgments of four separate and distinct cases. 2. Because the caption does not refer to or name either one of the causes, the record of which is presented and transcript filed. 3. Because the certificate of the clerk only refers to three of the causes tried, and does not embrace the principal case disclosed by the record. 4. Because the clerk’s endorsement upon said transcript does not show for whom the transcript was applied and for whom it was delivered. The appellants resist this motion, upon the grounds: 1. That the motion is too late, because the Supreme Court granted leave to file the transcript. 2. Because it is claimed that the appellees, in signing the waiver of time for filing tlie transcript, have waived their right to object to the transcript that is filed. 3. They claim that there is no merit in the motion, as the record shows that all of said causes have been consolidated. The record shows that on the 23rd day of June, 1890, the District Court of El Paso County made an order consolidating nine several causes, and ordered that they be tried as one cause, to-wit, Charles E. Fruin v. George Paul et al., file No. 1319; Momsen and Thorn v. George Paul et al., file No. 1320; William Cameron & Co. v. George Paul et al., file No. 1322; O. T. Bassett v. Charles E. Fruin et al., file No. 1323; Burton, Lingo & Co. v. George Paul et al., file No. 1324; T. M. Cooney v. George Paul et al., file No. 1325; Davis and Rogers v. Anson Mills et al., file No. 1327; Berla & Co. v. Anson Mills et al., file No. 1340; George Paul v. Anson Mills et al., file No. 1326; and that all of said parties in said several suits file their pleadings in this cause under file No. 1319; and that all the rights of said secondary parties be adjusted in this said cause. This order was made in cause No. 1319, Charles E. Fruin v. George Paul et al., and was made upon the application of the appellants in this cause, and embraces the four causes shown by the record to' have been tried in said court. At the February term, 1892, four of the cases embraced in the foregoing order of consolidation, to-wit, William Cameron & Co. v. George Paul et al., file No. 1322; O. T. Bassett v. Charles E. Fruin et al., file No. 1323; T. M. Cooney & Co. v. George Paul et al., file No.-; George Paul et al. v. Anson Mills, J. F. Crosby, and Josephine Crosby, file No.-, were tried, and separate verdicts returned, and separate judgments entered in each of said causes. The trial (or trials) was had upon separate petitions of each set of plaintiffs, but on one answer, so prepared as to constitute an answer to each petition. The court gave separate charges applicable to each case. Thereafter a motion for a new trial was filed in the cause of Charles E. Fruin v. George Paul et al., stating that the defendants, Anson Mills, J. E. Crosby, and Josephine Crosby, moved the court to set aside the verdicts and judgments rendered in the following causes consolidated and tried with this cause, viz., George Paul v. Anson Mills et al., No. 1326; O. T. Bassett v. Charles E. Fruin et al., No. 1323; William Cameron & Co. v. George Paul et al., No. 1322, and T. M. Cooney & Co. v. George Paul et al., No. 1325. This motion being overruled, defendants gave notice of appeal. The statement of facts was prepared and filed by the district judge in cause of Charles E. Fruin v. George Paul et al., No. 1319, and certain causes consolidated therewith. The appellants’ assignment of errors is filed in the same cause, and assigns errors committed in the trial of the foregoing four cases, giving their styles and numbers, as consolidated and tried together. The appellants filed four supersedeas and appeal bonds in cause No. 1319, of Charles E. Fruin v. George Paul et al., each reciting that, “ Whereas, in the above styled and numbered cause, and causes consolidated therewith, pending, in said District Court of El Paso county, Texas, the plaintiff [giving the name of the plaintiff] had recovered judgment against defendants in said cause,” etc. The clerk’s certificate at the end of the transcript reads as follows: “ State of Texas, County of El Paso. — I, J. A. Escajeda, clerk of the District Court in and for El Paso County, Texas, do hereby certify that the foregoing pages are a true and correct transcript of all papers, orders, decrees, and proceedings had in the District Court of El Paso County, Texas, in causes Nos. 1322, 1323, 1324, and 1326, wherein William Cameron & Co., plaintiffs, v. George Paul et al., defendants; O. T. Bassett, plaintiff, v. Charles E. Fruin et al., defendants; T. M. Cooney & Co., plaintiffs, v. George Paul et al., defendants, as the same, with other causes, were consolidated as one Cause, under No. 1319, where Charles E. Fruin, plaintiff, v. George Paul et al., defendants, together with a correct and true bill of costs herein.” This certificate is properly signed and has the seal attached. While the judgments themselves do not show it, it is admitted in appellees’ motion that the four cases were tried at the same time and -before the same jury; but inasmuch as the record shows separate charges, verdicts, and judgments, we believe that, for the purposes of an appeal, they must be treated as separate and distinct trials. If this is not true, then, treating the order of consolidation as in force at the time of the trials, it appears that there is no final judgment in the case; because the judgments rendered in the court below do not dispose of the other five cases, and the rights of the parties therein, with which these four were consolidated. Martin v. Crow, 28 Texas, 614; Simpson v. Bennett, 42 Texas, 241; Linn v. Arambould, 55 Texas, 611; Mignon v. Brinson, 74 Texas, 18. However our attention may be called to the fact, if the record discloses that no final judgment has been rendered in a cause, then this court is compelled to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction; and sustaining the motion before us has the same effect. If it be true that the order of consolidation was in force at the time of the trial, and the other parties to the consolidated suit had not withdrawn or been dismissed from the case or otherwise disposed of, then the proceedings of the court below — from which this appeal is sought to be prosecuted — did not constitute a final judgment; and while without acquiring jurisdiction of the case we have no authority to direct how the District Court should proceed, yet if it be a fact that there has been no final judgment rendered, then in law the consolidated case should be proceeded with and tried in the District Court as though there had never been any trial therein. Delivered November 2, 1892. It follows, therefore, that the first ground of the motion is well taken; and inasmuch as the certificate of the clerk undertakes to enumerate the several causes tried, and omits the case of George Paul v. Anson Mills, Josiah F. Crosby, and Josephine Crosby, except by giving its file number, it must also be held that the third ground of the motion is well taken. Sup. Ct. Rules 90, 96. We do not think that appellees are precluded from making this motion by their action as stated in the appellants’ answer to the motion. All that they did was to sign a' paper admitting that the facts stated in the appellants' motion to be allowed to file transcript after the time required by law, excusing themselves for not filing the same, were true, and consenting that appellants might file a transcript and their briefs at a later day than that permitted by the rules. They did not consent to the filing of any particular transcript. -Nor did the Supreme Court, in granting appellants permission to file transcript at a later day than required by law, give permission to file this particular transcript. For the reasons above stated, the motion to strike out the transcript filed by appellants on the 25th day of June, 1892, will be granted, and the appeal herein dismissed. Dismissed.","THIRD DISTRICT, NOVEMBER, 1892. Anson Mills et al. v. George Paul et al. Motion No. 17. 1. Practice on Appeal —Want of Final Judgment. — However the attention of the court be called to the fact, if the record discloses that no final judgment has been rendered in a cause, the appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. 2. Final Judgment. — Several causes are shown to have been consolidated in the trial court. A judgment in such consolidated case, to be final, must dispose of the litigation as to all the parties in such suit. See example. 3. Certificate of Clerk to Transcript. — In an appeal taken from a judgment in a case in which several cases had been consolidated, the clerk in his certificate to the transcript omitted several of the cases, while purporting to give all the cases. Such defect appearing, was ground for striking the transcript from the files of the court. 4. Waiver. — That the Supreme Court permitted the transcript to be filed, and the parties had agreed thereto, after the time required by law, did not preclude action upon defects in the transcript requiring its dismissal. Appeal from El Pasp. Motion to dismiss. M. W. Stanton, for appellants. Patterson & Buckler, for appellees."
"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This is the second appeal of this case; the former is reported in 70 Texas, 582, to which we refer for statement of the case as there presented. The case went to trial again upon the same amended petition upon which it was submitted before, and an amendment styled a trial amendment. On the last trial there was verdict and judgment thereon for plaintiffs Mrs. Kuehn, now Mrs. Nolte, for §1500, and the two minor children, Willie Kuehn and Herman Kuehn, for §2000 each, or §5500 in all. Defendant has appealed. The first assigned error is, that the court erred in overruling defendant’s general demurrer to the petition, as amended by the trial amendment filed November 20, 1889, because it shows no cause of action. The fifth assignment of error is to the effect, that the court erred in overruling defendant’s special demurrers to plaintiffs’ pleadings, because they do not show proper precaution to prevent injury to deceased. Both of these assignments will be considered together. On the former appeal it was held, that the petition upon which the trial was had (the same now before us, the second amended petition, filed December 8,1885), was good. Before the last trial, on November 20,1889, plaintiffs filed what is styled a substitute for trial amendment, in which it is alleged that defendant and its servants saw deceased Kuehn attempting to cross the railway in ample time to have checked and stopped the train, prevented the accident, and saved the life of deceased, but that defendant moved on at a rapid rate, regardless of his safety, and failed and neglected to stop the train, although it could have done so. That Kuehn did not see the train until he was ascending the steep to cross the road, and at a time when he could not with safety turn to the right or left, and could not stop with safety. It was also alleged, that the place where the road crossed was level before the railway was built, ‘1 and that the company failed and neglected to leave the crossing in as good order as it was, or as it might have been.” These allegations were made in addition to those of the amended petition. In that petition it was shown that plaintiff was compelled to drive his wagon over the railway at the crossing in order to reach his home; “ that the crossing was within the corporate limits of the city of New Braunfels, and the ordinances of the city required trains at that point not to exceed in speed the rate of six miles an hour, and that defendant had placed a sign board to that effect at the corporate limits,’ ’ and the following: “ On the said 27th day of February, 1883, at the point of intersection of the Seguin and New Braunfels road and defendant’s railway there was a wagon-crossing, which was constructed in an unskillful and negligent manner, and the top of the roadbed at said point of intersection was greatly above the level of the wagon road, and the dirt approaches to the wagon-crossing were unusually and excessively steep and very difficult of ascent, and an unusual and unnecessary period of time was required for heavy vehicles to cross said track; and defendant had carelessly and negligently erected ditches, cattle guards, and fences on the side of the said crossing, so as to render the same very narrow, and dangerous for vehicles to back or turn to avoid a train of cars.” Other allegations are made, showing the collision, the injury, and such facts as would complete the statement of the case. Taking all the allegations upon the subject in the amended petition and the trial amendment, it can not be said that they show a case of contributory negligence on the part of deceased that would certainly prevent a recovery by plaintiffs, or that deceased failed to exercise such care as the occasion demanded. The amended petition on which the first trial was had was on former appeal held to be good. The additional fact set up in the trial amendment, that deceased saw the train while ascending the way to the crossing, when he could not turn to the right or left or stop with safety, does not conclusively show that the collision was caused by his negligence. His position and all his surroundings calling for care on his part must be considered. The steep and narrow approach, the danger of his wagon running backward if he stopped, the impossibility of turning with safety, the speed of the approaching train as he may have presumed it to be according to the averment made, are all facts to be considered in connection with the time he is alleged to have seen the train. The distance of the train from him at the time he saw it is not stated. It may be the jury, upon the facts, will conclude that he was guilty of contributory negligence in driving on after he discovered the train, but we are not prepared to say they could not do otherwise under the facts as stated. It is not always negligence to cross a railway track at a regular crossing in front of a moving train. All the facts and necessities of the occasion, the responsibility therefor, the knowledge or means of knowledge of the person charged with negligence, are to be considered in deciding the question. The petition presented a question for the jury if the facts stated are true, and not one that should be decided by the court on demurrer. Before the trial plaintiffs filed a motion to exclude parts of the answer of defendant’s witness Jones, on the ground that the question suggested the answer, and assumed that the bridge was crossed, the bell rung, and the whistle blown. The answer of the witness was, that the train made a good deal of noise [crossing the bridge] and ringing the bell [and in the usual travel along the road]. The court struck out the portions of the answer in the above brackets. Defendant excepted, and assigns error, that the question did not suggest the answer or assume the facts as stated. There was an issue as to whether the bell was rung or the whistle blown; no dispute about crossing the bridge. The court allowed the only-part of the answer that was subject to the objection, and which should have been stricken out, to stand and to be read to the jury. Appellant insists that there was error in admitting, over defendant’s objections, that part of witness Bartlett’s answer to the seventh direct interrogatory, because the witness answered matter that was not responsive to the question asked. The witness was testifying by deposition. The objection was made on the trial, and not by motion before announcement. The objection, as stated in the assignment, was to the form and manner of taking the deposition, and could not be made except by motion filed before announcement for trial. There was an issue as to whether Kuehn died of the injuries received in the collision with the train or of Bright’s disease, Mrs Nolte, formerly Mrs. Kuehn, was allowed to testify, over objection of defendant, that Kuehn complained of his wound from the time of the collision up to the time of his death. Error is assigned to the ruling, because his complaints are hearsay, and that he was making evidence for himself. The rule is, that complaints of existing suffering and exclamations of present pain are admissible as res gestee. If the complaints were made .after Kuehn had brought this suit for damages, or after the litigation was in view, they would not be admissible. 1 Whart. Ev., sec. 268, and authorities cited; 1 Greenl. Ev., secs. 102, 100. There was no error in admitting testimony that there were trees near defendant’s right of way, or other obstructions preventing or interfering with the view of the train from the road where Kuehn was, whether the facts were alleged or not. There was error in refusing to exclude the answer of the witness Beu • stedt, that “they [the persons operating the train] could have stopped and not have hit the wagon had they driven slower.” The witness was not an expert; his answer was an invasion of the province of the jury. It was not error to allow proof of how much cotton and corn Kuehn could raise in a year, and how much he could earn in dollars and cents. It was not error to allow a witness to state how long it would take a team to cross the railway dump on the crossing from the beginning of the approach. 1 Greenl. Ev., 61. It was error to admit testimony that the approach was too narrow to .allow a wagon to turn around on it with safety. The facts only could be stated to the jury. It was in proof that the ascent was steep, that the way was narrow; its dimensions were given; and it was shown that there was a precipice on each side, or at least steep sides, and that to back down the steep there was danger of running over the sides. The question comes within the rule of the case of Shelley v. City of Austin, 74 Texas, 608. The jury should have been left to form their own conclusion from the facts. Cooper v. The State, 23 Texas, 336; Haynie v. Baylor, 18 Texas, 509. It is insisted that it was error to allow proof that defendant had a signboard about seventy-five yards northeast of the crossing, with a direction upon it, ‘1 Trains will not here exceed six miles an hour.’ ’ The petition alleged that there was such a signboard at the corporate limits; the proof showed that it was within the corporate limits, over a mile. It was not necessary to plead the fact at all; but having been pleaded, it is contended that it must be proved as alleged, and that there is a fatal variance in the averments and the proof. The gist of the allegation was, that by the regulations of the company trains were not allowed to run faster than six miles an hour at the place where Kuehn was hurt. The proof was responsive to this issue. It would be a very technical application of the rule to hold that there was an essential variance, and we do not think it should be so held. This difficulty can be easily obviated before another trial 1 Greenl. Ev., secs. 56, 64. In regard to the evidence of Hamilton, a life insurance agent, who testified that he was familiar with the Carlyle mortuary tables, and had worked under it, we may say, that while it is our opinion that an expert may give such testimony, it would have been more satisfactory if the-tables themselves had been offered. This same witness was permitted by the court, over objection of defendant, to state the cost of raising a child in Guadalupe County, and that it would cost $10 per month. Defendant reserved exceptions to the ruling upon several grounds, among which was that the testimony did not give a proper basis for damage; and error is now assigned upon the same ground. The two minor children of deceased recovered each $2000 by the verdict and judgment. The testimony was clearly inadmissible. The measure of damages for these children was not what it would cost to board or educate them, but the pecuniary benefit they could reasonably expect to receive from their father during the probable duration of his-life. To ascertain what they might reasonably expect to receive from him, proof of his age, circumstances, health, habits of industry, sobriety, economy, occupation, skill and capacity, and such like facts, would be admissible. He was under oblications to raise his children, and to see that they were supplied with necessaries during their minority, but the cost of doing so would not be the measure of their legal loss by his death in a suit therefor. It might be much less or much more. Railway v. Cowser, 57 Texas, 300; City of Galveston v. Barbour, 62 Texas, 174; March v. Walker, 48 Texas, 375; Cotton Press Co. v. Bradley, 52 Texas, 601; Winnt v. Railway, 74 Texas, 32; Railway v. Douglass, 69 Texas, 694; Railway v. Lester, 75 Texas, 60; 75 Texas, 224; 78 Texas, 541. We are not inclined to say that there was no evidence of gross negligence of defendant and its servants, and that the court should have so instructed the jury, as requested by the defendant. In discussing the question of the degree of care to be used by a deaf person who was struck while walking on a railway track, Chief Justice Stay ton says: “The fact that such was his condition made it the more necessary that he should not place himself in a place of danger.” Artusy v. Railway, 73 Texas, 191. This is correct reasoning, but we do not think it would be proper to single out the fact and so instruct the jury, especially where the court, as in this case, has fully and carefully instructed the jury as to contributory negligence. On the former appeal of this case, Justice Walker, in speaking of the court’s charge, said: “ Having given a clear exposition of the law applicable to the facts, it was the court’s duty to refuse charges asked upon the subject covered by the general charge upon the effect of isolated facts as negligence or not.” 70 Texas, 581. The jury should be left to decide for themselves the meaning and force of the facts, unless made negligence per se by statute. So we conclude there was no error in refusing the requested charge of defendant, that extra care was required of deceased in case his sight and hearing were defective. Defendant also asked the court to instruct the jury, that “ when Kuehn was about to drive his wagon and team across the railway track, it was his duty to look and listen for an approaching train before attempting to cross the track, and not to drive carelessly into a place of possible danger; and if he failed to do so, and such failure contributed proximately to the injury, then plaintiffs cannot recover.” This instruction again singles out a particular fact and argues it for the jury, and for that reason is objectionable. The court, in the general charge, told the jury, that “it was the duty of deceased to look out for the approach of the train, and to observe all reasonable precaution before attempting to cross the track.” And again, “A person about to cross the track of a railway upon a public highway is bound to exercise all reasonable care and caution to avoid injury in crossing.” Again, the court charged: “You are instructed as a matter of law, that it is not the exercise of ordinary care and prudence for a person to drive with a team directly onto a railway crossing without making an effort to ascertain whether a train is approaching, or whether it is safe to drive on the track with his team.” This last charge was too much in favor of defendant; it told the jury, in effect, that certain acts would amount to negligence on the part of deceased. There were other more general instructions upon the same subject. There was no error in refusing the special charge requested. In the general charge the court instructed the jury, that the deceased and the railway company had an equal right to cross the road at the point where the accident happened, and that the law imposes on both parties the duty of using reasonable and prudent precautions to avoid accident and danger; and while it was incumbent on the railway company in running its train on the occasion referred to, to give the required signals by ringing the bell and sounding the whistle at least eighty rods before reaching the crossing, it was the duty of deceased to look out for the approach 'of the train, and to observe all reasonable precaution before attempting to cross the track. This charge is objected to by appellant, because it declares that “ both ICuehn and the defendant had equal rights to the crossing.” This charge -does not so declare; but it might have been so understood. The company has precedence in the use of its road and crossing, but that precedence is regulated by law. The respective rights of the company and the public are well. understood, and are explained in so far as they are applicable to this case in other portions of the court’s charge. The company’s rights are recognized, and the jury by the charge are required to •observe them. So qualified, and qualified by the company’s precedent right to the use, there was no error in the charge. The supposed vice in the charge is, that it may have been construed to mean that deceased and defendant each had an equal right to cross at the same time. In another special requested charge, the court is asked to tell the jury, that if ICuehn knew the crossing was bad, he should have been much more careful before attempting to cross. It was not necessary to so instruct the jury. A general charge upon the care to be used by deceased was sufficient and correct. It was not error to instruct the jury to the effect, that if the signboard mentioned was near the crossing, ICuehn could presume that trains would not run faster than six miles an hour. But it would have been error to •charge, as requested by defendant, that all testimony as to the signboard .should be discarded from the consideration of the jury. We do not think it incumbent upon us to decide as to the effect of the testimony offered to establish contributory negligence of ICuehn. The witness Busch lived nearly one mile east of the crossing, near the railway track. He testified, that he had often timed the speed of the trains in coming from the bridge to his house, and it took one minute and forty seconds. The crossing where ICuehn was hurt was between the bridge and witness’ house. The evidence was admissible to show the customary rate of speed of trains along by the crossing, travelling in the same direction of the train in question. It was shown that Kuehn lived near the crossing and often passed over it. The customary rate of speed of the train at this place was pertinent, as it gave him the right to regulate his conduct by it. For the same reason, it was not error to allow proof that it was the habit of persons operating the trains not to ring the bell in passing this crossing. The evidence was admissible for the additional reason that it tended to prove that the bell was not rung on the occasion of the accident. There was a conflict in the testimony as to whether the bell was rung at the time or not; the testimony offered strengthened the probability that it was not rung. The fact was not a distinct collateral fact. In the case of Grand Trunk Railway v. Richardson, 91 United States, 454, the question was whether the company’s locomotive caused a fire. Testimony was admitted, over objections, “ that at various times during the summer before the fire occurred, defendant’s locomotives scattered fire when going past the mill and bridge, without showing that either of those which the plaintiffs claimed communicated the fire were among the number, and without showing that the locomotives were similar in their make, state of repair, or management to those claimed to have caused the fire complained of.” Justice Shaw, delivering the opinion, said: “ The question has often been considered by the courts in this country and in England, and such has, we think, been generally held admissible, as tending to prove the possibility and the consequent probability that some locomotive caused the fire, and as tending to show a negligent habit of the officers and agents of the railway company.” 1 Whart. Ev., secs. 41, 42, 43, 40. If special acts are admissible to show a habit of negligence, as decided in the foregoing case, the habit itself would undoubtedly be. There was no error in admitting the testimony. Other errors assigned need not be noticed, as the questions will not probably arise on another trial. Because of the errors committed on the trial, as before noted, the judgment of the lower court should be reversed and the cause remanded; and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 11, 1893.","The International & Great Northern Railway Company v. Frederike Kuehn et al. No. 53. 1. Negligence — Pleading — Crossing Railway Track. — It is not always negligence to cross a railway track at a regular crossing in front of a moving train. All the facts and necessities of the occasion, the knowledge or means of knowledge of the person charged with negligence, are to be considered in deciding the question of negligence. See testimony held sufficient to support the allegation of negligence on part of the employes in charge of the railway train in a collision. 2. Depositions—Exceptions.—Objections to answers in depositions because not responsive to the interrogatories can not be made except by motion filed before announcement for trial. 3. Res Gestee—Expressions of Pain.—Complaints of existing suffering and exclamations of present pain are admissible as res gestee. Such complaints, however, are not competent when made after suit for such injuries. 4. Obstructions to View.—That there were trees along the track obstructing the view of one approaching a public crossing, and who was injured in a collision at the crossing, is competent, whether alleged or not. 5. Opinion — Nonexpert. — A witness not shown to he an expert can not give his opinion in evidence that persons operating the.train “ could have stopped and not have hit the wagon had they driven slower.” 6. Measure of Damages. — In an action for damages by the widow and children of a man killed in a railway collision, it is competent to prove how much cotton and corn the deceased could raise in a year, and how much he could earn. 7. Opinion as to Ordinary Facts.— It was error to admit testimony that the approach to the railway crossing (where the train collided with a wagon, causing injury) was too narrow to allow a wagon to turn around on it in safety. The facts only could be stated to the jury, and the jury should be left to their own conclusions. 8. Mortuary Tables.—It seems that a witness testifying to the probable duration of the life from mortuary tables, should produce them, or they should be offered in evidence. 9. Measure of Damages for Death, of Parent.—The measure of damages which a minor child is entitled to recover against one negligently causing the death of his father, is “ what he could reasonably expect to have received from the father during the probable duration of his life.” It was error to admit testimony to the cost of raising a child in the county of the residence of the child. This was not a proper basis for damages. 10. Customary Speed—Neglect to Ring Bell.—The customary rate of speed of the trains at the place at which the collision causing the injury occurred, is competent, as was the habit not to ring the bell at such crossing. It appeared that the injured party was well acquainted with the crossing, and the testimony was in conflict whether the bell was rung on the occasion of the collision and injury. Appeal from Comal.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Sometime prior to 1843, Dr. G. W. Long died in this State, and administration was had upon his estate in Fort Bend County. At the time of his death, Dr. Long left surviving him his wife and six whole brothers and sisters and four half-brothers and sisters, but no children. He left a considerable estate, consisting of land and personal property, among which was his own headlight certificate for 1280 acres of land. One of his sisters of the whole blood was Mary Williams, wife of Duke Williams; one of his brothers of the whole blood was. Ed. M. Long; three of his brothers of the half-blood were N. T., W. H., and J. J. Macon. Prior to the partition herein referred to, the four last named conveyed all their interest to Duke Williams, husband of Long’s-sister Mary above named. On June 1, 1853, one of the parties interested in the estate of Long filed a petition in the Probate Court of Fort Bend County for a partition of said estate, making Duke Williams, with several of the heirs, parties thereto, but did not join Mary Williams, Ed. M. Long, and the three Macons above named therein. The nonresident hems who were made parties were duly cited by publication. On the 25th day of July, 1853, this original petition for partition was amended, making the heirs who had not been joined as above set forth parties to such proceeding, and dismissing as to Duke Williams. It appears from this amendment that these new parties were nonresidents of this State. At the July Term, 1853, a decree was entered ordering the partition of this estate, but it does not appear from the record that all the parties had been regularly cited to answer plain tiff’s petition other than by a general recital in the judgment. At the August Term, 1853, the commissioners appointed by the above judgment made their report, which was confirmed; and by the partition so made, the 1280 acres certificate above referred to was given to Mary Williams, Edward M. Long, and the three Macons above named, so that by the terms of the decree, in connection with the transfers to Duke Williams above recited, the whole of this certificate became vested in Duke Williams and his wife, Mary. The land in controversy was after-wards located under contract with Duke Williams by virtue of this certificate: In 1864 or 1865 Duke Williams died, leaving his wife, Mary Williams, and five sons and daughters surviving him. Appellees claim the interests of two of these children, and appellant the remainder; and the court below rendered judgment upon this basis in favor of appellees, from which this appeal is prosecuted. Appellant claims under deed made by Mary Williams, the surviving wife, to J. J. Williams and M. F. Kennedy, the last named being husband of one of the daughters. Appellant’s first assignment of error attacks the validity of the decree of partition above referred to, upon the ground that it affirmatively appears from the record that Mary Williams, Ed. M. Long, and the three Macons were nonresidents of this State, and had never been properly served with citation; but we are of opinion that inasmuch as this decree constitutes the common source of title of appellant and appellees, that its validity is not material in this case. Had appellant proposed to show that his interest would have been greater by disregarding this decree than by upholding it, he would not be precluded from so doing; but inasmuch as his interest, as well as appellees’, in the land in controversy would be reduced by going back of the decree, we think he should be held to the common source. Burns v. Goff, 79 Texas, 236. It would therefore seem that appellant’s and appellees’ interest is the same, whether the decree be held valid or whether it be only held as evidence of a common source of title; and if this was the only cause of complaint the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. Appellant, however, after the rendition of the judgment in the Cvurt below, made a motion for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, which was overruled, and this action of the court is assigned as error. By this newly discovered evidence it is proposed to prove, that in their lifetime Duke and Mary Williams entered into a verbal contract with their son J. J. Williams to give him this land, with other property, in consideration of his agreement to take care of them during the remainder of their lives; and that after the death of Duke Williams, Mary Williams, his surviving wife, made the deed to J. J. Williams and M. F. Kennedy above referred to in pursuance of this contract. It seems that Duke and Mary Williams during this time resided in the State of Tennessee, but the record does not show that the law of Tennessee in reference to community property is different from that in this State, and we must therefore presume it to be the same. Bradshaw v. Mayfield, 18 Texas, 21; Porcheler v. Bronson, 50 Texas, 555; Green v. Rugely, 23 Texas, 539; Abercrombie v. Stillman, 77 Texas, 592; Crosby v. Huston, 1 Texas, 203; James v. James, 81 Texas, 381; Brown on Jur., sec. 31. Appellees contend that this motion should have been overruled, because it would tend only to show a verbal contract to convey land, which would be void under our statute of frauds; but we are of opinion, treating the Tennessee law to be the same as our own, the survivor of the community would have the right to convey the community property in satisfaction of an obligation of this kind. Brewer v. Wall, 23 Texas, 585; Primm v. Barton, 18 Texas, 206; Long v. Walker, 47 Texas, 173; Garnett v. Jobe, 70 Texas, 696. Even if it be conceded that Duke and Mary Williams could not have been compelled to comply with their verbal contract to convey this land, it would seem that upon their refusal so to do, Duke Williams would be liable upon a quantum meruit for the value of the services rendered thereunder (Sprague v. Haines, 68 Texas, 216); and as this would be a community debt, the right of the survivor to convey community property in satisfaction thereof would seem to be clear. We are therefore of opinion that this alleged newly discovered evidence was material; and if negligence is not to be imputed to appellant for his failure to discover it in time for the trial, his motion for a new trial should have been granted to enable him to produce it. The fact that such evidence can be produced, is shown by an affidavit made by M. F. Kennedy and a letter from Thomas Duke Williams, a son of Mary and Duke Williams, Sr.; and appellant’s attorney makes affidavit, that he had been diligent in looking up evidence in the case; that he had written a number of letters to Kennedy and to Thomas D. Williams, but did not learn of the. facts stated in his motion as above set forth until after the trial, and from these affidavits it would seem that he had been reasonably diligent in the premises. In speaking of this question, Chief Justice Wheeler, in Mitchell v. Bass, 26 Texas, 377, says: “ Such motions are received with careful scrutiny, and are held to address themselves very much to the discretion of the court; and where the court has refused an application made upon this ground, the appellate court will not reverse, unless it shall appear that-the court below has not exercised its discretion according to the established rules of law. Yet, much as should be left to the discretion of the court, and reluctant as the appellate court may be to interfere with the exercise of that discretion, there are cases where the established rules of law and the principles of adjudged cases would be disregarded if a party was■ denied anew trial upon newly discovered evidence. The party who brings■ himself within the principles of such cases is entitled to a new trial as a matter of right, unless it be in those cases where it is apparent to the court. that the justice of the case has been attained. Where there can be any doubt of the justice of the verdict, to refuse a new trial, when the party has really discovered new evidence of a conclusive tendency, would be against justice and precedent; and by new evidence is meant proof of some new and material fact in the case, which has come to light since the trial.” And again: “ It is desirable that there should be an end of litigation with as little delay and expense as possible consistent with the great end of litigation—a correct decision of causes according to their real merits; but it should always be sought in subordination to the great end to be attained.” This language is quoted with approval in Wolf v. Mahan, 57 Texas, 175. See, also, Railway v. Forsyth, 49 Texas, 171, and Railway v. Barron, 78 Texas, 421. Taking the affidavits in this case to be true, we are of opinion that they show reasonable diligence on the part of appellant and his attorney; and presuming the law of Tennessee to be the same as in this State, we think the evidence material, and that a new trial should have been granted. Let the judgment of the court below be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance with this opinion. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 23, 1893.","N. C. Hilburn v. E. R.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This appeal is prosecuted by Sanger Bros, and the Martin Brown Company from a verdict and judgment rendered against them and K. V. Northington jointly, in the District Court of Taylor County, on the 10th day of March, 1888, in favor of H. M. Henderson, trustee, for the use and benefit of J. W. Carter and Fechheimer Bros. & Co., in the sum of $15,146.22, for the alleged conversion by them jointly of a stock of merchandise conveyed and delivered by Donovan & Wylie to said Henderson on the 26th day of July, 1884, in trust, to secure certain debts then about to become due to said Carter, Fechheimer Bros. & Co., and others, from said Donovan & Wylie. We find from the record that on said 26th day of July, 1884, said Donovan & Wylie, who were then engaged in mercantile business in the town of Abilene, Texas, being in a failing condition and desirous of securing certain preferred creditors, at the instance of said J. W. Carter, who was one of said creditors, and at the instance of a surety for said Donovan & Wyíie to said Fechheimer Bros. & Co., also a firm of said creditors, made, executed, and delivered to said Henderson, with the knowledge and assent of said Carter and of said surety, but without the knowledge or consent of said Fechheimer Bros, and Co., or any of the other beneficiaries, a certain instrument in writing, by which said Donovan & Wylie conveyed to said Henderson in trust their entire stock of goods then situated in Abilene, to secure and enforce the payment of the several debts then about to become due to the creditors therein named, including said J. W. Carter and Fechheimer Bros. & Co.; and authorized said trustee to sell said property if said debts, or any part thereof, should not be paid at maturity, and apply the proceeds of such sale to the payment of said several debts in full, if sufficient for that purpose, and if not, then ratably; balance, if any, to be paid back to said Donovan & Wylie. We find that contemporaneously with the execution of said instrument, termed a deed of trust, said Henderson was placed in the actual and exclusive possession of said entire stock of goods, and that thereafter said Northington, in the capacity of sheriff of Taylor County (which office he then held), on said 26th day of July, 1884, levied a writ of attachment, at the instance of the attorney for Sanger Bros., on a portion of said stock of goods, to-wit, a lot of clothing valued at $3211.60, which attachment was issued out of the County Court of Taylor County in favor of said Sanger Bros, against said Donovan & Wylie, to collect a debt of $838.17, which said Donovan & Wylie owed to said Sanger Bros.; that at the time of making this levy said sheriff demanded and obtained from said Henderson the keys to said store house and took actual possession of said entire stock of goods, and that the proof tended to show that said «attorney for Sanger Bros, was present at said store at the time; that said sheriff, continuing in the exclusive possession of said entire stock of goods, a few hours thereafter levied an attachment against said Donovan & Wylie in favor of Middleton & Daugherty on said entire stock of goods, subject to the prior levy for Sanger Bros.; and on the following day (July 27), while still in possession, levied an attachment writ upon said entire stock of goods, subject to prior levies, in favor of the Martin Brown Company against said Donovan & Wylie, which attachment issued out of the District Court of Taylor County, to collect a debt of $3574.27 which said Donovan & Wylie owed said Martin Brown Company; that the return on the first attachment levied stated that it was levied upon said clothing, attaching an inventory thereof, and the returns on the Other two attachments recited that they were made on the entire stock of goods, subject to the prior levy of Sanger Bros, on the same property; that the stock of goods remained in the hands of said sheriff till his successor in office acquired the possession thereof; that thereafter the attachment liens were foreclosed, Sanger Bros.’ attachment upon the clothing as described in the return on that writ, and the other attachments, to-wit, the Martin Brown Company attachment and subsequent attachments, on the entire stock of goods subject to the prior levy of Sanger Bros., the Middleton & Daugherty suit having been dismissed a few days after the attachment was levied: that under these judgments of foreclosure separate orders of sale were issued, but the entire stock of goods was advertised and sold by the proper officer of Taylor County under the order of sale issued in the Martin Brown Company suit, and the proceeds of such sale distributed among the different plaintiffs in said suits, Sanger Bros, being first paid; that appellants were paid by remittances tó their attorneys in Fort Worth. The record does not disclose at whose instance the sale and distribution of the proceeds were made, nor what knowledge, if any, Sanger Bros, and the Martin Brown Company had, in receiving their respective parts of the proceeds of said sale, of the manner in which the property had been sold and the proceeds distributed. We fail to find in the record any evidence of an agreement or understanding between Sanger Bros, and the Martin Brown Company that they would act together in having said foreclosure sale made and share together the benefits of the same. Appellee alleged the capacity in which he held said stock of goods at the date of the seizure as disclosed above, but failed to allege the acceptance of the provisions of said deed of trust on the part of any of the beneficiaries prior to said levies; and his petition was specially excepted to on this ground. He also alleged that appellants acted together in causing the seizure and conversion of the entire stock of goods, of the alleged value of $23,714.73, and, as measure of damages, set out the amount of his commissions and the debts due to said Carter and Fechheimer Bros. & Co., respectively, and prayed to recover in his own behalf and in the capacity of trustee as well as for the use and benefit of said Carter and Fechheimer Bros. & Co. His petition was specially excepted to for misjoinder of causes of action and nonjoinder of the beneficiaries in said deed of trust. The exceptions were all overruled and the points duly reserved ; but the court on the trial eliminated the issue of a recovery in his own behalf, and submitted his right to recover in the other capacity upon the theory that the recovery should be apportioned amongst the accepting beneficiaries in said deed of trust according to the amount of their respective debts, and that it should be limited to the amount of said debts, if less than the value of the goods converted. The court also charged the jury substantially as follows: If you find that ‘1 Sanger Bros, and the Martin Brown Company acted in concert and together, and so acting the Martin Brown Company sued out, or caused to be sued out, the order of sale under which the goods were sold, it being understood and agreed between them at the time that they would participate in and together share the benefits of such sale, and after the sale did in fact share the benefits thereof, and that thereby the value of said goods was wholly lost to said trustee and accepting beneficiaries,” they would all be liable; of which charge appellants complain on the ground that there was no evidence to warrant it. On a former trial of the cause appellee, upon discovering a variance between the description of his deed of trust ^contained in his petition and the instrument itself when offered in evidence, was permitted to withdraw his announcement of ready for trial and have the cause withdrawn from the jury after two witnesses to the execution of the deed of trust had testified, of which complaint is also made, based upon a plea in bar of this action. It is earnestly contended by appellants that appellee can not maintain this suit without also joining with him the several beneficiaries named in said trust deed, and we have been cited to a great many authorities upon this question. In our opinion they are entirely inapplicable, being mostly cases where beneficiaries in deeds of trust are held to be necessary or proper parties, according to the well established rules of equity. This is an action at law for the conversion of the goods, and the ancient maxim of the common law, that possession is title as against a wrongdoer, is more applicable. It is true that the instrument under which Henderson took possession of said goods did not vest in him the legal title, but only created a lien upon the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries therein named; but it is also true that his possession under said instrument was in the nature of a pledge, and entitled him to maintain an action against a trespasser, though the title was not in him. See Jones on Pledges, sec. 10, 12, 434. Osborn v. Koenigheim, 57 Texas, 91, and subsequent cases. It is well settled that an attaching creditor who causes property held in pledge to be seized and taken from the possession of the pledgee is a trespasser within the meaning of this rule'. In such case the measure of damages is the full value of the goods, without reference to the amount of the debts secured by the pledge. Jones on Pledges, secs. 433, 434; Treadwell v. Davis, 34 Cal., 601; Thompson v. Toland, 48 Cal., 100; Osborn v. Koenigheim, above, and subsequent cases. In this case the record discloses that at least one, if not two, of the beneficiaries assented to the mortgage and pledge prior to the levies. We do not think that the force of the acceptance by Carter’s agent and attorney was at all affected by the subsequent expressions of indignation and dissatisfaction on Carter’s part at not being better secured. It is not necessary, therefore, to decide whether or not the acceptance by the trustee alone, prior to the levies, was sufficient, and we do not decide that question, but call attention to the alleged defect in the petition in this respect as disclosed in the above conclusions of fact. If the trust deed and pledge are not vitiated by fraud, as alleged by appellants, we hold that appellee is entitled to maintain this suit under the facts disclosed in this record for the full value of the stock of goods, without reference to the amount of the debts secured. We are of opinion, however, that the court below erred in giving the charge quoted above, because we find no evidence in the record that appellants sued out or caused to be sued out the order of sale under which the goods were sold in pursuance of an understanding and agreement between them at the time that they would participate in and together share the benefits of such sale; and for this reason we feel constrained to reverse the judgment appealed from. It seems to us that if appellee relied on any such agreement and understanding to show a joint liability, he should have produced some evidence of it, the burden being on him to show the alleged concert of action. It must have been easily within his power to have proven by the officers who issued and executed said process the facts attending the issuance and execution thereof, at least to the extent of showing who caused it to be done, there being other parties interested besides appellants. It seems to us that the sale by Sheriff Cunningham of the entire stock of goods in bulk under the order issued upon the judgment in favor of the Martin Brown Company, and the distribution of the proceeds of said sale amongst the several attaching creditors, including Sanger Bros., in the absence of any proof as to why he pursued this course, should be deemed a mere irregularity on his part, and not proof tending to show an agreement or understanding between appellants. The action of the court below in permitting appellee, on a former trial, to withdraw his announcement of ready after his testimony in part had been introduced, and in discharging the- jury, is not deemed to have been an abuse of discretion. Very many other questions are raised by the assignments and propositions of appellants, all of which have been carefully considered, but as they may not arise upon another trial we decline to pass upon them. On the ground stated above the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered October 18, 1892.

Parties to Suit — Trustees and Beneficiaries. — A trustee to whom goods have been conveyed for the benefit of certain creditors, and who is in actual possession of them at the time they are taken under attachment by other creditors, may sue for the taking and conversion of the goods without joining with himself the beneficiary creditors under the trust deed. 2. Measure of Damages — Attaching Creditors. — The measure of damages which the trustee may in such case recover for the taking and sale of the goods under attachment is their full value, without reference to the amount of the debts secured by the deed of trust. 3. Charge of Court Without Evidence. —It is error in the court to charge the jury as to the joint liability in tort of two defendants, upon the theory that they acted in concert and under agreement in committing the tort, when there is no evidence to sustain such theory. See opinion for proof not tending to show concert of action between attaching creditors. 4. Practice — Withdrawal After Trial Entered Upon. — It is not an abuse of discretion for the court to permit plaintiff, after the trial is entered upon and part of his evidence given to the jury, to withdraw his announcement of ready, because of a variance between the description of a trust deed in his pleadings and the instrument itself as offered in proof.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This action was brought by appellant against appellee Zapp, as sheriff of Fayette County, and the other appellees as sureties on his official bond, to recover damages caused by alleged wrongful acts of Zapp’s deputy. The petition charged in substance that the deputy, in his official capacity, wrongfully and maliciously ejected plaintiff from her house, by virtue of some pretended writ, and carried her household goods out of the house, and dispossessed her of her home. The case was tried before a jury, and, after the introduction of evidence had concluded, the presiding judge instructed the jury that the plaintiff had not established the allegations in her petition, and directed them to find for defendant. In what particular the judge regarded the evidence as insufficient is not made to appear from the record. It is contended by appellees that the acts of the deputy sheriff, shown by the evidence, did not belong to that class for which his principal would be responsible, and we infer, from the briefs of both parties, that this view was taken by the trial court. We gather from the evidence that appellant owned the house referred to in the petition, and was living in it when the acts complained of took place. She had some months before sold the land on which it stood to another person, reserving the house and the right to remove it at any time within two years from the date of the deed. Appellees controverted the fact, asserted by her, that the house was her homestead, but it is sufficient to say upon this point, that the evidence was not such as to warrant the court in assuming, as matter of law, that she was not entitled to it as her homestead, free from forced sale for debt. That she could acquire a homestead right in such property is decided in Cullers & Henry v. James, 66 Texas, 494. Sometime in March, 1889, one W. T. Rhodes, a deputy of Zapp, claiming to act in his official capacity as such deputy, levied upon the house by virtue of some writ, which is referred to in the answer of appellees and in the evidence as an execution issued from a Justice Court. Its nature is not further shown. About the 4th of April, the deputy went to the house, where appellant then was, and commanded her to get out of it; and upon her refusal to do so, put her out, carried all of her goods from the house, nailed it up, and thus deprived her of its possession. The deputy, while thus acting, asserted that he was doing so by virtue of his authority as deputy sheriff, and that he had a good bond behind him. Between the time of the levy and the dispossession of appellant, and also after the latter transaction, Zapp was notified of his deputy’s acts, was told that the house was appellant’s homestead, and was appealed to to release the levy, and, afterward, to restore appellant to the possession of the property. At one time he said he knew nothing about it; that it was from the Flatonia department; that it originated from a Justice Court. At another time, when fully informed as to what his deputy had done, and appealed to to undo it, he replied, that he knew nothing of the proceedings as far as the writ was concerned; that he would not do it; that the other side intended to fight it, and would protect him. The deputy testified on the stand that he acted in his official capacity of deputy sheriff. Appellant offered to prove by him the nature and contents of the writ under which he acted, but this was excluded by the court, on objection being made by appellees. If the property was appellant’s homestead — and the evidence would at least warrant the conclusion that it was — it was not subject to levy; and in such case, the acts done by the deputy in dispossessing appellant were clearly wrongful. Had it been shown that these acts had been done by the sheriff himself, acting under color of his office, a prima facie case would have been made against him and his sureties, and the burden would have been cast upon him to justify them. In seeking to fix upon him liability for the acts of his deputy, the appellant was required only to show that the wrongful act complained of was one which the deputy might, under proper circumstances, do as an officer, and that it was in fact done under color or by virtue of his official station. Delivered December 1, 1892. Says the Supreme Court of Massachusetts: “If the act from which the injury resulted was an official act, the authorities are clear that the sheriff is answerable; if it was not an official, but a personal act, it is equally clear that he is not answerable. But an official act does not mean what a deputy might lawfully do in the execution of his office; if so, no action could ever lie against the sheriff for the misconduct of his deputy. It means, therefore, whatever is done under color or by virtue of his office.” Knowlton v. Bartlett, 1 Pick., 278; Murf. on Sheriffs, sec. 60. The deputy was the general agent of the sheriff (Murfree on Sheriffs, section 75), and it was his duty to determine, as a guide to conduct in the execution of the writ which he held, the scope of the authority which it conferred, and the nature of the action which it enjoined or authorized. His determination of those questions, and his acts done in pursuance of it, were the exercise of official authority conferred upon him by his principal, and the latter was responsible for them. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to produce the writ under which the deputy proceeded. That he acted by virtue of his office could be shown by parol evidence. Murf. on Sheriffs, sec. 943. We think the evidence, as we have stated it, showed that the deputy was acting officially, and was sufficient to entitle plaintiff to have the cause submitted to the jury. The court below did not err in excluding parol evidence of the contents of the writ, but it was legitimate for plaintiff to show by parol that the deputy was assuming to act under an execution. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","Mary Luck v. B. L. Zapp et al. No. 44. 1. Homestead. — Plaintiff owned the house from which she was ejected, and was living in it at the time, but had sold the ground upon which it stood, reserving the house and the right to remove it at any time within two years. This evidence did not warrant the court in concluding, as a matter of law, that plaintiff was not entitled to it as her homestead. That she could acquire homestead right in such property, has been decided. 2. Liability of Sheriff for Acts of His Deputy. — The deputy sheriff, acting in his official capacity, and by virtue of an execution from a Justice Court, ejected plaintiff from her house, removed her goods therefrom, and nailed it up. The sheriff was told that it was her homestead, and appealed to to release the levy, and refused. The act done by the deputy was wrongful, and the sheriff' and his sureties are liable therefor. 3. Same. — In seeking to fix upon the sheriff liability for the acts of his deputy, appellant was only required to show that the wrongful act complained of was one which the deputy might, under proper circumstances, do as an officer, and that in fact it was done under color of or by virtue of his official station. 4. Deputy the Agent of Sheriff. — The deputy was the general agent of the sheriff, and it was his duty to determine, as a guide to conduct in the execution of the writ which he held, the scope of the authority which it conferred, and the nature of the action which it enjoined or authorized.

When an officer, such as deputy sheriff, does an act under color of his office, claiming to act, and, so far as he is concerned, intending to act officially, it is immaterial whether he has a writ or legal process.

Dig., art. 12,219; 60 Texas, 445. 2.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Abbott & Keller were partners, engaged in business as merchants in the town of Mangum, Greer County, Texas. One W. N. Barker attached their entire stock of goods, and also their store house and lots upon which it was situated. The defendant Abbott reconvened, alleging that the attachment wras wrongfully issued, and that his partner Keller refused to join in his plea of reconvention, and asked that he be made a party thereto. It seems that Keller was made a party to the suit. The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of appellee for the benefit of the firm, for the full value of the stock of goods, house, and lot, as claimed by him. The court below instructed the jury, that the measure of damage appellee would be entitled to recover, in case they found for him, would be the reasonable market value of the property levied upon and seized under the writ of attachment, at the time and place of such seizure, with interest from the date of the levy; and also, at the request of appellee, the jury wrere instructed, that this measure of damage would be “such an amount as the goods and house and lots were reasonably worth on the market at the date they were attached, together with interest thereon at the rate of 8 per cent from the date of such levy.” The giving of this charge, we think, will necessitate a reversal of the judgment. That the value of real estate is not the measure of the damage for levying an attachment thereon seems to be conceded; but appellee attempts to sustain this charge upon the theory that the land referred to was in Greer County, and that the court judicially Imows that no one has title to land in that county, and that therefore the house was personal property; but we think this would be no answer, even if it be conceded that the court did have such judicial knowledge. It will be noted, that the jury were instructed to find the value of the house and lots—not the value of the house alone, disconnected from the lots; and the evidence upon which the finding of the jury was based included the value of the lots. Appellee Abbott testified, that “ the house bought of plaintiff was worth about $100 at Vernon, and after they rebuilt it at Mangum, it and the lots were worth about $600.” If it be conceded that the lots were not the property of appellee, it will certainly not be contended that his right to recover their value is better than if he owned them. Appellant contends that appellee should not be allowed to maintain Ms plea in reconvention, because it appears therefrom that Keller, one of the partners, refused to join therein; and also, because it is claimed the attachment was with the consent of such partner. As a general rule, it must be conceded that all of the partners should join to recover for the conversion of partnership property. Kirbs & Spies v. Provine, 78 Texas, 353; Tynburg & Co. v. Cohen, 67 Texas, 220; 2 Bates on Law of Part., sec. 1030; 1 Lind, on Part., 279. But one partner can not defeat the rights of his copartner by refusing to join in such suit. Where one of the partners refuses to join, the other can, in some cases, use his name, even against his consent (1 Bindley on Partnership, 271, and authorities cited in note); and in other cases the nonconsenting partner can be made a party defendant. 2 Bates on Part., sec. 1027. If the attachment was wrongfully sued out, and this was done by collusion between appellant and Keller, for the purpose of injuring Abbott, Keller should be made a defendant in the plea of reconvention, and Abbott restricted to his individual damage, unless he should affirmatively show a case which entitles him to recover the full value of the partnership property thus converted, such as that he had paid partnership debts, and this would be necessary to reimburse him, or some other equitable cause that would entitle him to the proceeds of all the property as against his partner. If the attachment was wrongfully sued out by appellant without any collusion on the part of Keller, upon the refusal of Keller to join in the plea of reconvention, Abbott should be* allowed to use his name to recover the full amount of damage sustained by the firm. If appellant contends, that notwithstanding the attachment may have been wrongfully sued out, yet he was caused to take this step for the collection of his debt by the acts of Abbott or Keller, whereby they or the firm are estopped from denying that the attachment was rightfully issued, he should plead such estoppel, and the questions thus raised should be submitted under appropriate instructions to the jury. Scarbrough v. Alcorn, 74 Texas, 358. If Keller gave his consent to this attachment, knowing or believing that the legal grounds therefor existed, and with no intention to unlawfully injure his partner, but desiring thus to prefer appellant over the other creditors of the firm, we think this would be a protection to him for levying upon the firm property. Schneider & Davis v. Sansom, 62 Texas, 201; Baines v. Ullmann, 71 Texas, 529; Goodbar, White & Co. v. Bank, 78 Texas, 461; Martin Brown Co. v. Perrill, 77 Texas, 199; Blum v. Schram, 58 Texas, 524. But if this consent was given by collusion between appellant and Keller, understanding that the grounds therefor did not exist, then we believe that such consent would be no protection to appellant against the damage caused to Abbott. Bateman Bros. v. Ramsey, 74 Texas, 589; Orr & Lindsey Shoe Co. v. Harris, 82 Texas, 273. If appellee still desires to recover the value of the house, it will be necessary for him by amendment to allege a state of facts which will show that it was no part of the land, and that the levy was made by taking actual possession, as in case of personal property. Cullers & Henry v. James, 66 Texas, 494. We think what we have said disposes of all the questions presented in appellant’s brief which are likely to arise upon another trial. Let the judgment of the court below be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded, Delivered January 24, 1893.","W. N. Barker v. Abbott & Keller. No. 81. 1. Attachment — Measure of Damages for Wrongful Levy on Realty.—An instruction that the measure of damages for the wrongful levy of an attachment upon certain property is such an amount as the property was reasonably worth on the market at the time it was attached, is erroneous, where part of such property is realty. The value of real estate is not the measure of damage for levying an attachment thereon. 2. Parties to Suit for Partnership Property.—As a general rule, all partners must join to recover for the conversion of partnership property; but one partner can not defeat the rights of his copartner by refusing to join in such suit, and where he so refuses the copartner can in some cases use his name even against his consent. 3. Attachment—Damages—Consent of one Partner.—See opinion for rules of law as to pleading and measure of damages applicable to various phases of a case where one partner may have consented to or instigated an attachment of the partnership property upon grounds that did not exist. 4. Same.—Where one partner gives his consent to an attachment, believing that the legal grounds therefor exist, and with no intention to unlawfully injure the other partner, but desiring thus to prefer the attaching creditor over other creditors of the firm, this would be a protection to such creditor for levying upon the firm property. But if the consent is by collusion, the attaching creditor understanding that the grounds for the attachment do not exist in fact, it will be no protection to him against the damage caused to the nonconsenting partner by the levy.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellee sued appellants as receivers of the International & Great Northern Railroad Company, to recover damages for a personal injury, which appellee alleges was inflicted upon him through the negligence of a brakeman in their employment. Verdict and judgment were rendered in the lower court against appellants for $2500, from which they bring this appeal. The facts, as we find them from the record, are, that appellee, while in the employment of one Burkitt, who had a contract with appellants to furnish them with wood for their road, and while engaged in loading-cars belonging to appellants with wood thus furnished by Burkitt, was requested by a brakeman in appellants’ service to assist in pushing two cars, then loaded, for the purpose of coupling them to the caboose, and was directed by such brakeman to get between two cars, which were coupled together, in order to move them more easily. He did so, and while he was pushing against the front car, while both cars were slowly moving, the brakeman mounted one of them, on which a brake was set, and, without notice or warning to appellant, unfixed the brake, whereby the cars were caused to move suddenly forward and caught appellant’s foot and ran over his leg and crushed it, necessitating amputation. Appellant, in thus pushing the car, was acting in furtherance of his master’s business, as well as that of appellants. He was between 17 and 18 years of age, had not been long engaged in that work, and it was reasonably safe for him to get between the cars and push as he did, if there had been proper care on the brakeman’s part; and we conclude that he was not guilty of negligence in acting as he did, but that, in unsetting the brake without notice or warning, the brakeman was guilty of negligence which caused the injury. Appellee was damaged to the amount found by the jury. The evidence adduced in the trial below would, perhaps, have warranted the jury in finding that appellee was not acting in Burkitt’s interest when he was hurt, but in view of their finding we adopt the conclusion that he was.. The court charged the jury, in substance, that appellee was in Burkitt’s employment, and that it was not his duty to push the cars or assist in so doing unless such aid was reasonably necessary in expediting Burkitt’s business and in furtherance thereof; and that, if he pushed the cars only in response to the brakeman’s request, and as an accommodation to him, and not because it was necessary to the furtherance of Burkitt’s business, as an act reasonably incident to appellee’s'duties, then he would be a volunteer, and could not recover. But that if the brakeman requested or directed Bryant to assist in removing the cars in order to make up the train, and if Bryant did so as an act reasonably necessary in loading the train and moving the wood for Burkitt, and in furtherance of Burkitt’s business by facilitating the loading of the cars and making up the train, appellee could recover, if he was hurt through the negligence of the brakeman. Another portion of the charge, which is assigned as error, is as follows: “ You will determine from the evidence for what purpose Bryant went to push the cars, and whether Bryant’s act in pushing the cars down to the caboose was or was not reasonably necessary under the terms of his employment, and considering the nature of his duties in the furtherance and expediting Burkitt’s business, or whether he acted as a volunteer and as an accommodation to the brakeman, and not under the belief that to push the ears was a part of his duties, and not for the purpose of expediting Burkitt’s business. Under the facts stated appellee can not be treated as a fellow servant of the brakeman, and therefore precluded from recovering. Eason v. Railway, 65 Texas, 577; Bonner & Eddy v. Bryant, 79 Texas, 540. And as he was not himself guilty of negligence which contributed to his hurt, and as the brakeman’s negligence caused his injuries, the appellants are liable. Delivered November 24, 1892. The portion of the charge complained of improperly alluded to appellee’s belief as to whether or not it was a part of his duty to push the cars, for his right to recover would depend upon the facts to be found by the jury, and not upon his belief. The charge, however, does not instruct the jury that his belief on the subject would constitute the basis of appellants’ liability, and the jury would not have been warranted in so understanding it, in view of the previous and repeated specific directions, that his act must have been reasonably necessary in furthering or expediting his master’s interests. It would not be a fair construction of the charge to hold that it authorized a recovery upon appellee’s belief. Rather should it be interpreted to mean, if any effect whatever is to be given to such belief, that it must have existed in addition to the other facts defined as essentials to a verdict in appellee’s favor. The charge fairly submitted the issues to the jury, and the evidence is sufficient to support it, and the judgment is therefore affirmed. Affirmed.","T. R. Bonner et al., Receivers, v. A. B. Bryant. No. 36. 1. Fellow Servant. — 'Appellee was in the employ of one Burkitt, who had a contract with appellants to furnish them wood. While engaged in loading appellants' cars with wood, appellee was requested by a brakeman to assist him in pushing two loaded cars to the caboose, and was directed by the brakeman to get between the two cars, which were coupled together, in order to move them easily. He did so, and while pushing the cars, which were slowly moving, the hrakeman mounted one of them, upon which was a set brake, and, without warning or notice to appellee, unfixed the brake, whereby the cars were caused to move suddenly forward, and caught appellee’s foot and crushed his leg. Under the facts, appellee was not a fellow servant of the brakeman and thereby precluded from recovery. 2. Volunteer — Proper Charge. — The trial court in substance charged that plaintiff was in Burkitt's employment, and that it was not his duty to push the car, or to assist in doing so. unless such aid was reasonably necessary in expediting Burkitt's business and in furtherance thereof; and that if he pushed the car only in response to the brakeman's request, and as an accommodation to him, and not because it was necessary to the furtherance of Burkitt's business as an act reasonably incident to appellee’s duties, then he would be a volunteer, and could not recover. But if the brakeman requested or directed Bryant to assist in removing the cars, in order to make up the train, and if Bryant did so as an act reasonably necessary in loading the train, and moving the wood for Burkitt, appellee could recover, if he was hurt through the negligence of the brakeman. This charge fairly submitted the issue to the jury. 3. Charge — Plaintiff’s Belief. — “You must determine from the evidence for what purpose Bryant went to push the cars, and whether his act in pushing the cars down to the caboose was or was not reasonably necessary under the terms of his employment, and considering the nature of his duties in the furtherance of and expediting Burkitt’s business, or whether he acted as a volunteer and as an accommodation to the brakeman, under the belief that to push the cars was a part of his duties, and not for the purpose of expediting Burkitt's business.” The charge improperly alluded to appellee's belief, for his right to recover could not depend upon his belief,but upon the facts found by the jury; but the charge given, fairly construed, did not authorize a recovery on the basis of appellee’s belief, and judgment is affirmed.

"KEY, Associate Justice. This is an action of trespass to try title, brought by appellees J. R. Nasworthy and the San Angelo National Bank, against appellant, R. A. Flannagan, to recover section 182 of the public free school lands, located by virtue of Washington County Railroad scrip. Appellees claim the land by virtue of a sale made to said Nasworthy in January, 1884, at Austin, Texas, by the Land Board; appellee the San Angelo National Bank claiming a one-half undivided interest by mesne conveyance from said Nasworthy. Appellant pleaded not guilty, and in reconvention for damages for the wrongful and malicious suing out of a writ of sequestration. There was judgment for appellees for the land, and that appellant was not entitled to recover damages. It is contended that there was error in admitting in evidence the appointment in writing of J. T. Talbot as substitute trustee to sell an undivided interest in the land in controversy to pay a debt due the San Angelo National Bank, said appointment purporting to be for and in behalf of said bank, by M. B. Pulliam, as president, it not being made to appear by evidence that Pulliam, as president, was authorized to make such appointment either by the board of directors or the rules, regulations, or charter of the bank, nor that the board of directors had ever ratified said appointment. It appears that one Upton once owned an undivided half-interest in the land, and executed a deed of trust thereon to secure a debt to the San Angelo National Bank, in which William E. Ellis was named as trustee. This deed of trust provided that in the event of the failure of Ellis to act as trustee the bank might appoint a substitute. Ellis died, and M. B. Pulliam, signing his name as president, appointed J. T. Talbot as substitute trustee, who sold the land under the deed of trust, and at the sale the bank became the purchaser. We deem it unnecessary to determine whether or not the appointment of Talbot as substitute trustee was the action of the bank or of Pulliam only; because if the bank, as purchaser at the sale made by Talbot, acquired no title, then appellee Nasworthy is a tenant in common with-Upton, and, as against appellant, is entitled to recover if he has acquired title to the land through his purchase from the State. Appellant contends that appellees’ title to the land in controversy is fatally defective: 1. Because there was no classification of the school lands in Tom Green County, as required by the Act of April 12, 1883. 2. Because the land was not sold in the county where it was situated, as required by said act. 3. Because Nasworthy did not correctly describe the land in his application to purchase, as required by the rules and regulations of the Land Board. It was shown that the school lands of Tom Green County were not classified under the Act of April 12, 1883; but the order of the Commissioners Court of said county approving the appraisement of these lands by the county surveyor, under the law of 1881, if adopted by the Land Board as a basis for its action, was perhaps a sufficient compliance with the third section of the Act of April 12, 1883, in reference to the classification of school lands. But the sale of the land in question by the Land Board at Austin, Texas, instead of in the county where the land was situated, was in violation of the sixth section of said act; and for this reason, in the absence of curative legislation, the sale of the land to Nasworthy by the Land Board was void and conferred no title. Martin v. McCarty, 74 Texas, 128; The State v. Opperman, 74 Texas, 136. The case of Martin v. McCarty was decided in December, 1888, and the Twenty-first Legislature, which met in January following, passed an act validating certain acts of the Land Board. This last act was approved March 12, 1889 (page 106, Laws of 1889), and in so far as it applies to this case, reads as follows: “ Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That all contracts made by the Land Board of the State of Texas for the sale of the free school, university, and asylum lands >under the Act of April 12, 1883, to any person who has in good faith made such purchase, and in good faith has complied with the requirements of said act, the rules and regulations of the State Land Board, and the terms and conditions of his said contract, shall be and are hereby made valid and binding upon the State in the same manner as if the said Land Board had in all particulars complied with the requirements of the said law.” The appellees contend, that whatever irregularities or omissions there may have been in the proceedings of the Land Board in the sale of the land involved, the same are cured and the sale of the land validated by this act. We concur in this construction to the extent of holding, that if the healing act referred to is not unconstitutional, the purchase of the land in controversy by Nasworthy was validated, if he in good faith complied with the Act of April 12, 1883, the terms of his contract, and the rules and regulations of the Land Board. We doubt not that the decision in the case of Martin v. McCarty, already referred to, affecting as it probably did many purchases that had been made from the Land Board, was the reason impelling the Legislature to pass the act in question. It is contended, however, by appellant, that the validating Act of March 12, 1889, is forbidden by section 4, article 7, of our State Constitution, which declares that the Legislature shall have no power to grant any relief to purchasers of lands set apart to the public free school fund. Our Supreme Court has construed this provision of the Constitution in the case of Barker v. Torrey, 69 Texas, 7, in which an act of the Legislature, as much in the nature of 1 ‘ relief ’ ’ as the one now under consideration, was involved. In that case the Act of February 16, 1885, extending the time of forfeiture of the land for nonpayment of interest from March to August, was held to be valid, and not in contravention of the Constitution; and in the opinion it is said: “Notwithstanding that statute, the obligation of the purchaser to pay both principal and interest in strict accordance with his contract and the law under which it was made, continued; and the State, like any other creditor, could enforce all rights and claims which would ordinarily legally grow out of the fact that the interest was not paid on the very day it became due and payable. The statute did not release the purchaser from any obligation arising from the contract or its breach. The effect of the statute was, while leaving the purchaser fully bound, to suspend the right which the State had to cancel the contract and thus to forfeit the right of the purchaser to have the executory contract carried out if the annual interest was not paid on or before the first day of March.” The Legislature being clothed with the power to create the Land Board, and to authorize it to make rules and regulations for the sale of the school lands, thereby making the board the agent of the State to sell the lands, it also had the power to ratify the acts of its agent done contrary to or in excess of the authority conferred.' The board in making the sale of the land was accomplishing the very purpose for which it was created; and the Legislature having created the agent, and being satisfied with its acts and the results accomplished, had the power to sanction and approve such acts and legalize the contract entered into between the purchaser and the State through such agent; though the agent had, in the manner of making the contract, departed from certain mandatory provisions of the law creating the agency. And such approval and ratification, when it does not relieve the purchaser from any of the obligations resting upon him, is not so clearly “relief,” as this term is used in the Constitution, as would authorize us to hold that the act in question is forbidden by the constitutional provision above referred to. The third objection to appellees’ title involves the main question in the case. Recognizing that the law cast upon them the burden of showing the facts which would bring Nasworthy’s purchase within the class of contracts referred to and validated by the healing act above quoted, appellees put in evidence the following rules of the Land Board, of date October 23, 1883: “ Resolved by the board, that all common school, university, and asylum lands in all the counties of the State are hereby placed upon the market for sale or lease. “ Resolved, that under authority of section 7 of chapter 88, General Laws of 1883, the following is prescribed as the mode of placing said lands on the market: The application for purchase * * * of any of said lands shall be in writing and addressed to the secretary of the Land Board at Austin, Texas; said application shall fully and minutely describe each and every section desired to be bought, * * * giving number of section, block, and certificate, and name of original grantee, with character of soil, grass, timber, and water, if any, on each section; * * * the price per acre offered for the purchase. * * *' The application must be sworn to before some officer authorized to administer oaths, and the * * * sale will be regarded as vacated and null for misrepresentation or false description. * * * The application will be forwarded by the applicant to the Land Board at Austin. * * * And the same will be considered by the board on the first Tuesday of the following month.” The appellees also introduced the application of J. R. Nasworthy to purchase the land in controversy, as follows: “San Angelo, Texas, December 23, 1883. “ To the Secretary of the Land Board, Austin, Texas: “ Under and by virtue of the provisions of an act to provide for the classification, sale, * * * of the common school lands, approved April 12,1883, and the resolutions of the honorable Land Board, adopted October 23, 1883, * * * I hereby apply for the purpose of purchasing the following lands surveyed and set apart for the public school fund (which said land is represented on accompanying sketch), situated in Tom Green County, Texas: “ Respectfully, “J. R. Naswobthy.” Which application was properly sworn to, filed with the county surveyor of Tom Green, and forwarded to the secretary of the Land Board at Austin, and there filed as by law required; and it was admitted by the appellant that section 182, the same being the land in controversy, was by the State Land Board, at its first meeting in January, 1884, awarded to J. R. Nasworthy, and that all payments of principal and interest thereon required by law had been paid to date; and that Nasworthy properly executed his note for payment of the residue of the purchase money. Appellant objected to the introduction of all this testimony, and also to the evidence of Tarver, the county surveyor of Tom Green County, tending to show that the Commissioner of the Land Office, prior to Nasworthy’s application to purchase, had authorized him to sell the school lands in that county, under the Act of 1881; appellant contending, among other things, that, without a classification in conformity with the last named act, the Land Board had no authority to sell the land; and as to the application to purchase, that it did not conform to the rules and regulations of said board, in that it did not correctly describe the land sought to be purchased. We think this testimony, as well as the evidence introduced by appellees showing that in 1883 and 1884 the land in suit was used for pasturage, which was objected to by appellant, was admissible. To exclude the application to purchase and the award of the Land Board showing Nasworthy’s purchase, because there was no sufficient classification of the land, even if such was the fact, or because the sale was not made at the place required by the Act of April 12, 1883, would be to deny to appellees the right to show that Nasworthy’s purchase is such as was intended to be validated by the Act of March 12, 1889. Whether or not the description of the land given in the application to purchase was in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Land Board, was a question of fact to be determined by the jury, and not one of law to be decided by the court. The purpose for which the land was used was admissible, to aid the jury in determining the character of the land — whether agricultural or pasture — and the good or bad faith of Nasworthy in describing it as “ fit for pasture only.” Appellant’s theory, as gathered from his brief, appears to be, that in order for a purchaser of school or other lands to be protected under the Act of March 12, 1889, he must show, among other things, a strict compliance with all the rules and regulations of the Land Board; and it is contended that the purchase in this case falls short of such compliance, in this, that Nasworthy’s application does not give the number of the block of which the survey in question is a part, and that the description of the soil is not restricted to the survey in controversy, but applies equally to two other surveys, sought to be purchased at the same time. It is also contended that the testimony shows that the description of the land as suitable only for pasture was untrue, the contention being that at the time the application to purchase was made it was agricultural land. Without expressing any opinion upon the weight of testimony, we believe that the court below correctly interpreted the statute in question when it instructed the jury that if Nasworthy had reasonable ground to believe, and did believe, that the description of the land contained in his application to purchase was true, then he acted in good faith. If prior to the Act of March 12, 1889, in litigation between the State and Nasworthy, a question of fraud in the description given in his application to purchase had arisen, and it had been shown that, after exercising Ordinary care and diligence to ascertain the facts, Nasworthy had described the land in some respects inaccurately, but as he honestly believed was proper and correct, we believe that his title would have been upheld. In our opinion, the healing act in question was intended to apply to and protect such cases as the one just stated, as well as those where the purchaser had strictly complied with all requirements. If to obtain the benefits of that act the purchaser must show a strict compliance on his part with the law of 1883, the rules and regulations of the Land Board, and his contract, then, what did the Legislature mean by the words “in good faith,” used twice in the same line of the healing Act of 1889 ? If he had rigidly complied with the law, the rules and regulations of the Land Board, and his contract of purchase, how could his acts be otherwise than in good faith ? If one party to a contract does all that both the spirit and letter of the law, the obligations of his contract, and the rules prescribed by the other party thereto require of him, he certainly is not chargeable with bad faith. The words “ good faith,” as used in this law, can and should be given a meaning. They signify that the State will shield and protect the honest purchaser of its territory, though he may have made a mistake in the description given thereof; but that he who has attempted to defraud the State through a willful misdescription shall not become a beneficiary of the law in question. When a strict compliance with all requirements is shown, good faith is presumed; but when the rules of the Land Board are not rigidly complied with, the question of good or bad faith becomes one of intent. To impose upon the purchaser of land from the State the burden of showing absolute accuracy of description of the land applied for, especially as regards the purposes for which it may be utilized, would introduce into his title an element of uncertainty, as well as possible injustice, which we do not believe was intended by the Legislature or the Land Board. In fact, neither the statute nor the rules of the Land Board require the purchaser to state in his application to purchase the purposes for which the land is suitable; but as Nasworthy described the land as suitable for pasture only, and the rules of the board declared that misrepresentation or false description should result in a forfeiture of the land, the uses for which the land was suitable became an issue in the case. But the same rules of law apply to this description that do to those that were required, and if Nasworthy was honestly mistaken his purchase is protected. The history of our State, past and current, shows that its possibilities are such that the honest, purchaser of its soil ought not to be expected to penetrate the future, and with absolute certainty foretell the capabilities of the land he desires to purchase. The time has been, within the memory of, many persons now living, when large portions of the territory of Texas now devoted to successful farming were considered, by almost everybody, as suitable for grazing purposes only. Appellant complains of the action of the court in excluding testimony offered to show the depth of soil and productiveness of lands adjoining the section in controversy. As to the proposed testimony in regard to the depth of soil on an adjoining survey, as disclosed by digging a shaft, the bill of exceptions does not state how near the shaft was to the land involved; and we, perhaps, would not reverse the case because of the exclusion of this testimony. But as to the other testimony offered and excluded, the bill of exceptions shows that the witness would have testified, “that he had owned and cultivated five acres of ground for several years, adjoining the land in controversy on the south; that the soil on said five acres was like the thinnest and poorest on the land in controversy, and that said five acres produced well the agricultural products of this country, without irrigation.” Next to the cultivation of the land in controversy, it occurs to us that the cultivation of similar land in the same vicinity would be one of the most satisfactory methods of determining the productive qualities of the land involved. When such questions as value or fitness for a particular use are involved, it is often permissible to use evidence which will enable the jury to draw conclusions by comparisons. 7 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 60. The excluded testimony, if true, would have afforded a test exceedingly fair to appellees. The small tract cultivated was separated from this land only by an imaginary line, and its soil was similar to the “ thinnest and poorest ’ ’ on said land. This testimony tended to show that the soil on the land in suit was productive; a fact which appellees sought, by showing the character and depth of soil, to negative. Of course, if this fact had been shown, it would not have conclusively proved that the land involved was agricultural land when Nasworthy made his application to purchase, because it requires sufficient and timely rains, as well as productive soil, to make agrieutural land. But the excluded testimony tended to show that the land was suitable for agricultural purposes. It is true, as appellees contend, that if it had been shown that this land was agricultural land in 1883 and 1884, still it would not necessarily follow that Nasworthy had not acted in good faith in describing it as suitable for pasture only. He may have honestly thought so and been mistaken. But the excluded testimony was admissible, because its tendency was to prove a material fact, proper to have been considered by the jury in determining the main fact. The excluded evidence offered to prove that the year 1883 was a seasonable year was also admissible; but as that fact was proved by other witnesses, and not controverted, the error is harmless. The charge of the court, as well as its refusal to give certain special charges asked by appellant, is complained of. The assignment of errólas to the charges refused is too general; but as the case will be reversed, we have examined these charges and the charge given. There is one omission in the court’s charge, and one statement in it ought to have been omitted. On all questions involving appellees’ title to the land the burden rested upon them; the charge given was silent on this subject, and the special charges asked by appellant were sufficient to direct the attention of the court to the omission. After correctly telling the jury what the issue for their determination on the question of title was, and submitting that issue to them, the court charged as follows: “And in this connection, you are instructed that the question is not - whether the land in question is agricultural or pasture land, or was at-the time Nasworthy made his application to purchase same,’ ’ etc. While it is true that this was not the controlling issue in the case, yet it was a subordinate question, pertinent to the main issue. If the land was shown to be agricultural land, especially if it was such at the time Nasworthy made his application to purchase, it was important testimony in behalf of appellant. If it was not agricultural land, that fact was very important to appellees. It is ordinarily sufficient for the charge of the court to inform the jury what the issues for their determination are, without attempting to explain what are not issues. Such attempts are often calculated to impress the jury with the belief that the court entertains certain views as to the weight of important testimony. Such was the tendency of the charge in question, and it should not have been given. We have examined the case of Nobles v. Cattle Company, 69 Texas, 434, cited by appellees, holding that, as against a purchaser of school land under the Act of April 12, 1883, no one but the State can raise the question of fraud. That case was tried and decided on appeal before the decision in Martin v. McCarty, and the purchaser was not attempting to avail himself of the benefit of a healing statute. If he had been guilty of fraud in obtaining the land from the State, that fact, as held in that case, only rendered his title voidable. Delivered November 16, 1892. But in the case at bar, it being necessary for appellees to avail themselves of the healing Act of March 12, 1889, the law casts upon them the burden of showing that Nasworthy had acted in good faith in all he did in reference to the contract of purchase under which appellees claim. For this reason this case is distinguishable from the one just cited. Because admissible testimony was excluded, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Chief Justice Fisher did not sit in this case.","R. A. Flannagan v. J. R. Nasworthy et al. No. 270. 1. Immaterial Error — Trespass to Try Title by Tenants in Common. — Action in trespass to try title by two tenants in common. Title of one was clear, that of the other disputed; defendant exhibited no title. Meld, on appeal by defendant from a judgment for the land in favor of both the plaintiffs, that inasmuch as one tenant in common could recover against a trespasser, it was immaterial whether both plaintiffs showed title or but one. 2. Classification of Public School Lands. — The order of the Commissioners Court of Tom Green County approving the appraisement of the public school lands by the county surveyor under the law of 1881, if adopted by the Land Board as a basis for its action, was perhaps a sufficient compliance with the third section of the Act of April 12,1883. 3. Validating Act of March 12, 1889. — The validating Act of March 12, 1889, is not unconstitutional, or forbidden by section 4, article 7, of the State Constitution, in granting relief to purchasers of public school lands. 4. Case Adhered to. — Barker v. Torrey, 69 Texas, 7, adhered to. 5. Evidence Competent — Irregular Purchase of Public School Land. — To exclude the application to purchase and the award of the Land Board because there was no sufficient classification of the land (if such was the fact), or because the sale was not made at the place required by law, would be to deny to the holder of such land the right to show that the purchase, though irregular, was validated by said Act of March 12, 1889. 6. Same. — Whether a description of the land given in the application to purchase was in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Land Board, is a question of fact, and not of law to be decided by the court upon the admissibility of evidence. 7. Purchaser of School Land in Good Faith. — The trial court correctly interpreted the statute in question in instructing the jury that if the purchaser had reasonable ground to believe and did believe that the description of the land contained in his application to purchase was true, then he acted in good faith. 8. Good Faith as Used in the Validating Act. — The words good faith, as used in said law, signify that the State will shield and protect the honest purchaser of its lands, though he may have made a mistake in the description given thereof. 9. Agricultural Lands — Pasture Lands. — Upon charge of fraud in a purchase of public school lands, represented to be pasture lands instead of agricultural, evidence of the quality of soil adjoining, and cultivated, is competent; also 'the kind of seasons prior to and at the time of the application to purchase. 10. Charge. — It is ordinarily sufficient for the charge of the court to inform the jury what the issues for their determination are, without attempting to explain what are not issues. Such attempts may impress upon the jury the belief that the court entertains certain views as to the weight of evidence, and so be upon the weight of testimony. See example. 11. Burden of Proof. — The burden of proof lies upon the purchaser to show the facts placing his claim under the relief law, and to show that the purchaser acted in good faith in his transactions constituting his purchase. Appeal from Tom Green. Tried below before Hon. J. W. Timmins. Scott, Jenkins & McCartney, for appellant. 1. The pretended sale by the Land Board being illegal, and purchaser not having complied with the terms of the law, the Legislature had no power to relieve him. The sale was contrary to law, in that there was no classification, no appraisement, and no sale in the county where the land was situated. The State v. Opperman, 74 Texas, 136; Martin v. McCarty, 74 Texas, 128; Const. 1876, art. 7, sec. 4; Const. 1866, art. 10, sec. 4. 2. The admission of immaterial evidence over defendant’s objection, calculated to mislead the jury, is reversible error. The rules of the Land Board required the applicant to describe the land sought to be purchased, and that the sale should be void for misrepresentation or false description. Nasworthy, in his application made December 23, 1883, described the land as “fit only for pasture.” Act April 12, 1883; Rules Land Board, Oct. 23, 1883; Act March 12, 1889, Gen. Laws, 106. 3. The court erred in refusing to allow the defendant to prove the depth of soil on land adjoining said section and what had been raised on land adjoining the same. The evidence was admissible as a circumstance to prove the character of the soil on the survey in controversy and its adaptability to agriculture. 4. He who claims under a healing act must bring himself strictly within the provisions thereof. Cochran & Hill, for appellees. 1. The lands were properly classified under the Act of 1881, and such classification was sufficient until changed by the Land Board under the Act of 1883. The Act of 1883 permitted the Land Board to make rules with reference to the classification of school lands, and to provide for placing same on the market. The Land Board, by its rule of October 23, 1883, prescribed rules for the classification of land, and for sale of the same, and for placing the lands on the market. Laws 1881, 119, 120; Laws 1883, secs. 3, 6, 7, pp. 85-87; The State v. Opperman, 74 Texas, 136; Neville v. The State, 11 S.W. Rep., 868. 2. Appellee Nasworthy in good faith made his purchase of the land, and in good faith complied with the rules and regulations of the State Land Board. For this reason the alleged defects in his title are cured, and he is entitled to the benefit of the healing Act of March 12, 1889. Laws 1883, 83-89; Act March 12, 1889. 3. The healing Act of 1889 ratified purchases made in good faith under the rules and regulations of the Land Board. • The Legislature ratified this sale, and such ratification was legal and was not prohibited by the Constitution. Const. 1876, art. 7, sec. 4; Laws 1889, 106; Barker v. Torrey, 69 Texas, 7; Blum v. Looney, 69 Texas, 3. 4. The law does not define what constitutes good faith. Good faith is a question of fact for the jury. Any instruction upon what is good faith would have been a charge on the weight of evidence, If appellee desired further instruction upon good faith, he should have asked it. Failure of court to more fully present the question is not reversible error if no charge is asked. The jury understood what was meant by good faith, and the charge fully presented the issue of good faith."
"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This appeal is from a judgment rendered by the District Court of Stephens County, in favor of appellee, who sought to recover of appellants about 10 acres of land near Crystal Falls, in said Stephens County. The case was tried without a jury, and is brought here upon a statement of facts without any conclusions of law and fact. Appellee claimed under a patent issued under the pre-emption law of 1873; and appellants claimed under a patent issued prior thereto by virtue of a certificate issued to the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway Company. The determination of the matter in controversy depends upon the true location of the eastern and southern boundaries of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway Company survey. When this survey was made there was a vacant body of land, consisting of about 500 acres, surrounded by the E. L. Walker, Sarah Blythe, J. J. Metcalfe, the Peters Colony surveys 1161, 1170, 1158, 1154, and the Clear Fork of the Brazos River. The location of appellants for about 450 acres was made upon this vacant body of land. They insist that the intention of the State was to grant, by virtue of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway Company’s location, all the land included between these older surveys and the river. If it had been proven on the trial that no actual survey had been made for them, it would seem that their contention should be sustained. In the absence of such proof, however, it must be held that an actual survey was made. Gerald v. Freeman, 68 Texas, 201. Their survey calls to begin at the southwest corner of the E. L. Walker survey, which is a well established corner, and then calls for the southeast and southwest corners of the Peters Colony survey 1161, which are also well established, and thence south to a marked corner on the north line of the Metcalfe; thence east 82 varas to the northeast corner of the Metcalfe, which is an open corner; thence south 712 varas; thence east 1438 varas, calling for the northeast corner of survey 1158; thence north 1344 varas to the bank of the river; thence up the river north 50§ west 482 varas, to a marked corner; thence west 475 varas to the beginning. It is contended that the call for the northeast corner of 1158 should control, (1) the call for “south 712 varas” from the northeast corner of the Metcalfe, extending it to 986-¡- varas; (2) the call of 1438 varas east, extending it to 1555 varas; (3) the call for north 50f- west 480 varas, changing its distance to 577 varas. It would seem also that this contention should be sustained, if said northeast corner of 1158, or the lines leading to it, could be found marked upon the ground. It is laid down in this State that the rule, that a call for a marked line or corner of an older survey will prevail over a call for course and distance, is not applicable to an unmarked line or corner which can only be found by running course and distance from some other marked line or corner or well known object. The reason of the rule is, that in each instance the boundary is ascertained by calls for course and distance, and hence effect should be given, where such calls are conflicting, to the one which is most in harmony with the other calls of the grant. Gerald v. Freeman, 68 Texas, 201; Duff v. Moore, 68 Texas, 270; Davidson v. Killen, 68 Texas, 406. The lines and corners of 1158 are all open lines and corners, except the southeast corner, which is well established. The lines and corners of 1154 are likewise open, except its southwest corner, which is the southeast corner of 1158. If the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway Company’s survey has its southern and eastern boundaries established by the several calls for course and distance, and the call for ■the northeast corner of 1158 be rejected as a mistake, there is complete harmony in all the calls, and the requisite quantity of land is secured. ■Constructing the survey by this method, the calls for 1344 varas north to the corner in the bank of the river, and thence north 5Of west 482 varas to a well established corner, are found to be strictly accurate. Assuming that the surveyor went on the- ground and made an actual survey, it is not an unreasonable conclusion, under the facts disclosed in the record, to hold that when he reached the southeast corner of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railway Company’s survey, and called for the northeast corner of 1158, he was mistaken as to the locality of that corner, which could not be found upon the ground; also, that in his field notes calling for a corner 1344 varas north to the bank of the river, by the expression “ bearings cut down” (which, however, is not carried into the patent), if he meant to call for the northwest corner of 1154, finding no evidence on the ground of this corner, he erroneously supposed it to be where course and distance, as called for in his field notes, had placed him. Delivered November 22, 1892. It seems to us that, under the facts disclosed in the record, according to the rules of construction adopted in this State, the court was not clearly wrong in the conclusion, which evidently must have been reached, that the call for the northeast corner of 1158 should be rejected as a mistake; though there is much force in the contention that it never was intended to leave so small a vacancy between the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado and the older surveys. The sixth assignment asserts the invalidity of the patent under which appellee claimed, because it appeared from the face of the patent that it was issued by virtue of appellee’s affidavit made before a notary public instead of a clerk either of the District Court or County Court, as required by the Act of 1873 and the amended Act of 1881. Appellants cite us to no authority except the statute in support of this assignment, and it seems to us that it is not well taken. Our conclusion is that the judgment should be affirmed. Affirmed.","J. J. Robertson et al. v. James Mooney. No. 38. 1. Survey — Presumption.—In the absence of proof to the contrary, the presumption is that the survey by virtue of which land is patented or appropriated was actually made on the ground, as required by law. 2. Boundary Lines — Construction of Calls. — The rule that a call for a line or corner of an older survey will prevail over a call for course and distance is not applicable to an unmarked line or corner which can only be found by running course and distance from some other marked line or corner or well known object. 3. Patent not Void, when. — A patent issued on a pre-emption is not void because the affidavit therefor was made before a notary public, instead of a clerk of the District or County Court, as required by the Act of 1873 and the amended Act of 1881. Appeal from Stephens. Tried below before Hon. T. H. Conner. J. R. Fleming and Wm. Veale & Son, for appellants. 1. The rules for the construction of grants and for ascertaining their boundaries are all designed to carry out the intention of the grantor. When that intention is manifest all else must yield to and be governed by it. It was manifestly the intention of the State to grant, under the patent issued on the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railroad Company survey, all the vacancy existing at the place where said survey was made. Woods v. Robinson, 58 Texas, 655; Moore v. Reiley, 68 Texas, 668; Fordtran v. Ellis, 58 Texas, 245; Oliver v. Mahoney, 61 Texas, 610: Brown v. Bedinger, 72 Texas, 248. 2. When a survey calls for adjacent grants that bound it without dispute upon four or more sides, and when five of the corners of such surveys are established and are easily, and certainly found on the ground, the boundaries of such survey must be determined by the calls for the previous adjacent grants, so as to embrace within the lines of the patent all the land lying between adjacent surveys called for in the patent as constituting the outer boundaries of the later grant. Woods v. Robinson, 58 Texas, 655; Moore v. Reiley, 68 Texas, 668. 3. The identification of the actual survey as made by the surveyor is the main inquiry. His footsteps upon the ground should always be followed, by whatever rule they may be ascertained. Stafford v. King, 30 Texas, 273; Phillips v. Ayres, 45 Texas, 601. De Berry & Wheeler, for appellee. Under all the facts shown, and the rules of law governing the construction of calls in a survey, the judgment of the lower court was correct, as the land in controversy could not properly be included in the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railroad Company’s grant."
"HEAD, Associate Justice. On January 26, 1874, duplicate certificate No. issued to the heirs of Samuel Shackelford, was located in Hill County, and a survey embracing 682 acres, including the land in controversy, was made thereon, and the field notes returned to the General Land Office. In August, 1887, these field notes were corrected so as to leave out all of the 682 acres except the 178 acres in controversy in this suit, and upon these corrected field notes patent was issuéd dated the 5th day of October, 1887. Appellants, claiming under this location and patent, filed this suit in trespass to try title against appellees in the District Court of Hill County, September 27, 1888. Appellees each pleaded not guilty and the statutes of limitation of five and ten years, but neither of them described in their pleading the particular part of the land they claim. It seems, however, from the evidence that appellee Kirkpatrick only claims 112 acres described in deed from McKinnon & Call to him, dated April 21, 1883, and recorded same day, and the appellee Huff claims 27.6 acres described in deed from McKinnon & Call to him, dated April 21, 1883, and recorded same day, and 19.8 acres described in deed from G-. Y. Tarver to him, dated July 24, 1882, and recorded same day. Appellee Allen does not seem to have claimed any part of the land upon the trial. McKinnon & Call claimed the land conveyed by them to Kirkpatrick and Huff as aforesaid under a deed from Gr. Y. Tarver to them, dated April 18, 1883, and recorded same day. This deed is for 139.8 acres, described as part of the M. B. Atkinson 200 acres survey, giving the field notes. There was also in evidence a deed from Gr. Y. Tarver to J. P. Allen, dated February 4, 1884, recorded March 19, 1884, for 25.8 acres. G. Y. Tarver claimed the land conveyed by him to Huff, McKinnon & Call, and Allen as aforesaid under a deed made by W. L. Booth, as administrator of J. R. Grover, deceased, dated March 16, 1875, and recorded July 17, 1879. In this deed the land is described as “ 200 acres of land in Hill County, Texas, lying about 6 miles northeast from Hillsboro, and located by virtue of part of M. B. Atkinson 320-acre certificate.” There is nothing in the record to show how the estate of Grover acquired any interest in this land, and this deed was introduced only to sustain the pleas of limitation. The record, however, shows that two certificates were issued; one to Milton B. Atkinson by Barnard E. Bee, Secretary of War, No. 1101, for 320 acres, which was duly approved by the Commissioner of Claims and located in Ellis County; and one to M. B. Atkinson, by James S. Gillett, Adjutant General, No. 1027, for 320 acres, which was never approved by the Commissioner of Claims, but was attempted to be located in Hill County in 1871, in two surveys of 200 acres and 120 acres respectively, and the field notes of said surveys were returned to the General Land Office during said year. Said 200 acres survey embraced the land in controversy. The Commissioner of the General Land Office held this certificate and location invalid and refused patent thereon, and subsequently issue’d patent upon the Shackelford location as aforesaid, although later in date. At the time Tarver purchased from Grover’s administrator (which was in October, 1874, although the deed was not made until 1875), one J. P. Allen had from 7 to 8 acres of the land in controversy enclosed with his own land adjoining it, and a short time after said purchase said Allen became the tenant of Tarver. As to this tenancy, Tarver testifies he' had a written contract with Allen by which the latter was to keep the land for.five years, and to protect the timber and grass, and further on he says Allen had possession of the land as his tenant until he sold it. Allen says he does not remember when he rented the land from Tarver; that he lived there before and has lived there ever since; that nothing was said as to how long he was to keep it; that he occupied the land all the time for Tarver until he purchased from him; that he was to keep it until he was dismissed as tenant, which had never been done. Nothing is said in the evidence as to whether or not Allen was regarded by the parties as the tenant of McKinnon & Call or of Kirkpatrick during the interval between their purchase and the time they took possession thereunder. All of the improvements upon the land with which Tarver was connected were upon the 25.8 acres conveyed by him to Allen in 1884. Tarver paid all taxes on the land while he claimed it, but neither Kirkpatrick nor Huff paid taxes for the year 1885 or 1886. In 1884 A. M. Allen, one of the appellees, undertook to pre-empt 160 acres on the north side of the land, and during the years 1885 and 1886 he paid the tax thereon; and verbal evidence was admitted by the court over the objection of appellants that about the time of the institution of this suit he, joined by his wife, had made deeds to Kirkpatrick and Huff for the portion of this 160 acres claimed by them respectively. McKinnon & Call do not seem to have ever had possession of the land while they claimed it, unless Allen be held to have been their tenant. Huff seems to have taken possession immediately upon his purchases. Kirkpatrick is shown to have taken possession sometime during the year 1883, but no idea is given as to the length of time that elapsed after his purchase nor the circumstances attending the delay. The case was submitted to the court without a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of appellees upon the following special findings, to-wit: “1. That the plaintiffs have by the patent, deeds, etc., in evidence the legal title to the land described in the petition. “ 2. That G-. Y. Tarver had had and held peaceable and adverse possession of said land by his tenant, using and enjoying the same, for a period of more than ten years next before the filing of this suit. “3. That the defendants and those under whom they claim have had peaceable and adverse possession of the land in dispute, cultivating and using the same and paying taxes thereon, for a period of more than five years next before the filing of this suit. “ That under the facts as here found the court finds as a matter of law that the defendants are entitled to recover under the statutes of five and ten years limitations.” And from this judgment appellants have prosecuted this appeal, and have brought the whole case here for revision upon a statement of facts as well as upon such special findings. It will be seen from the foregoing conclusions of fact that the finding of the court below to the effect that Gr. Y. Tarver held possession of the land for ten years can not be supported by the evidence. The date of Tarver’s deed was in 1875, although the order of confirmation was in October, 1874. The sale of 19.8 acres to Huff was in July, 1882, and the sale of the 139.8 acres to McKinnon & Call was in April, 1883. The sale of the 25.8 acres to J. P. Allen in February, 1884, is not in controversy, he not being a party to this suit. It will thus be seen that less than nine years had elapsed from the date of the confirmation of the sale to Tarver by the Probate Court until he had parted with all title to the land in controversy. It is true there appears in the statement of facts some general statements to the effect that Tarver purchased sometime in 1873 or 1874, and took possession by his tenant some four or five months thereafter, but we do not regard this as entitled to any consideration in fixing these dates, when they are definitely shown by the record. But even if it had been shown that Tarver had possession years before 1874, it could not avail in this case. It will be noticed that the location upon which the patent was issued under which appellants claim was not made until January 26, 1874, and that limitation would not run against such title until this date is well settled in this State. Wood v. Welder, 42 Texas, 410; Kimbro v. Hamilton, 28 Texas, 565. The finding of fact made by the court below as to the five years statute is also defective, in that it does not show that appellees were claiming under deeds duly registered, and it will therefore be necessary- for us to investigate as to the rights of the parties as disclosed by the statement of facts. The finding of the court that Tarver held possession for ten years we think can fairly be construed as a finding that Allen, from sometime in 1874 until Tarver sold the land, was the tenant of the latter, and that his possession was of such notoriety as to fulfill the requirements of the statute of limitations if continued for the requisite time; but we have already seen that Tarver did not hold for ten years after the location appellees seek to prescribe against before he sold; and to complete the bar it will be necessary to supplement his possession with that of his vendees, if the facts will authorize this to be done. As to the 19.8 acres conveyed by Tarver to Huff July 24, 1882, we think the record sufficiently shows that there was no such break in the possession as would stop the running of the statute, and that as to this part of the land the bar is complete, and the judgment to that extent should be affirmed; but as to the remainder of the land there is more difficulty. When Tarver sold to McKinnon & Call it does not appear from the record either that they took actual possession themselves or that Allen was to continue to hold it for them as their tenant. The land so conveyed seems to have included none of the improvements claimed by either Tarver or Allen. If Allen had been in actual possession of the part of the land conveyed to McKinnon & Call, and had continued such possession during the three, or four days they kept the land, we would have no difficulty in holding that during this time he would be considered their tenant, and his possession their possession, so as to prevent any break in the running of the statute. Brownson v. Scanlan, 59 Texas, 227; Heflin v. Burns, 70 Texas, 353. But this does not seem to have been the nature of Allen’s possession. He seems only to have been looking after this part of the land for Tarver while he owned it, in consideration of the use of a small part of the tract in his own enclosure, and when Tarver’s title ceased he does not seem to have considered that he had anything further to do with it. When the unimproved part of a tract of land is severed by sale from the improvements, ordinarily the statute ceases to run as to the part that is unimproved. Cunningham v. Frandtzen, 26 Texas, 38. In this case the record does not show that McKinnon & Call ever expected to take actual possession of the land, so as to raise the question whether or not they would be allowed a reasonable time in which to do this; nor does it appear that they were in any way acting for Kirkpatrick and Huff in making the purchase from Tarver, so as to connect their possession direct with his, as seems to have been done in the case of Ileflin v. Burns, 70 Texas,-353, cited above. So far as we can see from the record, there was a complete break in the possession at McKinnon & Call as to the land conveyed to them by Tarver, which includes the 112 acres claimed by Kirkpatrick and the 27.6 acres tract claimed by Huff in this suit. It also seems that Kirkpatrick took possession-of the 112 acres claimed by him in 1883, but how long in said year after he purchased from McKinnon & Call does not appear. Where land is in the actual possession of the owner, a reasonable time under all the circumstances will be allowed upon its sale for the purchaser to take possession before a break in the running of the statute will be declared. Whitehead v.-Foley, 28 Texas, 15. But in this case there is not sufficient in the record to enable us to say that the length of time taken by Kirkpatrick was reasonable, even though there had been no break at McKinnon & Call. We are neither informed as to the length of time taken by him, nor as to the circumstances under which it was taken. What we have said as to the break in possession at McKinnon & Call applies also to the claims of Kirkpatrick and Huff under the five years statute. Tarver’s deed was not recorded until July 17, 1879, and therefore five years had not elapsed before his conveyance to McKinnon <fc Call, April 18, 1883, when the break occurred. Kirkpatrick and Huff each took possession under recorded deeds in 1883, and have remained in possession since that time; so that more than five years may have elapsed after the beginning of such possession before the institution of this suit. But neither of them paid taxes on the land for the years 1885 and 1886. To remedy this they seek to show that they have acquired the title of A. M. Allen, who did pay for those years. The answer to this is: 1. When Allen paid these taxes he neither had possession nor claimed the land under a registered deed.. 2. The evidence showed that the conveyance from Allen and wife to Kirkpatrick and Huff were both in writing; and if this evidence was offered to show that title had passed by the conveyance, the deeds should have been produced, and appellants’ objection on account of their nonproduction should have been sustained. 3. To enable Kirkpatrick and Huff to tack their possession under the McKinnon & Call title to the title acquired from Allen it would be necessary for them to show that the Allen title was also registered. In other words, possession, payment of taxes, and registered deed must all concur to make the statute available. As said in Whitehead v. Foley, 28 Texas, 289: “A party who claims to have acquired a title to the land of another, with no other evidence of right than a possession of five years under a deed recorded, ought to show a compliance with the terms prescribed by the statute perfect in every particular.” Appellants also contend that the possession of J. P. Allen by reason of his having 7 to 8 acres of the land in his own enclosure was not sufficient to make the statute apply to the remainder of the tract, and cite Bracken v. Jones, 63 Texas, as authority. In that case the one whose fence was over the line did not profess to hold for the one who claimed the remainder of the tract; while in this there was an express tenancy, with the understanding that the possession of the tenant should extend to the whole tract, and, as we said above, we think the finding of the court upon this point sustained by the evidence. Brownson v. Scanlan, 59 Texas, 226. Appellants also contend that the description of the land in the deed from the administrator of Grover to Tarver is not sufficient under the five years statute. The description in this deed is as follows. “Two hundred acres of land in Hill County, Texas, lying about six miles northeast from Hillsboro, and located by virtue of part of M. B. Atkinson 320 acres certificate.” By the other evidence in the record it is made plain that this comprised the whole of the survey at that place, and the deed did not refer to 200 acres to be taken out of a larger tract. In Flanagan v. Boggess, 46 Texas, 335, the following description in a tax deed was held sufficient as a basis for prescription under the five years statute, to-wit: “Six hundred and twenty acres of the headright of David Brown, situate about twelve miles north of Henderson, in the neighborhood of Bellview.” We think the reasoning of the court in holding this description good in that case has peculiar application to this, and we therefore hold the deed sufficient. Appellees have also filed cross-assignments calling in question the sufficiency of appellants’ title to entitle them to judgment, even though the defense of limitation should fail. Their first contention is, that the evidence shows the location of the Atkinson certificate to be older than the Shackelford, upon which appellants’ patent was issued, and that the Commissioner of the General Land Office was in error in holding that certificate and location invalid. It will be noticed that appellees in no way connect themselves with the Atkinson location, and only seek to avail themselves of it as an outstanding-title. Delivered October 25, 1892. It has long been settled in this State that an outstanding equity will not avail a stranger thereto in defense against the legal title. Shields v. Hunt, 45 Texas, 424; Gullett v. O’Connor, 54 Texas, 416. The last case cited is peculiarly in point and conclusive in holding that even though it be conceded that the Atkinson location was valid and prior in time to the Shackelford, it would not avail appellees in defense against the legal title evidenced by the patent issued upon the latter. The second contention of appellees in their attack upon the title of appellants is, that the corrected field notes on the Shackelford location returned to the Land Office in 1887 was not a correction, but a relocation, and was therefore upon a certificate barred by the Constitution. All of the land embraced in the last field notes was included in the survey made in 1874, and we are of opinion that they were properly treated as corrections and not as relocations. Railway v. Thompson, 65 Texas, 190. At any rate it was necessary for the Commissioner to decide as to whether this was a legitimate correction before he issued the patent thereon; and even if it be conceded that he made an erroneous ruling as to this, it would not make the patent void, but at most it would only be voidable when attacked by the proper parties, and it could not be taken advantage of by appellees, who are strangers to both locations. Gullett v. O’Connor, 54 Texas, 416; League v. Rogan, 59 Texas, 430; Decourt v. Sproul, 66 Texas, 368. The appellee A. M. Allen having filed a plea of not guilty as to all of the land sued for, and not having offered any evidence of title, and the court having found that appellants had the legal paper title to all of the land sued for by them, judgment should have been rendered in their favor against said Allen, and it will be so rendered here. Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that judgment should here be rendered affirming the judgment below in favor of appellee Z. T. Huff as to the 19.8 acres conveyed to him by G. T. Tarver, July 24, 1882; that the judgment in favor of appellee A. M. Allen should be reversed and here rendered in favor of appellants against said Allen as to all the land sued for by them; that the judgment below in favor of appellee Kirkpatrick, and in favor of appellee Huff as to the 27.6 acres conveyed to him by McKinnon & Call, April 21, 1883, should be reversed and remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded. Chief Justice Tarlton did not sit in this case.","Tarlton, Jordan & Tarlton v. W. A. Kirkpatrick et al. No. 6. 1. Limitation. — As against title under a certificate, limitation does not begin to run until the date of the location of the certificate. 2. Same — Five and Ten Years Statute— Break in Possession.— Where the unimproved part of a tract of land is severed by sale from the improvements, ordinarily the statute ceases to run as to the part that is unimproved. Where land is in the actual possession of the owner, a reasonable time under all the circumstances will be allowed upon its sale for the purchaser to take possession, before a break in the running of the statute will be declared. 3. Five Years Statute — Payment of Taxes. — Where one pleading the five years statute seeks to account for his failure to pay taxes for two years by showing that another under whom he claims did pay the taxes for those years, he must show that such other person was then in actual possession, claiming under deed duly registered, else he can not tack his own possession to the title acquired from such other person. 4. Limitation — Possession.—Enclosure and cultivation of a small part of a tract of land under a lease of the whole tract, held, under the facts, to constitute actual possession of the entire tract. 5. Deed — Description of Land. — The description in the deed was as follows: “ Two hundred acres of land in Hill County, Texas, lying about six miles northeast from Hillsboro, and located by virtue of part of M. E. Atkinson 320 acres certificate.” Held, a sufficient description under the five years statute; the 200 acres being the whole of the survey at that place. 6. Trespass to Try Title — Outstanding Equity. — An outstanding equity with which the defendant does not connect himself will not avail as a defense against the legal title asserted by plaintiff. 7. Patent, Not Void when. — If the second set of field notes constituted a relocation, then the certificate was barred; otherwise, not. The Commissioner in issuing the patent decided the second field notes to be merely a correction of the original survey which was made in time. Even if this was error, it would not make the patent void and subject to collateral attack. Appeal from Johnson. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. The opinion states the ease. V. H. & Thos. Ivy, for appellants. 1. The court erred in deciding that Gr. Y. Tarver had had and held peaceable and adverse possession of the land by his tenant for more than ten years next before the filing of the suit. The relation of landlord and tenant was broken when Tarver conveyed to McKinnon & Call. Chandler v. Rushing, 38 Texas, 591. 2. J. P. Allen lived on his own pre-emption, his fence overlapping seven or eight acres on the land in suit. This overlapping did not constitute actual possession beyond such enclosure. Bracken v. Jones, 63 Texas, 184. 3. Defendants did not show an exclusive adverse possession for five years under Booth’s deed to Tarver, A. M. Allen having pre-empted and adversely claimed and possessed part of the land for about three years of the time. Richards v. Smith, 67 Texas, 610; Chandler v. Rushing, 38 Texas, 591. 4. The description of the land in the deed from Booth to Tarver was not sufficient to support the pleas of limitation. Brokel v. McKechnie, 69 Texas, 32; Murphy v. Welder, 58 Texas, 235. 5. Plaintiffs were entitled to judgment against A. M. Allen, he having pleaded the general issue and failed to show any character of title. McKinnon & Carlton, for appellees. 1. The finding of the court that defendants and their vendors had held peaceable and adverse possession for more than ten years previous to the filing of the suit was correct. Craig v.

The certificate was first surveyed January 26, 1874, and the corrected field notes were not made until August 29, 1887. These last field notes were not, in fact, a correction of the first, but were new and different field notes, and at their date the certificate was barred by constitutional limitation. Rev.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. This appeal is from a judgment in a garnishment in favor of the appellee, Henry Ash, and against appellants, who were judgment creditors of one Theo. Ash. To the judgment of the court, and to its previous rulings upon motions made by appellants, numerous objections are urged. The first error assigned is, that the court erred in granting garnishee leave and further time to answer writ of garnishment, after having sustained appellants’ exceptions to garnishee’s original answer, and in refusing to render judgment for appellants for their debt, against garnishee, upon motion of appellants made to the court when it sustained their exceptions to the answer, on May 1, 1891. The garnishee was served with a copy of appellants’ garnishment on the 17th day of December, 1890, and on the 24th day of April, 1891, at •the next term of the court after the service of garnishment, appellee answered, that on the 17th day of December, 1890, he was not indebted to defendant Theo. Ash, nor was he then indebted to him; that on the 17th day of December, 1890, he was in possession of two certain lots of merchandise and some money, and that he held the same by virtue of a certain deed of trust executed by Theo. Ash on the 15th day of December, 1890; and by said deed of trust he, the said Henry Ash, was authorized to sell said goods in due course of trade until sufficient money was realized to pay off certain debts in said deed specified, and if such sum was not realized by the 1st day of May, 1891, he was to sell the remainder of the goods at public auction; that a sufficient sum had not been realized to pay the debts, and that he was unable to say what amount of money would be realized until after he had disposed of the balance of the goods; that they would be sold for cash to the highest bidder on the 2nd day of May proximo, and he prayed for time until after said sale in which to make further answer; and he further answered that he knew of no other person who was indebted to Theo. Ash, or who had in his possession effects belonging to him. This answer is not as full and specific as such an answer should be, and the court was right in sustaining exceptions to it. But it is insisted, that it is so defective that the court should have treated it as a confession by the garnishee, and rendered judgment for the debt of appellants. To this we can not assent. The garnishee can not be said to have refused or neglected to make answer to either of the inquiries propounded to him in the writ. When the answer of a garnishee- is defective, and exceptions to it are sustained, it does not follow that the court must treat the pleading as no answer, and visit upon the garnishee the penalty of failing or refusing to answer the writ. We do not think such a proposition can be sustained upon reason or by authority. The case cited by counsel (Freeman v. Miller, 51 Texas, 443,) does not sustain the position. In that case the garnishee failed to answer one of the two questions embodied in article 192, Revised Statutes. We think the-court did not err in refusing to render judgment for appellants, nor do we think there was error in granting appellee leave to file his amended answer at a later day of the term, and after the sale at auction of the remainder of the goods. The next objection to the ruling of the court is, that the court refused the motion of appellants, made and heard on the 18th day of May, 1891, to compel Theo. Ash, their judgment debtor, and for whom a subpoena duces tecum had been issued on the 27th of April, 1891, to produce and bring into court his books and invoices showing his mercantile transactions from July 1, 1890, to December 15, 1890. Without here deciding whether in a proper case it would be the duty of the court to sustain such motion, it is sufficient answer to this objection to say, that this court is not in possession of data sufficient to enable us to determine whether or not there was error in refusing the motion. The record discloses the fact that Theo. Ash had ceased to be a resident of Anderson County, and was a resident of the city of San Antonio, and that the books and papers desired were in that city. From the facts before us, we can not therefore hold that the court would have been justified in compelling Theo. Ash, under the pains and penalties of contempt, to produce his books and papers into court. The appellants, on the 21st day of May, just three days after their motion had been overruled, announced ready for trial when this cause was called for trial, and the trial proceeded. Had they on that day made a motion supported by proper affidavit for a continuance or postponement of the trial to a later day of the term, for the purpose of producing the desired books and papers to be used as evidence, we would have another and a different question before us. The objections urged by appellee to this motion, that Theo. Ash is not a party to this suit, and that the books and papers are his private property, and therefore he can not be compelled to bring them into court, nor can the appellants use them as evidence in support of their contest with the garnishee, we dó not think are good. It is true that Theo. Ash is not nominally a party to this suit, but he is the judgment debtor of appellants, who are in this suit endeavoring to subject to the payment of their judgment property which they aver has been fraudulently conveyed to appellee. This suit is then but auxiliary to their former suit with Theo. Ash, and he has an interest in the issues formed between the parties to this suit; and he has certainly an interest in the property conveyed to the appellee, since the conveyance is but a mortgage and not an assignment. We take it then that Theo. Ash, though not joined as a party defendant with the garnishee, is a party in interest. But even third persons who have in their possession books or papers in which one of the parties have an interest may be compelled to produce them; and by interest, as the word is here used, we understand that if the documents are material evidence, for the party demanding them, such party has an interest in them, and their production may be compelled by either bill of discovery or by subpoena duces tecum. 3 Greenl., sec. 305. To this rule there are of course exceptions, but this case, in our judgment, does not fall within any of these exceptions. That these books and papers would be admissible in evidence for the purpose of contradicting the re: citáis in the deed, is we think manifest. This deed, as we have before remarked, is not an assignment; it does not convey the property to the creditors, and the law applicable to purchasers for valuable consideration from a fraudulent vendor does not apply to this case. When property is purchased for a valuable consideration from an insolvent debtor, and the conveyance is attacked as fraudulent by a creditor, it devolves upon him attacking the conveyance to show, first, that the conveyance was made by the vendor with the fraudulent intent to hinder or delay his creditors in the collection of their debts; and second, that this intent was known to the purchaser. But when the conveyance is made in trust to a third party for the benefit of certain preferred creditors, it is then immaterial whether this intent was or was not known to either the trustee or to the beneficiaries; and if the deed was executed with the intent to “ delay, hinder, or defraud creditors,” it is void. Baldwin v. Peet, 22 Texas, 710. Says Judge Roberts, in the case cited above: “ The assent of creditors to a general assignment will be presumed, so as to give it effect, although they may know nothing of it when it is made; but when the assignment is made with fraudulent intent the assent of the creditors will not be presumed, and such deed is inoperative and void as to creditors, although the fraudulent intent was unknown to the trustee.” The case of Baldwin v. Peet was one in which Baldwin sought by injunction to restrain a creditor from making his judgment by sale under execution of goods, wares, and merchandise in Baldwin’s possession, and which he was holding under an assignment made for the benefit of his creditors by an insolvent debtor, and the deed of conveyance was attacked by the execution creditor as fraudulent; and upon the trial in the lower court the jury were instructed, that if the deed was made with the fraudulent intent to delay, hinder, or defraud the creditors of the vendor, it was void, and that it was ‘1 immaterial whether that intent was known or not to the trustee.” And upon appeal to the Supreme Court that court declared that such charge was not erroneous. The language of the statute of frauds would seem to rebut the idea that the party attacking a deed made upon good consideration only, such as the one under discussion, must, in addition to proving a fraudulent intent on the part of the vendor, show that that intent was known to the trustee. Article 2465, Revised Statutes, after denouncing as null and void conveyances made with the intent to defraud, delay, or hinder creditors, purchasers, or other persons of or from what they are or may be lawfully entitled to, shall as to such creditors, purchasers, or other persons, their representatives or assigns, be. void, concludes with. this declaration: ‘ ‘ This article shall not affect the title of a purchaser for valuable consideration, unless it appear that he had notice of the fraudulent intent of his immediate grantor, or of the fraud rendering void the title of such grantor.” The only issue between the appellants and the garnishee, as we understand the law to be, was, what was the intention of Theo. Ash in making the conveyance? If the intention to hinder and delay the creditors influenced him, in whole or in part, as an object of making the deed, the deed would be void. If, on the other hand, to hinder and delay his creditors was only contemplated as an incident, and his real purpose and object in making the conveyance was to pay debts due the parties named in the conveyance, the deed would be valid. Vide Baldwin v. Peet, and authorities therein cited. Upon this issue, and upon it alone, rested the right of the appellants to subject the property conveyed to the appellee to the payment of their judgment against Theo. Ash, although the case was tried, it seems, upon the assumption by both appellants and appellee, that the deed would be valid, notwithstanding it might have been made with intent to hinder and delay his creditors by Theo. Ash, unless it was shown that such intent on the part of Theo. Ash was known to Henry Ash, the trustee. Holding the view we do, as expressed above, as to what was the issue between the parties, our conclusion is, that it was the right and the privilege of the appellants to inspect the books and invoices named in their motion, and to put them in evidence if they should contain anything which was relevant and material to the matter in issue, and that Theo. Ash, if he was guilty of disobeying the subpoena duces tecum, was in contempt of court, and upon a proper showing it would have been the duty of the court to compel him to produce the desired books and invoices. The objections of the appellants to the judgment of the court, upon the ground that the deed was fraudulent per se, we hold to be not good. The deed contains nothing which of itself would make the conveyance absolutely void. The rule laid down in Baldwin v. Peet, that a conveyance is not fraudulent per se unless it contains a provision or clause by which some benefit or advantage is reserved to the debtor at the expense of the creditors, or unless the instrument by inherent defects is inoperative as a conveyance, has been recognized and observed in an unbroken chain of decisions by the Supreme Court of this State, and is still the law, except so far as modified by the Act of 1879, regulating assignments. And applying the testas prescribed in that rule to the deed under consideration, it can not be said to be fraudulent upon its face, and the court would not have been justified in declaring it void for any of its provisions. The authority given the trustee to employ attorneys and to carry on the business for four and one-half months, and the diiection that after the debts are paid any remainder of goods or balance of money arising from their sale should be turned over to the maker of the deed, are all badges of fraud, but none of these provisions, or all of them combined, make the deed void. They are simply facts tending to establish the fraudulent intent of the maker of the deed. The case of Gallagher & Co. v. Goldfrank, Frank & Co., cited by counsel in support of his first proposition under fourth error assigned, is not in conflict with the case of Baldwin v. Feet and other decisions in accord with the decision in that case. In the case cited the trustee was authorized to sell in the usual course of trade for an indefinite time; in the case under consideration the trustee is only authorized to continue to sell in due course of trade until May 1, 1891. Appellee’s counter-proposition to second proposition under fifth and sixth errors, to-wit, “A writ of garnishment served, upon a trustee in charge of goods for the benefit of preferred creditors will reach only such surplus as may remain in the trustee’s hands after executing his trust,” is entirely correct, we think, when the deed is valid; but the proposition is not sound when applied to a deed which is invalid because executed with the intent to defraud or to delay or hinder creditors. In the case of Carter v. Bush, 79 Texas, 29, there was no charge of fraud in the execution of the deed of trust under which the garnishee was holding and disposing of the property conveyed by the debtor. We hold with the appellants, that if the deed of trust in this case is void for fraud, and the trustee had notice that the same would be contested by nonpreferred creditors, and he afterwards, without an order of court, disposed of the goods, he acted in his own wrong, and is liable to the appellants for the value of the goods in his hands at the date of notice given after the service of the writ of garnishment. Vide Morris v. House, 32 Texas, 492. Nor do we concur in the counter-proposition to first proposition under eighth assignment of error. We hold that if any of the debts recited in a deed of trust made for preferred creditors be false and fictitious in whole or in part, and it be so charged in the pleading of the attacking creditor, the deed is void for fraud. Vide Brasher v. Jameson, Gregg & Co., 75 Texas, 139, and Blair v. Finlay & Brunswig, 75 Texas, 210. And it matters not whether the other creditors, whose claims are just and true, know of the fact or not. Where an erroneous statement as to the amount of a debt has been unin tentiortally made, or where through inadvertence a debt is recited in the deed as still subsisting which has been paid or against which there is a setoff, such misstatements may be satisfactorily explained, and if so explained they should not avoid the instrument. Delivered November 3, 1892. We deem it unnecessary, in view of the disposition we must make of the caso, to consider the other assignments of error, and their counter - propositions, presented in the briefs of counsel. After a careful consideration of the whole case, we think that the judgment of the lower court should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial; and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded. Justice Williams did not sit in this case.","FIRST DISTRICT, NOVEMBER, 1892. H. T. Simon, Gregory & Co. v. Henry Ash. No. 6. 1. Garnishment — Insufficient Answer. —The garnishee being served with the writ December 17, 1890, on April 24,1891, answered, that he was not on the 17th of December nor at this time indebted to Theo. Ash. the judgment debtor, and that he knew of no other person who was indebted to him, or had in his possession effects of Theo. Ash. That on the 17th day of December, 1890, he was in possession of two lots of merchandise and some money, and held the same by virtue of a certain deed of trust executed by Theo. Ash on the 15th day of December, 1890, and that by said deed he was authorized to sell said goods in. due course of trade until sufficient money was realized to pay off certain debts in said deed specified, and if such sum was not realized by the first of May, 1891, he was to sell the remainder of the goods at auction. That a sufficient sum had not been realized to pay the debts, and he was unable to say what amount would be realized until after he had disposed of the balance of the goods, and praying for time until after said sale to make further answer. Held, not as full and specific as it should have been, and exception to it rightfully sustained. 2. Same — Amendment of. — When exceptions to the answer of the garnishee are sustained it does not follow that the pleading should be treated as nd answer, and there was no error in granting leave to amend at a later day of the term, and after the sale of the remainder of the goods; 3. Enforcement of Subpoena Duces Tecum. — Subpoena having been issued and served on the 27th April, on May 18 motion was made to compel the witness Theo. Ash, the judgment debtor, to bring his account and invoice books into court. The books and papers were in San Antonio, of which city Ash was a resident. Held, not error to refuse the motion, there not being sufficient data to authorize an opinion otherwise. Had a continuance been asked for want of this evidence a different question would have been presented. 4. Same — Defenses to, Insufficient. — It was not a good answer in this case to a motion to compel obedience to the subpoena duces tecum, that the books and papers asked for are the private property of the witness, and that he is not a party to the suit. Though not joined as a party he is a party in interest, the trust deed made by him being attacked for fraud, and the garnishment being auxiliary to the plaintiffs' suit against him. 5. Subpoena Duces Tecum. — Even third parties who have in their possession books or papers which are material evidence for the party demanding them may be compelled to produce them by subpoena duces tecum or bill of discovery, and when a proper showing of their relevancy and materiality is made, it will be the right and privilege of appellants to inspect the books and invoices of Theo. Ash, and to put them in evidence, and it would be the duty of the court to compel him to produce them. 6. Fraudulent Conveyance — Notice of Intent. — When property is purchased for a valuable consideration from an insolvent debtor and the conveyance is attacked as fraudulent by a creditor, it devolves upon him to prove, first, that the conveyance was made by the vendor with the fraudulent intent to hinder or delay Ms creditors in the collection of their debts; and second, that this intent was known to the purchaser. But when the conveyance is made in trust to a third party for the benefit of certain preferred creditors, it is then immaterial whether this intent was known to either the trustee or the beneficiaries, and if the deed was executed with the intent to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors it is void. Approving Baldwin v. Beet, 22 Texas, 710. 7. Statute of Frauds. — The language of the statute, article 2465, would seem to rebut the idea that the party attacking the deed made upon good consideration only must, in addition to proving a fraudulent intent on the part of the vendor, show that that intent was known to the trustee. It declares: “ This article shall not affect the title of a.purchaser for valuable consideration unless he has notice of the fraudulent intent of his immediate grantor, or of the fraud rendering void the title of such grantor."" 8. Intention of the Grantor the Controlling Issue. —If the intention to hinder and delay the creditors influenced the grantor, in whole or in part, as an object in making the deed, it would be void; but if to hinder and delay his creditors was only contemplated as an incident, and his real purpose and object was to pay the debts due the parties named in the conveyance, the deed would be valid. 9. Fraud per se. — A conveyance is not fraudulent per se, unless it contains a provision or clause by which some benefit or advantage is reserved to the debtor at the expense of the creditors, or unless the instrument by reason of inherent defects is inoperative as a conveyance. Tested by this rule the trust deed in this case is not void. The authority given the trustee to employ attorneys. and to carry on the business for four and a half months, and to turn over the residue of the money arising from the sale to the debtor, are all badges of fraud, but do not render the deed void. 10. Liability of Garnishee. — A writ of garnishment served upon a trustee in oharge'of goods for the benefit of creditors, under a valid trust deed, will reach only the surplus remaining after executing the trust; but if the deed is void for fraud, and the trustee had notice that the same would be contested by nonpreferred creditors, and he afterward, without an order of court, disposes of the goods, he acts in his own wrong, and is liable for their value at the date of notice. 11. Fictitious Debts Secured. — If any of the debts recited in a deed of trust made for preferred creditors be false or fictitious in whole or in part, and it be so charged in the pleading of the attacking creditor and proved, the deed is void for fraud, whether the other creditors whose debts are just knew of the fact or not. Misstatements made through mistake or inadvertence, however, if satisfactorily explained, should not avoid the instrument. Appeal from Anderson. Tried below before Hon. F. A. Williams. The opinion and propositions in briefs sufficiently state' the case. Gammage & Gammage, for appellants. 1. The court, on the 1st day of May, 1891, having sustained plaintiffs’ exceptions, filed April 25, 1891, to defendant-garnishee’s answer, filed April 24, 1891, erred in granting defendant-garnishee leave and further time to answer said writ of garnishment; and erred in refusing to render judgment for plaintiffs for the amount of their debt as prayed for in said motion, because the proofs and record show that the defendant had ample time in which to make full answer to said writ, and that it was his intention not to answer fully as required by law said writ, and no grounds are shown authorizing the granting of further time. Rev. Stats., arts. 186, 192, 194, 1192; Freeman v. Miller, 51 Texas, 443; Waples on Att., 368, see. 6. 2. The court erred in refusing to grant the peremptory order asked by plaintiffs in writing, filed May 18, 1891, commanding Theo. Ash to produce and bring into court the books and papers set out in subpoena duces tecum, issued April 27, 1891, and executed April 29, 1891. 2 Bouv. Law Dic., 535, 536; 1 Bouv. Law Dic.

Renick, 11 Texas, 134; Hall v. York, 16 Texas, 18. 3. The court erred in rendering judgment for defendant-garnishee. The deed or mortgage is by its terms and provisions void as against plaintiffs in this suit; it operates to hinder and delay plaintiffs in the collection of their debt. By its provisions it creates other large and increased liabilities and charges against the estate .of grantor in the nature of attorney fees, clerk hire, house rent, insurance, taxes, and other expenses. It provided the estate should be sold in due and regular course of trade, etc., until May 1, 1891, and then sell the balance in bulk, thereby putting the same beyond the reach of his creditors as well as increasing the amount of his indebtedness; and it further provided that the balance of the funds realized for said property, after paying expenses and named preferences, be paid to him, the said Theo. Ash, in fraud of plaintiffs. Rev. Stats., arts. 186, 192, 2465; Wait on Fraud. Con., secs. 11, 231, 242, 318;, 2 Bige. on Fraud, 293, 375, 377, 564, 565; Gallagher v.

If the deed of trust was void for fraud, and Henry Ash had notice that the same would be contested by nonpreferred creditors, and he after-wards disposed of the effects in his hands without an order of the court so to do, he acted in his own wrong, and is liable to the creditors for full value of the effects he had in his possession on the date of the service of the writ of garnishment and other notice. Waples on Gar. and Att., 376, 377; Morris v. House, 32 Texas, 492. 5. The court erred in finding against plaintiffs and for Henry Ash, garnishee, and ordering his discharge, for the reason that the evidence in said cause showed that the debts named in said deed of trust of December 15, 18.90, to John R. Woodward, Alf. Ash, and Margaret Ash, preferred creditors, were in fact not existing, but fictitious and fraudulent. Wait on Fraud. Con., secs. 228, 345; Brasher v. Jamison, 75 Texas, 139; Bank v.

An interlocutory order refusing to compel a witness to produce documents in answer to a subpoena duces tecum will not be reviewed without a bill of exceptions disclosing the evidence upon which the court acted. 3. A deed of trust on a stock of goods to preferred creditors does not hinder or delay creditors because it provides for the payment out of the proceeds of the goods of all necessary expenses of selling such goods, nor because it authorizes sale at retail for four months during the season of the year when the goods will probably realize more than by an immediate sale in bulk, nor because it provides that the surplus, after satisfying the trust, shall be paid over to the maker. Jackson v. Harby, 65 Texas, 714; 70 Texas, 410; Gallagher v. Goldfrank, 75 Texas, 565; Styles v. Hill, Fontaine & Co., 62 Texas, 429. 4. A deed of trust or mortgage taken by a bona fide creditor on property of his insolvent debtor is not invalid because the creditor knew of such insolvency, or knew that the necessary effect of the mortgage was to hinder and delay other creditors. Ellis v. Valentine & Son, 65 Texas, 532. 5. An overstatement of the amount of the debt secured in a trust deed, giving a preference to such debt, is subject to explanation, and does not render such instrument void unless there was intent to defraud, in which both parties participated. The innocent creditor will be protected to the extent of his debt. So an overstatement of one of the debts in an instrument giving a preference to several debts, fraudulently inserted, or the fraudulent insertion of a fictitious debt, will not avoid such instrument as to the other creditors not sharing in the fraud.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. Appellees, S. A. Lillard & Co., brought this suit in the District Court of Wise County, upon a promissory note in the sum of $100, against W. H. Cox, as maker of said note, and sought to foreclose an alleged vendor’s lien on 80 acres of land situated in said county, against appellant, Jot Gunter, and his tenant, J. E. Cook. At the February Term, 1890, of said court, a judgment was rendered in favor of appellees for the amount of the note against Cox, and against the other defendants, foreclosing the lien on said land; the defendant Cox having made default and Cook having filed a disclaimer. The cause was tried without a jury, and is brought here by appellant, without any statement of facts, upon the trial court’s conclusions of law and fact. It appears from the bill of exceptions in the record that plaintiffs below read in evidence, over the objection of appellant on the ground of a variance, the note upon which the suit was founded, which by its terms was made payable as follows, “ to bearer E. I-I. or W. D. Wheeler.” This note had been attached to the first amended original petition, to which it was at that time still attached. The suit was tried upon a second amended original petition, which is the only petition of appellees in the record; and in that petition the note was described as being payable to the “ bearer or E. H. & W. D. Wheeler.” The note in this second amended petition was otherwise accurately and fully described, and was referred to as being thereto attached. Besides assigning error upon the admission of this evidence, appellant made the following assignment: ‘1 The court erred in holding that the notes sued on are secured by a vendor’s lien upon the land in controversy.” No other assignments are contained in appellant’s brief. We here refer to and adopt the conclusions of fact filed in the court below as our conclusions of fact. Appellant insists that the court erred in overruling his objection to the introduction in evidence of the note sued upon, on the ground of a variance between it and the description of it in the petition, and cites us to the case of Warren v. Scott, 32 Iowa, 22. In that case the promise was, to “ pay to the bearer, M. C. Murdough,” and it was held that its legal effect was the same as though the word “ bearer ” had been omitted. It seems to us that there is a difference in the effect of the language employed in that note and the one herein sued upon. As we construe this note, it is equivalent to a promise to pay to E. H. Wheeler or W. D. Wheeler or bearer, and is a negotiable note. The one described in the petition is correctly interpreted by appellant to read to E. H. Wheeler and W. D. Wheeler or bearer. The note as described and the note as introduced in evidence are alike negotiable and payable to bearer, and are substantially the same. Certain it is, that there is no such difference between them as to mislead or surprise appellant, which is the test laid down by our Supreme Court. Patterson v. Taylor, 64 Texas, 55. As bearing upon this question of surprise, we think that the fact of its being filed as an exhibit to the pleading, superseded by the second amendment, and again referred to in the said second amendment as attached thereto, might be properly considered without violating any of the rules of pleading prescribed for the District Court. Delivered November 15, 1892. The appellees object to our considering the propositions submitted by appellant under the assignment quoted above. We are of opinion that this assignment is too general. The matter in litigation in the trial court involved the validity of the alleged lien on the land in controversy. Nothing else was controverted. We think this assignment is equivalent to an assertion that the court erred in rendering judgment against appellant. He caused the court to file conclusions of law and fact, in which were set forth the different grounds upon which the judgment foreclosing said lien was rested. We think if appellant desired us to review, any of these several grounds or propositions he should have designated by his assignment the ground or grounds of error relied upon; otherwise, conclusions of law and fact would be useless. We have, however, examined the record sufficiently to satisfy us that no material error was committed by the court below in foreclosing said lien. It'is concluded that the judgment appealed from should in all things be affirmed. Affirmed.","Jot Gunter v. S. A. Lillard & Co. No. 29. 1. Pleading Note — Variance. — The note sued on was described in the pleading as payable to “the bearer or E. IT. & W. D. Wheeler.” As offered in evidence it was payable “to bearer E. EL or W. D. Wheeler.” Held, there was no material variance. 2. Same — Exhibit—Surprise.—Where the note sued on was attached to the original petition, and in an amended petition, on which the case was tried, was referred to as “ attached thereto,” though not in fact attached, the mistake in describing the note as above stated could not be a ground of surprise to the defendant. 3. Assignment of Error. —That “the court erred in holding that the notes sued on are secured by a vendor’s lien upon the land in controversy,” is an assignment of error too general to be entitled to consideration. Appeal from Wise. Tried below before Hon. J. W. Patterson. Robertson & Coke, for appellant. 1. There was variance between the note as pleaded and that as proved. 1 Greenl. on Ev., sec. 66; Dist. Ct.

Taylor, 64 Texas, 55, 56. 2.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This suit was brought by the appellee,. S. E. Jones, in the County Court of Cherokee County, against the appellant, James A. Campbell, on a promissory note executed by Campbell, payable to Kirby & Jones, a firm of retail liquor dealers doing business in the town of Jacksonville, in said county. Plaintiff claimed to be a holder of said note by indorsement before maturity, for value, and without notice of any defense thereto against the original payees. Defendant admitted the execution of the note, but pleaded in bar thereof, that it was void because it was executed in consideration of intoxicating liquors sold to the defendant by the said Kirby & Jones, in violation of the conditions of the bond executed by them as licensed retail liquor dealers, that they would not sell any intoxicating liquor to an habitual drunkard, nor to any person after having received notice from the wife, mother, sister, or daughter not to sell such person intoxicating liquor. In the charge the court defined the term ‘1 habitual drunkard” as de- . fined in Revised Statutes, article 2473, of the title on guardian and ward, as “ one whose mind has become so impaired by the use of intoxicating liquors or drugs that he is incapable of taking care of himself or property.” This was error. The definition in the statute relating to guardianship is for the purpose of determining when a guardian of the person and estate shall be appointed, and does not apply to the meaning of the term as used in the statute providing for the execution of a bond by persons obtaining license as retail liquor dealers. Sayles’ Ann. Stats., art. 3226a, sec. 4. It is here used in its common acceptation, and the capacity of the person to take care of himself or property is not in issue and is immaterial. The jury must determine from the common understanding of the term as to whether or not the person is an habitual drunkard. Trigg v. The State, 49 Texas, 676; Tatum v. The State, 63 Ala., 152; The State v. Pratt, 34 Vt., 394. If the plaintiff, S. E. Jones, is a holder of the note in good faith for value, and received it in the usual course of business, he is unaffected by the fact that it was executed for an illegal consideration. 1 Dan. on Neg. Inst., sec. 197. When the act out of which the consideration arises has been expressly prohibited by statute under a penalty, the defense has been held to apply to an innocent holder of the note, as in the case of usury. Our Supreme Court has held that a note given for usurious interest is void even in the hands of an innocent holder. Andrews v. Hoxie, 5 Texas, 171. But in this case there is no direct prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors to an habitual drunkard, or to a person after notice as provided by law; nor is there any declaration that a note given in consideration of such sales shall be void. 1 Dan. on Neg. Inst., secs. 197, 198, 199. The cases cited by appellant treat the instrument as void only as between the parties. Monroe v. Smelly, 25 Texas, 586, was a suit on a note given for money won at a game called “ ten pins.” The note was given to Hale by Smelly and transferred to Monroe after maturity. Seeligson v. Lewis & Williams, 65 Texas, 215, grew out of a “ cotton futures ” contract, denounced by the decision as contrary to public policy and-void. The suit was upon promissory notes executed by the defendant, who employed plaintiffs as brokers in the transaction, for money advanced by them in paying margins, and plaintiffs’ commissions. It was held that as between the parties the notes were void for want of consideration. In Davis v. Sittig, 65 Texas, 497, it appeared that the note, though negotiable in form, was not transferred by endorsement, and was not in possession of the person to whom it was made payable; nor was it shown that the person to whom it was assigned before maturity ever paid value for it. So it was held that the plaintiff took the note subject to all defenses which the maker of it could urge against it. By a cross-assignment of error the appellee calls in question the action of the court in overruling his demurrer to the defendant’s answer, setting up the illegality of the consideration for which the note was executed. The purpose of the statute in requiring as a prerequisite to the license the execution of the bond with the condition prescribed, is clearly to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors to habitual drunkards, and to any person whose wife, mother, sister, or daughter shall forbid the sale in the manner prescribed by the statute. Sayles’ Ann. Stats., art. 3226a, sec. 4. A sale, then, in violation of the condition of the bond as prescribed by law is a sale in violation of law. Notwithstanding the fact that the law prescribes a penalty for the breach of the condition of the bond, yet, we think, the evident purpose of the statute being to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors to habitual drunkards and to persons after notice as prescribed, the consideration for such liquors would be illegal, because growing out of a transaction sought to be prohibited by law. Not only can the recovery of the penalty fixed by the statute be had, but the recovery of the consideration money by the seller may be defeated. The contract would be illegal and void as between the parties. Poll, on Con., 260; Wood’s Mast, and Serv., secs. 198-200; 1 Pars, on Con., 458. The case of Campbell v. Segars, decided by the Supreme Court of Alabama (1 Southern Reporter, 714), was a suit on a note given for fertilizers sold in violation of the inspection law of the State, which fixed a penalty for its violation. The demurrer to the answer setting up the defense, that the contract was in violation of law and void, was overruled. This is a much stronger case; for here the sale itself is sought to be prohibited, while in the Alabama case the inspection of the guano was the purpose of the law. There was no error in overruling plaintiff’s demurrer to the answer. For the error in the charge of the court defining “habitual drunkard,” the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 2, 1893.","James A. Campbell v. S. E. Jones. No. 203. 1. Void Note—Illegal Consideration.—A note given to a liquor dealer in payment for liquors sold by him to an habitual drunkard, or to an;7 person after having received notice from the wife, mother, sister, or daughter not to sell such person intoxicating liquors, is void for want of good consideration, in the hands of the original payee. 2. Habitual Drunkard — Definition. — It was error to define the term habitual drunkard, in a suit on such a note, as “ one whose mind had become so impaired by the use of intoxicating liquors or drugs, that he is incapable of taking care of himself or property.” This is the definition in the statute relating to guardianship, and is for the purpose of determining when a guardian of the person and estate shall be appointed, and does not apply to the meaning of the term when used in the statute providing for the execution of a bond by a liquor dealer. It is here used in its common acceptation, and the capacity of the person to take care of himself or property is not in issue. 3. Innocent Holder of Note.—If the plaintiff is holder of the note in good faith for value, and received in the usual course of business, he is unaffected by the fact that it was executed for an illegal consideration, unless the transaction is expressly denounced under penalty. 4. Illegal Consideration Against Bona Fide Holder. — When the act out of which the consideration arose has been expressly prohibited by statute under a penalty, the defense has been held to apply to an innocent holder of the note, as in case of usury; but in this case there is no distinct prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquors to an habitual drunkard, nor is there any declaration that a note given for such consideration shall be void, and it is therefore void only between the parties. 5. Liquor Dealer’s Bond—Penalties for Violation.—The purpose of' the statute in requiring a bond from a liquor dealer, with the conditions prescribed, was to prevent the sale of liquors to the prohibited classes of purchasers named. A sale, then, in violation of the conditions of the bond, is a sale in violation of law, and the consideration for such sales would be illegal because growing out of a transaction sought to be prohibited by law; and not only may recovery be had of the statutory penalty, but the recovery of the consideration money by the seller may be defeated. Appeal from Cherokee. Tried below before Hon. Frank B. Guinn.. McClure & Gibson, for appellant.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This suit was instituted in the District Court of Archer County, by F. E. Dycus as plaintiff, against L. W. Hart as defendant. Subsequently Mrs. E. A. Hart, wife of L. W. Hart, made herself a party defendant. The plaintiff sought to recover 369 acres of land out of the Michael Fanning survey, lying in Archer County. The plaintiff’s claim arose out of a conveyance executed by George Finnin and Mark Lavery, alleged to be heirs of Michael Fanning, in whose name or to whose heirs the original certificate and patent issued. It was proved that George Finnin and Mark Lavery were the heirs of Michael Finnin, and it was also contended by plaintiff, that Michael Fanning and Michael Finnin was the same person. This question of identity was submitted to the jury and was solved against the plaintiff. It appears from a bill of exceptions, that the defendant L. W. Hart, in March, 1886, purchased the land in controversy from George E. Finnin, a son of the George Finnin under whom appellant claimed by deed previ-' ously executed. By means of this conveyance from George E. Finnin to appellee Hart, the plaintiff sought to place defendants in the attitude of claimants under a common source of title. Defendants, evidently and naturally solicitous to sever themselves from this embarrassing connection, and preferring to occupy the position of naked trespassers, filed a plea disclaiming all title in the land through George Finnin, or George E. Finnin, and giving notice that they would not rely upon any interest of George Finnin, or George E. Finnin, or Mark Lavery,' or “any of the Finnin family.” This disclaimer was sustained by the court, and the plaintiff was forbidden to use the deed referred to for the purpose of showing that the parties deraign title from a common source. In this we think the court erred. In the case of Burns v. Goff, 79 Texas, 236, our Supreme Court holds, that a defendant “may not defeat the rule of common source by a declaration that he does not claim under it.” If, as a matter of fact, the defendants deraign their title from the heirs of Michael Finnin, they thereby admit the validity of that title, and they will not be permitted to defeat it by showing an outstanding title in the heirs of Michael Fanning with which they are not in any way connected. Glover v. Thomas, 75 Texas, 506. Plaintiff’s title is derived through a deed from one John L. Scott to plaintiff, executed in May, 1889. John L. Scott claimed under a deed to himself by the heirs of Michael Finnin, dated March 6, 1855. In 1871 John L. Scott conveyed the land in question to his brother Levi Scott, a resident of another State. The deed recited the condition that Levi, would remove to Texas and settle upon the land. Levi, unwilling to abide by this condition, returned the deed to his brother; whereupon the latter erased the words expressing the condition and again sent it to Levi, by whom-it was held until February, 1889, when he again returned it to John L. Scott. This deed was never recorded. It does not appear whether or not it was destroyed. At the time of the sale to plaintiff by John L. Scott, in May, 1889, the latter remitted to his brother Levi $100 of the $300 paid by Dycus in consideration for the land. Appellees contend, that even under the common source of title with which they are sought to be affected, there is an outstanding legal title in Levi Scott which will prevent a recovery by plaintiff. If, when Levi Scott returned the deed to his brother John L. Scott, in February, 1889,-it was the intention of the two that John L. Scott should be thereby reinvested with title to the land, we are of opinion that the former would be estopped from claiming the property. The existence of this estoppel, however, depends upon the existence of the intention specified; unless that intention existed, the surrender of a deed could not operate to divest the title out of Levi Scott and revest it in his brother. Dev. on Deeds, secs. 303-305; see, also, Lapowski v. Smith, 1 Texas Civ. App., 391. As we are not prepared to say that the evidence does not indicate this intention, we are unable to sustain this contention of appellees. John L. Scott speaks of this deed as a quitclaim. The record, however, elsewhere describes it as a conveyance to the land, in consideration of $350 paid. Though the word “ quitclaim” is actually used, if the deed nevertheless purported to convey the land itself, and not the mere right or title of the grantor John L. Scott, and if the plaintiff paid the purchase money without notice of any claim by Levi Scott, he would be protected as an innocent purchaser against the unregistered deed of the latter. Richardson v. Levi, 67 Texas, 360. Under such circumstances, it could not be claimed that there was an outstanding legal title precluding the plaintiff from recovery. The court did not err in refusing the special charge requested by appellant, and which, we think, was upon the weight of evidence. For the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 7, 1893.","F. E. Dycus v. L. W. Hart et al. No. 85. 1. Trespass to Try Title—Common Source—Disclaimer of, Unavailing.—Where in trespass to try title both parties in fact deraign title from a common source, the defendant thereby admits the validity of that title, and will not be permitted, upon filing a disclaimer of holding under it, to defeat it by showing an outstanding title with which he is not in anyway connected. 2. Title by Estoppel — Surrender of Unrecorded Deed Revests Title, When. — Where the grantee in an unrecorded deed returns it to the grantor, if it was the intention of the two that the grantor should thereby be reinvested with title to the land, such grantee will be estopped to claim the property; but this estoppel depends on such intention, without which the surrender of the deed does not operate to divest and revest the title. 3. Registration—Innocent Purchaser Protected.—One who pays the , purchase money for land without notice of a prior unrecorded deed thereof, or of any claim under it, will be protected as an innocent purchaser against such unregistered conveyance. Appeal from Archer. Tried below before Hon. P. M. Stine. J. R. Robinson, A. H. Carrigan, and F. E. Dycus, for appellant. 1. Defendant can not defeat the rule of common source by a declaration that, he does not claim under it, and plaintiff is entitled to prove such common source; and when he has shown the superior title thereunder is entitled to recover, unless the defendant prove a superior right in himself. Burns v. Goff, 79 Texas, 236; Garner v. Lasker, 71 Texas, 433; Calder v. Ramsey, 66 Texas, 218; Sellman v. Hardin, 58 Texas, 86; Koenigheim v. Miles, 67 Texas, 113. 2. There is no pretense that Dycus, the plaintiff, had any notice of Scott having given or attempting to give the land to his brother. Evidently the parties intended to treat the surrender of the deed as a reconveyance, and Levi Scott would be estopped from setting up title to the land. Mussey v. Holt, 24 N. H., 248; Faelks v. Burns, 16 N. J. Eq., 250; Commonwealth v. Dudley, 10 Mass., 403. 3. If it were shown that plaintiff had notice of this former conveyance when he bought, it would hardly defeat him in this action. But no notice is brought home to him. Johnson v. Newman, 43 Texas, 628; Barnes v. Jamison, 24 Texas, 362. Robert Kerr, and Hunter, Stewart & Dunklin, for appellees. 1. Where a common source of title is shown, the defendant may defeat the plaintiff’s claim by showing a superior title in himself, or by showing an outstanding superior title in a third party. Keys v. Mason, 44 Texas, 143. An outstanding title is a good defense, although defendant may not claim under such title. Styles v. Gray, 10 Texas, 503; Kinney v. Vinson, 32 Texas, 125. 2. The reason of the rule that the defense of outstanding title is valid in the action of trespass to try title is, that the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title, and not the infirmity of his adversary’s.. Burleson v. Burleson, 28 Texas, 383. 3. Whether the existence of such outstanding title be disclosed by the-evidence of the plaintiff or defendant, it will defeat a recovery by the plaintiff. Kinney v. Vinson, 32 Texas, 125. 4. In trespass to try title the defendant may under a plea of not guilty show a superior outstanding title in a third party to bar a recovery on the part of plaintiff. Adams & Wicks v. House, 61 Texas, 639; Tapp v. Corey, 64 Texas, 594."
"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This was an action of trespass to try title, brought by appellee, December 28, 1889, in the ordinary form, for tlxe recovery of 109 acres of land in the possession of appellants, who were made defendants, and for damages. The appellants pleaded not guilty, and upon the trial there was a verdict and judgment for appellee for the land and $162.50 damages, from which this appeal is prosecuted. Appellee introduced in evidence the following deed from himself to appellants: “ The State of Texas, Harrison County. — Know all men by these presents, that I, L. P. Alford, joined herein by his children, J. P. Alford, W. L. Alford, and II. C. Alford, for and in consideration of an agreement by E. L. Alford and wife Mollie Alford, during their life, and at their death to their heirs, this day executed and delivered to me, to care for and support me during my natural life and furnish me with the necessaries and comforts suitable to my age and physical condition, and with clothes to wear, the receipt of which said agreement is hereby acknowledged, have this day bargained and sold, and by these presents do hereby bargain, sell, release, and convey unto the said E. L. Alford and wife Mollie Alford, during their natural life, and at their death their heirs, the following described property: -*• -*• $ -x- “ To have and to hold the same, together with all and singular the rights, members, hereditaments, and appurtenances thereto belonging, unto them, the said E. L. Alford and Mollie Alford, their heirs and assigns forever: upon condition, that they shall faithfully comply with all and each of the stipulations in their said agreement to me, and before mentioned as the consideration of this instrument; that if said agreement is not so complied with, then this conveyance shall be void and of no force and effect; and a vendor’s lien is hereby expressly reserved on said land by L. P. Alford to secure the faithful performance of said agreement executed by E. L. Alford and wife, during their natural life, and at their death to their heirs, as the consideration hereof; and the right to live on and use said land during the term of his natural life is hereby expressly reserved. And at the death of him, the said L. P. Alford, if all of the provisions of said agreement have been complied with, said premises by this conveyance shall become their absolute property in fee simple. “This November 2, 1888.” Appellee then proved that at the time of the execution of this instrument there was a verbal undertaking on the part of appellants to do the things for which the deed stipulated as its consideration, and introduced evidence for the purpose of showing that they had failed to perform their part of the contract. It was shown that appellants moved into the house on the premises mentioned in the deed, and lived there with appellee for about six months, when appellee left, appellants remaining in possession. Appellee testified: that he occupied his old room in the house, using his own furniture; that he ate at the same table with appellants; that the food and cooking were bad; that the coffee was not good and had grounds in it; that no clothes were given him, and that he had to pay for his own washing; that his bed was not properly cared for, and many vermin were allowed to get on it — so many that he could not use it for a month after he left; that on three or four occasions, the details of which he fully gave, appellant E. L. Alford, who was his son, cursed and abused him. Appellee was 78 years of age, and his wife had died only a few days before the agreement was made between him and appellants. He complained to his daughter-in-law of the way in which his son was treating him, and she replied she could not help it. The testimony of appellants denied these facts testified to by appellee, and there was other evidence offered on each side, making a conflict on the material points. It was shown that appellants offered to pay to ap-pellee $100 per year for 1889 and 1890, but the time when this was done does not appear. Appellants offered to prove that they had made valuable and permanent improvements on the land; which was objected to by appellee, on the ground that no improvements had been pleaded; and the court sustained the objection. Appellants reserved exception. It was shown that the land had been common property of appellee and his deceased wife and was their homestead, and that she left children surviving her, among whom was appellant E. L. Alford. The motion for a new trial, assignment of errors, and briefs, present the points discussed in the opinion. Under their first assignment of error appellants contend that appellee did not show such title as is sufficient to enable him to recover in an action of trespass to try title. Their position seems to be, that by the deed title to the land vested in them, and that it could not be recovered in such a suit, but that the remedj' upon a breach of the contract was a suit to rescind or cancel the deed. There is some difficulty in determining the exact legal effect of that instrument. In consideration of the agreement of appellants to care for and support appellee during his natural life, and furnish Mm with the necessaries and comforts suitable to his age and physical condition, and with clothes to wear, it conveys, by its premises, the land to appellants during their natural lives and at their death to their heirs. It then provides, that they shall hold the property to themselves, their heirs, and assigns forever, upon condition that they shall comply with their agreement. The deed then proceeds to reserve a vendor’s lien to secure the performance of appellants’ contract, with the right of appellee to live on and use the land during his natural life, and to provide that if at his death the contract shall have been performed by appellants the land shall become their property in absolute fee simple. All of these provisions show that an estate upon condition was intended to be created; some of them indicating that the title was never to pass until there was a performance of the condition, and others that the estate was to take eifect at once, but subject to forfeiture by failure to perform the agreement. It is not very material to the present inquiry to which class of conditions the one in question belongs. Whether it was precedent or subsequent, the failure of appellants to perform it defeated their right to the property. Looking to the purpose of the conveyance, we think the intention was to vest in the grantees the present possession and enjoyment of the land, subject to the reserved right of the grantor to live on it also, and have such use of it as was consistent with the right conferred on the grantees, and was proper to enable them to care for, support, and maintain Mm there, as agreed upon; but that the title was never to pass unless at the death of the grantor the agreement had been fully performed. This imposed upon appellants, at all times, the burden of doing the things required by the contract, and a failure at any time to do so worked a forfeiture of any right they may have acquired under the deed. This would be the case also if the title vested subject to the condition to be thereafter fulfilled. Tied, on Real Prop., sec. 277. It follows from this, that in either view of the instrument, if appellants had broken their contract before the suit was brought, the title which appellee conveyed to them was determined, and Ms right to recover the property became perfect. This virtually disposes of the second point made by appellants, that all the makers of the deed were necessary parties to the suit. All that was required of appellee was to show title to the property as against appellants. He had the title when he made the deed, for one-half of the land belonged to him absolutely, and he had the right to occupy all"" of'it dur-o ing his lifetime as his homestead. If, therefore, appellants’ rights under the deed were at an end, Ms title was complete. For this reason' also it was not necessary for Mm to demand possession or give notice to appellants before he brought suit. Tied, on Real. Prop., sec. 277. There was no error in excluding evidence of improvements, because none were pleaded. This brings us to a consideration of the sufficiency of the evidence to show a breach of the contract on the part of the appellants. On several points it is quite indefinite. In what respects and to what extent the food and drink were bad is not explained, nor whether or not the neglect of appellee was common or habitual. While there is evidence that no clothing was furnished him, and that he had to pay for his own washing, it is not shown that he needed more clothing than he had, nor that he ever asked that appellants either furnish it to him or pay his laundry bills-His evidence, however, does, if taken as true, show that he was subjected to indignities by his son, which may have rendered it unbearable for him, with proper self-respect, to continue to live with appellants. The contract contemplated that they should all live together at his old home, and that he should there receive the care and support for which he provided. Delivered November 17, 1892. Mistreatment of him by appellants, of such a character as to render his life there intolerable, would be as much a breach of their agreement as a failure to furnish him the necessaries of life. This evidence, together with the testimony as to the personal discomforts he was allowed to suffer while living with appellants, was sufficient to support the finding of the jury. The question was submitted to the jury by a charge which was fair to both sides, and we can not, consistently with settled rules, disturb their verdict. Affirmed.","E. L. Alford and Wife v. L. P. Alford. No. 25. 1. Conditional Deed — Case in Judgment. — Appellee, joined by all his children save L. P. Alford, conveyed to appellants the land sued for, by a deed, the consideration for which, as therein expressed, was the agreement of appellants to care for and support appellee during his natural life, and furnish him with the necessaries and comforts suitable to his age and physical condition, and with clothes to wear; to have and to hold the land forever, upon condition that appellants should faithfully comply with all the stipulations in said agreement, and if said agreement was not complied with the conveyance to be void. A vendor's lien was reserved by appellee on the land to secure the faithful performance of the agreement, and right to live on and use the land during his natural life was also reserved, and at the death of the appellee, if all the provisions of said agreement had been complied with, the land was to become the absolute property of the appellants in fee simple There was evidence showing, breach of the agreement, which was controverted by the appellants. The suit was in the ordinary form of trespass to try title. Held, as to the form of action, there is some difficulty in determining the exact legal effect of the instrument. Its provisions show that an estate upon condition was intended to be created. Some of them indicate that title was not to pass until performance, and others that the estate was to take effect at once. But whether the conditions were precedent or subsequent, if appellants broke their contract before suit was brought the title determined, and right of appellee to recover the property became perfect. 2. Construction of Deed. — Looking to the purpose of the conveyance, present possession and enjoyment of the land was vested in the grantees, subject to the reserved right of the grantor to live on it also, and to have such use of it as was consistent with the rights conferred on the grantees; but the title was never to pass unless at the death of the grantor the agreement had been fully performed. 3. Parties to Suit. — All the makers of the deed were not necessary parties. Appellee had only to show title as against appellants. When the deed was made he had title to half the land and the right to occupy all of it during his life as his homestead. If appellants"" rights under the deed were at an end. appellee's title was complete, and it was not necessary for him to demand possession or give notice to appellants before he brought suit. 4. Improvements. — There being no pleading setting up improvements made in good faith, evidence thereof was properly excluded. 5. Breach of Conditions. — The evidence of the appellee is in several respects indefinite, but if taken as true showed that he was subject to indignities by his son which may have rendered life with him unbearable. The contract contemplated that they should all live together at his own home, and that he should there receive the care and support for which he provided, and mistreatment of him by appellants of such a character as to render life there intolerable would be as much a breach of the agreement as failure to furnish him the necessaries of life.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This was a suit by appellants, as devisees and heirs of devisees under the will of Obedience Smith, against a number of defendants, to recover a tract of land which had belonged to their testatrix and had passed to plaintiffs under her will, subject to the powers therein conferred upon her executor to sell it. All of the defendants except appellee Orange Swan either defaulted or recovered judgment under the statute of limitations. Swan had no title by limitation, and judgment was rendered for him upon the strength of his title otherwise shown, and this is the occasion of the present appeal, in which the only questions presented relate to the correctness of that part of the judgment. The titles exhibited by the parties were as follows: Obedience Smith died in 1847, leaving a will, which was duly probated the same year in Harris County. Hiram G-. Runnels was by the will made its executor, and duly qualified as such. The administration by him as executor was opened up in the County Court, and was never formally closed, some occasional orders being made, the last of which was in June, 1851. The will contained the provision that the executor might cause certain lands in litigation, and such other as he might think proper, to be divided into town lots, and sell them for cash or credit, as he might elect; and further provided, that all the residue of the property of the testatrix should go to her children and grandchildren. It is conceded that the property in controversy was embraced within the terms of the power given to the executor. On April 21, 1848, the said Hiram G-. Runnels caused the land of Obedience Smith to be divided into town lots, of which the property sued for was designated as lot 37, and subsequently the said lot 37 was subdivided by plat or map, recorded in Harris County records of deeds, into smaller blocks and lots. On the 16th of March, 1855, B. F. Tankersley, in the name of Hiram G. Runnels, executed and delivered to A. N. Smith a deed having the formal requisites of a deed of conveyance, which was duly acknowledged before W. R. Baker, clerk of the County Court of Harris County, on May 8, 1855, and was duly recorded on the same dajq purporting to convey from Hiram G. Runnels to A. M. Smith the lot 37 sued for by the plaintiffs, said deed reciting that it was executed for Hiram G. Runnels “by B. F. Tankersley, agent and attorney in fact;” also reciting a consideration paid of $105; and further reciting that the conveyance was made “by authority of the last will and testament of Obedience Smith, deceased.” No power of attorney appears of record, and search and inquiry were unsuccessful in discovering one—B. F. Tankersley, A. N. Smith, W. R. Baker, and Hiram G. Runnels having all died before the commencement of this suit; the said Hiram G. Runnels having died about the year 1860, and the said W. R. Baker shortly before the commencement of this suit. On March 17, 1855, A. N. Smith made a deed for the same property to W. B. Baker and B. F. Tankersley, reciting a paid consideration of $155, which deed was recorded May 8, 1855. Tankersley died January 1, 1859. His heirs, on October 15, 1877, made a deed to W. B. Baker for the undivided half of the lot 37, reciting a consideration of $1000. This deed was recorded at the date of its execution. It was further shown, that by the subdivision made by Eunnels of the lot 37, that lot was divided into twelve blocks of six lots and two fractional lots each, and that there had been from and under Baker to the time of trial about 186 transfers of various dates, all reciting valuable considerations, and duly spread upon the county records, for different parts of the lot claimed under the deed from Tankersley; that all of the defendants, except those who did not answer, claimed under Baker by regular chains of transfer for their respective tracts, duly registered. The defendant Swan connected himself with Baker by regular transfers, the first of which, conveying title out of Baker, was of date December 29, 1886. Swan only claims an interest of two-thirds in three lots of the subdivision. It was shown, that about the year 1870 possession of lot 37 was taken for and under Baker, claiming through the Tankersley deed; that the property was parcelle' out and sold to various persons, a lot or so to each, the purchasers building homes upon it and buying on installments; that nearly all of the lot 37 was thus peopled, and the defendants were all in possession, and are conceded to have title by limitation, except Swan, who has never had possession. Since Baker acquired the land he and those claiming under him have paid the taxes and exercised ownership in all the usual modes, and none of the devisees under the will of Obedience Smith have, until this suit was commenced, objected or in any way asserted claim to the land or paid any taxes upon it. Eunnels, Tankersley, and Baker were' intimate and were related to the devisees of Obedience Smith. Tankersley was a prominent lawyer in Houston and the legal adviser of Eunnels. In 1860 there was a suit for partition, to which all the devisees of Obedience Smith and W. E. Baker were parties, in which all the unsold portion of the lands of the testatrix were divided, not including that in controversy. The decree contained the following clause: “ By consent of parties it is agreed, that this decree shall not affect the rights of any of the parties hereto to any lands belonging to the estate of Obedience Smith which may have been illegally sold by the executor or any one purporting to act for him.” Upon this state of facts the question arises, did the deed from Tankersley, assuming to act as attorney in fact for the executor, pass to Smith title to the land ? Appellants contend, that inasmuch as the will did not exempt the executor from the control of the Probate Court, no sale made by him under the power conferred by the will was valid without confirmation by that court. Both the Act of 1846, under which the will took effect, and the Act of 1848, in force when Tankersley executed the deed, authorized the exercise by executors of powers of sale conferred by wills. Hart. Dig., art. 1101; Pasch. Dig., art. 1324. The provisions of the statutes requiring confirmation of sales apply to such sales only as must be authorized by the court. Hart. Dig., art. 1099; Pasch. Dig., art. 1327. Valid powers of sale given to executors by will are not revoked by the probate of the will, but may be exercised, though the administration of the estate is not by other provisions of the will taken out of the Probate Court. The court below, therefore, correctly held, that the will clothed Runnels with the power to sell and convey the land without the sanction of the court. The next contention of appellants is, that the deed from Tankersley to Smith, assuming the existence of a power of attorney from Runnels .to Tankersley, is void, because Runnels could not delegate the power of sale conferred upon him by the will. It is undoubtedly true that a discretionary power of sale, such as that given to Runnels by this will, can not be delegated by the donee or trustee to another. The negotiation of such a sale, and the arrangement of and agreement to all its details, must be done by the trustee himself. Acts which are merely mechanical or ministerial may be committed by the trustee to another; and this includes the mere act of executing and delivering the deed of conveyance where everything else is done by the trustee. Where the trustee himself agrees upon and arranges the sale and settles all preliminaries involving the exercise of discretion, he may by agent perform the act of executing and delivering the deed. 1 Dev. on Deeds, 422, note 3; Hawley v. James, 5 Paige, 318. Except in case of a deed thus executed, a conveyance by one claiming to act as attorney in fact of the donee or trustee of such a power as this, where the sale was neither made nor ratified by the trustee, would be void. And in the case above supposed, the production of the deed executed by the attorney in fact would not be sufficient evidence of title in the purchaser, but he would be required to produce evidence of the circumstances under which it was made to authorize and sustain it. In the present case there was no direct proof of the existence of such circumstances; and the deed of Tankersley must be held insufficient to convey the title, unless such proof is supplied by presumption arising from lapse of time, possession held, ownership claimed and exercised under the deed, and from acquiescence of those adversely interested. Had Runnels been the owner of the land, there can be no doubt that the former existence and authenticity of the power recited in Tankersley’s deed would be presumed upon facts much less cogent than those which this evidence discloses. Harrison v. McMurray, 71 Texas, 122; O’Donnell v. Johns, 76 Texas, 362. We think the further proposition may be asserted, that had no such deed as this been produced and the proof had shown such facts as these,, coupled with a claim of ownership by Baker and his privies under a deed direct from Runnels, presumption of the execution of such a deed would be warranted. 2 Whart. on Ev., sec. 1353. Why, then, should not such a presumption be indulged of the existence of a power of attorney from Runnels to Tankersley, such as the law would authorize, empowering the latter to do the act of formally consummating a sale which the former had made ? All the facts which were necessary to uphold the deed might exist in paroi except the instrument conferring such a power, and the evidence of them therefore be more easily lost. If a writing may be presumed, why may not facts which would uphold it be supplied in the same manner ? It may be conceded that a court would not presume the existence of an unlawful power. But if the proof warrants the presumption of a power and an adequate legal one might have existed, such a power, rather than an illegal one, should be presumed. It is objected by appellants, that there is no evidence that they have known of or acquiesced in the claim of Baker and others claiming under the Tankersley conveyance. The facts in the case admit of no other inference but that they did. For more than a third of a century they have not in any way asserted a claim to the property, which was theirs but for this conveyance, and which all this time has been openly claimed, used, and enjoyed by the claimants under such conveyance. They must be held to have known of such claim and to have acquiesced in it, because otherwise it is to be presumed that they would have raised some objection. The fact that Swan has not been in possession of the small portion of the property claimed by him can not alter the case. The whole was claimed and possessed by Baker sufficiently to support the presumption. The court decided correctly in presuming the existence of a valid power in Tankersley to execute the deed, and in rendering judgment for defendant. Its judgment is therefore affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 30, 1893. Appellants having filed a motion requesting this court to file conclusions of law and fact upon which the judgment was based, the court regarding the foregoing as a sufficient compliance with the law, adopted same as its conclusions, both upon the facts and the law applicable thereto. Application to the Supreme Court for a writ of error was refused May 18, 1893.","Terry Smith et al. v. Orange Swan et al. No. 121. 1. Wills—Execution of Powers.—R. was named as executor of the will of S., who died in 1817. The will gave R. power to sell certain realty, but did not exempt the executor from'the control of the Probate Court. Both the act of 184G and 1848 authorized the exercise by executors of powers of sale conferred by wills; confirmation was only necessary of such sales as had to be authorized by the court. Valid powers of sale given to executors by will are not revoked by the probate of the will, but may be exercised though the administration of the estate is not by other provisions of the will taken out of the Probate Court. R. therefore had power to sell and convey the land without the sanction of the court. 2. Powers that Can Not be Delegated.—The land was sold in 1855 by T., who assumed to act as attorney in fact of R., though no power of attorney was shown. A discretionary power of sale such as was given R. by this will can not be delegated by the donee or trustee to another. Negotiations and arrangements for a sale in all its details having been made by the trustee himself, he may commit the execution of acts which are merely mechanical to another, and this includes the mere act of executing and delivering a deed of conveyance when everything else is done by the trustee. 3. Same—Supporting Evidence.—A conveyance by one claiming to act as attorney in fact of the donee or trustee of such a power as this, where the sale was neither made nor ratified by the trustee, would be void; and in the ease above supposed the production of the deed executed by the attorney in fact would not be sufficient evidence of title, but evidence would be required of the circumstances under which it was made, to authorize and sustain it. 4. Presumptions—Lapse of Time—Acquiescence.—In this case there was no direct proof of such circumstances, and T.’s deed was insufficient to convey title unless supplied by presumption. For a third of a century the land has been openly possessed, used, and enjoyed by claimants under T.’s deed, and appellants have not in any way asserted a claim to the property, which was theirs but for this conveyance. They must be held to have known of such claim, and to have acquiesced in it. The court below correctly presumed the existence of a valid power in T. Appeal from Harris. Tried below before Hon. James Masterson. O. T. Holt and J. M. Coleman, for appellants. 1. When an agent makes a deed to land without authority to do so, the ratification of the principal must be by deed; a mere assent or acquiescence is not enough. Acquiescence by paroi to bind the principal must be by such acts as will operate as an estoppel in pais. Zimpelman v. Keating, 72 Texas, 318; 27 Texas, 123, 124. 2. Hiram G-. Runnels, as to the power of sale vested in him by the will of Obedience Smith, was not the donee of a trust distinct from his statutory functions as executor, but he remains subject to the jurisdiction and control of the Probate Court. It was necessary that the Probate Court should approve and confirm sales made by Runnels as executor; and without that the sale was incomplete, and the title did not pass. Hart. Dig., arts. 1099, 1846; Pasch. Dig., arts. 1327, 1848; Sayles’ Civ. Stats., arts. 2090, 2091a. 3. The doctrine, that one whose land has been conveyed by the unauthorized act of an agent, and who might by reasonable diligence have known of the sale and claim and possession under it, will be presumed from his silence after a long period of years to have ratified the sale, has no application in an action of trespass to try title, where the owner relies upon a legal and not upon an equitable title. Moss v. Berry, 53 Texas, 632; 49 Texas, 602. 4. Runnels being the executor of an estate, occupying a position of personal trust and confidence, as such could not delegate his authority to sell and convey land by agent unless it was expressly so provided in the will; and notwithstanding the lapse of time, no presumption will be indulged that a void or illegal power of attorney existed.

Runnels was, as to the power of sale vested in him by the will of Obedience Smith, the donee of a trust power, distinct from his common law or statutory functions as executor.

The conduct of the appellants in long acquiescing in the opposing claim, in failing to assert or perform any act of ownership while valuable rights in many persons were springing up on the faith of their inertness, in waiting until the last living witness of the transaction, itself a third of a century old, had died, made it the duty of the court to apply every reasonable presumption against them, and well warranted the presumption that was indulged. 2 Whart. Ev., sec. 1338."
"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This appeal is from a verdict and judgment depriving appellant of a section of land situated in Denton County, patented to the heirs of William Wallace. The verdict is sustained by the evidence in establishing the conclusion, that the title to the land in controversy had been vested in appellees (about which there is no dispute here), and that they were entitled to recover, unless the adverse possession of appellant under a tax deed, which was excluded from the evidence, had the effect of defeating that title. If this deed was not admissible for any of the purposes for which it was offered, the judgment must be affirmed, otherwise it must be reversed. The following is a plat of the survey as described in the patent and in that part of the tax collector’s deed which immediately follows the conveying clause, though in the first part of the deed, where the levy under the tax roll is recited, instead of calling for a north course from the southwest corner, the call, evidently by mistake, is to run west 552 varas instead of north: The deed was excluded on the ground that such an element of uncertainty in the description of the land was introduced by the expression, after setting out the field notes, “ less 60 acres out of the southwest corner of same,” as to render the deed void. Appellant offered to prove in connection with the deed, that the extreme southwest and northwest corners of this survey could be found distinctly marked upon the ground as it had been originally run and established, and that the distance between these marked and well defined points was in reality 587 varas, instead of 552 varas, as called for in the field notes. The contention of appellant is, that the 60 acres should be taken in a rectangular form out of the southwest corner of the survey, and hence that the deed on its face was sufficiently certain as a predicate for his five years adverse possession. This construction of the deed seems to us the natural and reasonable one. Several cases hold that a deed which conveys a definite quantity of land to be taken out of a specified corner will be sustained when it can be taken in a square. Smith v. Nelson (Mo.), 19 S. W. Rep., 734; Doe v. Clayton (Ala.), 2 So. Rep., 31; Green v. Jordan (Ala.), 3 Am. State Rep., 711. It seems to us, that the principle upon which these cases rest requires that the 60 acres, which can not on the face of the deed in question be taken in a square, should be taken in that other form of rectangle, to-wit, an oblong, with the west boundary as a base line. The contour of the survey indicates this as the obvious intention of the grantor in the deed. It would seem also, if this construction be incorrect, that as the uncertainty would relate only to the west limb of the survey, and not to its main trunk, the deed would be admissible in support of the adverse possession of the latter part of the survey. Such a principle of construction seems to have been applied by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin to the description of a tract of land lying upon the east and west sides of a creek, the uncertainty of the description relating solely to the portion on the west side of the creek. Scheiber v. Koehler, 49 Wis., 291. The rule adopted in this State in passing upon the sufficiency of a tax deed to support the defense of five years limitation seems to be, that the description is sufficient if, unaided by extrinsic facts, it satisfies the mind that the land adversely occupied is embraced within the description contained in the deed. If so, the owner is notified that his possession has been invaded. Brokel v. McKechnie, 69 Texas, 32; McDonald v. Hamblin, 78 Texas, 628; Harber v. Dyches, 14 S. W. Rep., 580. It seems to us, from the description contained in this deed, without the aid of extrinsic evidence, that the land which it purports to convey can be found and identified with reasonable certainty; hence the second contention, that the oral testimony offered rendered the deed admissible, need not be considered. Overand v. Menczer, 83 Texas, 122. This conclusion leads to a reversal of the judgment. The cause will be remanded for a new trial on the issues of limitation and valuable improvements', which were not submitted to the jury on the former trial; but the issues submitted and passed upon will not be reopened. McConnell v. Wall, 67 Texas, 352; 65 Texas, 397. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 30, 1893. A motion for rehearing was refused, and the judgment modified by omitting the restriction of the issues to be tried, as provided in the opinion.","E. S. Day v. R. H. Needham et al. No. 127. 1. Tax Deed—Description of Land.—A description of land in a tax deed is sufficient to support the defense of five years limitation thereunder if, unaided by extrinsic facts, it satisfies the mind that the land adversely occupied is embraced within the description contained in the deed. 2. Same — Deed of Tract “ Less Sixty Acres out of Southwest Corner.”—Where a patented section of land lies with its main body in a rectangular form, and with a projecting arm at its southwest corner, also in rectangular form, a tax deed which describes the entire survey by the calls in the patent, “ less 60 acres out of the southwest corner of same,” is sufficiently certain as a predicate for the five years adverse possession under the statute: since the excepted 60 acres, which can not on the face of the deed be taken in a square, may properly be taken out of the projecting arm in the form of an oblong rectangle, and any uncertainty as to the proper form therefor will not affect the main body of the survey. Appeal from Denton. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Smith & Bell, and Davis & Harris, for appellant. 1. The court erred in excluding from the evidence the defendant’s tax deed conveying to him all the lands described and mentioned in plaintiffs’ petition herein, except 60 acres out of the southwest corner of the same, when offered in evidence by defendant under his plea of the five years statute of limitation; because said deed upon its face showed a sufficient certainty of the description of the land thereby conveyed and mentioned therein to authorize its admission in evidence under the defendant’s said plea.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellee, claiming to be a corporation, sued appellants on the 13th day of August, 1891, in trespass to try title, to recover the possession of a house and lot in the town of Beaumont, and also to recover $280 rents for its use. Plaintiff based its demand for rents upon an alleged contract by which appellants, on the 12th day of May, 1883, rented the property at the rate of $10 per month, alleging that the lease had expired, and that appellants were wrongfully withholding the premises. A writ of sequestration was sued out and served, and defendants replevied. Appellants filed a number of exceptions to the petition, and answered by general denial, plea under oath denying the incorporation of plaintiff, and a plea of the statute of limitations. Plaintiff filed supplemental petition, alleging that defendants had acknowledged tenancy under it, and were estopped from denying its title; that defendants had, in writing signed by them, acknowledged the debt due under the contract for rents, on the 21st day of July, 1891; setting out more fully the terms of the rental contract, and showing that the defendants’ right to the possession under it ceased on the 31st day of July, 1891, and that the use of the property thereafter was worth $25 per month; that defendants had wrongfully withheld the possession and had replevied the property. Judgment was prayed for rents at the rate of $10 per month until the 1st of August, 1891, and thereafter at the rate of $25 per month against defendants, and also against the sureties on the replevy bond for rents accruing after it was given until the trial. Defendants excepted also to this pleading, denied its allegations, and pleaded that if they had acknowledged tenancy to plaintiff, they had been induced to do so by the fraudulent and false representations of plaintiff that it was the owner of the property, when in fact it was not. An exception filed by plaintiff to this last plea was sustained. All of the defendants’ exceptions to the plaintiff’s pleadings were overruled. When the case was called for trial, defendants made application for continuance for the testimony of a witness residing in McLennan County, Texas, stating that they were surprised by new matters alleged in the supplemental petition (which was filed on the day of trial) requiring additional evidence to meet them; that the testimony of the witness was material to the defense; that they had a meritorious defense, which could be shown by her; and that they had taken no steps to procure her evidence, because it was not expected she would be needed. The applicacation was overruled, and a trial was had, resulting in judgment in favor of plaintiff for the property sued for, and for the sum of $324.26 against defendants, and against the sureties on the replevy bond for $91.26 of the first amount. From this judgment defendants appealed, without moving for a new trial in the court below. The first and second assignments of error, that the petition showed no cause of action, and that the District Court had not jurisdiction of the case stated, are not well taken. An action of trespass to try title can be maintained to recover the possession and rents of real property, from a. tenant holding over after the expiration of his term. Thurber & Co. v. Conners, 57 Texas, 96. Had the original petition stood alone, some of the exceptions taken to it and presented in the third assignment, might have been good; especially that which points out its failure to show when the rental contract was by its terms to expire. The allegations necessary to meet the exceptions were, however, made in the supplemental petition. They should have been supplied by amendment of the original petition. No exception was taken based on this irregularity, and any objection which might have been made to this disregard of the rules may be treated as waived. Taking the original and supplemental petitions together, they meet the exceptions. ' The point made in the fourth assignment, which asserts that a sequestration can not issue against a tenant holding over, is involved in the ruling on the first and second assignments. A sequestration may issue in any case where a party sues for the title or possession of real property. Eev. Stats., art. 4489. The fifth assignment complains of the ruling sustaining exceptions to defendants’ plea setting up false representations by plaintiff as to title. There was no error in the ruling. It was not alleged that defendants had been deprived of the enjoyment of the property by any adverse claimant, and the question of title was wholly immaterial. The sixth assignment calls in question the regularity of the proceedings by which appellee claims to have been incorporated. By entering into the rental contract, and contracting an indebtedness with appellee as such, appellants estopped themselves to deny that appellee was a corporation in this suit for recovery of such possession and rents. Rev. Stats,, art. 599. In their seventh assignment of error appellants claim that the court rendered judgment for a greater sum than was warranted by the pleadings and by evidence. As to the first point, the supplemental petition claimed all that was awarded by the judgment. The second point might be disposed of by saying that it was not presented by motion for new trial in the court below. We have, however, examined the evidence and find that it amply supports the judgment. Indeed, there was no controversy in the trial about the indebtedness of defendants. The eighth assignment complains of a ruling which is not shown by the record. The findings of fact and of law are not before us. The motion for continuance was plainly insufficient. It pointed out no part of the pleadings which surprised defendants. The only fact stated in the supplemental petition which could not have been anticipated from the pleadings as they before stood, was the alleged acknowledgment of the debt, set up in reply to the plea of the statute of limitations. That was not especially pointed out by the application, and the court could not see from the application what allegation defendants regarded as introducing new matter. Besides, the acknowledgment became immaterial. If we reject all rents which would be barred without it, the evidence still shows an indebtedness quite as large as was found by the judgment. The sum due appellee was admitted by appellants upon the express condition that it be deducted from the rents barred by limitation. As appellants had not pleaded any setoff nor offered evidence of any, they were in no attitude to exact its allowance as a matter of right, and can not have it deducted from the part of the debt unbarred. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 16, 1893.","Lamb & Wynne v. Beaumont Temperance Hall Company. No. 77. 1. Action Against a Tenant Holding Over—An action of trespass to try title can be maintained to recover possession and rents of real property from a tenant holding over after the expiration of his term; and a sequestration may issue in any case where a party sues for title or possession of real property. 2. Tenant Holding Over can not Dispute his Landlord’s Title. There was no error in sustaining exceptions to defendants’ plea setting up false representations by plaintiff as to title. It is not alleged that defendants had been deprived of the enjoyment of the property by any adverse claimant, and the question of title was wholly immaterial. 3. Tenant Estopped to Question Regularity of Incorporation of Landlord.—By entering into the rental contract and contracting an indebtedness with appellee” as such, appellants estopped themselves to deny that appelleewas a corporation in this suit for recovery of possession and rents. 4. Continuance on Ground of Surprise.—Continuance was asked to procure the testimony of a witness living in another county, on the ground of surprise. The supplemental petition filed, which was the alleged ground of surprise, stated no new fact except alleged acknowledgment of the debt, which was set up in reply to the statute of limitations. If all barred rents are rejected, the-evidence shows an indebtedness quite as large as was found by the judgment. The motion was correctly overruled. Appeal from Jefferson. Tried below before Hon. W. H. Ford. Tom J. Russell, for appellants. Greer & Greer, for appellee."
"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellant owned 8 acres of land in the southern part of the city of Tyler, 377-¡- feet in length north and south, and on May 5, 1871, he conveyed to John H. Rowland 1 acre in the southwest corner of said 8 acres, 281 feet east and west by 157 feet north and south, of which appellee Swann is now the owner by mesne conveyance from Rowland, having bought from Yarbrough and Wimberley, March 3, 1873. On May 5, 1871, appellant conveyed to W. D. Burress 1 acre in the northwest corner of the 8 acres, 281 feet east and west by 157 feet north and south, of which the appellees 11. J. House and Edwina Duncan are now the owners by inheritance from their mother, Louisa L. House, who purchased from Burress on October 28, 1875. The width of the strip of land left by these deeds, between House on the north and Swann on the south, is 63] feet, which has never been conveyed by appellant to any one; east of and adjoining the two lots of 1 acre each, conveyed by appellant to Rowland and Burress respectively, there is a strip of land 59 feet east and west and extending 377] feet north and south through the block, which has never been sold by appellant to any one. Appellee Swann has enclosed an area 308 feet east and west by 176] feet north and south, which includes the 1 acre to which he has title, and extends 19] feet north on the 63] feet strip and extends 27 feet east on the 59 feet strip. Appellees House and Duncan have possession of an area 308 feet east and west by 169] feet north and south, extending south 12 feet on the 63] feet strip and east 27 feet on the 59 feet strip, which is enclosed by fence. This suit is an action of trespass to try title, brought by appellant January 23, 1890, to recover the strip of land thus held by appellees. The latter pleaded title by limitation of ten years, and on the trial the court decided in their favor on that plea. Appellant has brought the case here on appeal; and the sole question presented is whether or not such holding of the court below was correct. It is conceded that appellees’ possession had lasted for a sufficient length of time to bar appellant’s title, if possessing the other requisites; and the question for our determination is whether or not such possession was adverse. The evidence introduced by appellees was, that the land was enclosed, as shown above, at the date of the deeds from Yarbrough and Wimberley to Swann and from Burress to Mrs. House, respectively; that they bought with reference to the enclosures, supposing their deeds passed title to the area within the fences; and that they had held open, notorious, and visible possession ever since, claiming to the fences as their boundaries, and recognizing no other claim to the land embraced therein. In view of the findings of the court below, we must conclude that these are the true facts, notwithstanding some conflict in the evidence as to the time when the fences ""were placed as they now stand. Appellant never had any of the 8 acres enclosed. The mesne conveyances under which appellees claim embrace only the land described in the deeds from appellant to Rowland and Burress. In 1888 a survey of the premises was made, disclosing the fact that appellees had land enclosed which was not embraced in their deeds as above explained. Until that survey was made appellees did not know what area was enclosed within their fences, though Swann had paid taxes on an acre and a quarter. The following letter from Swann to appellant, of date December 27, 1888, was offered in evidence. “ I find you are right about the strip of land in rear of myself and House, a part of which we have enclosed and paid taxes on for over fifteen years, thinking survey was all right until this survey. I have conferred with Reuben House, and am authorized to make this offer to quiet and clear titles of all cloud on his part and mine: We will pay you $100 net cash for the two strips of land which lie in the form of a T; we will have deed written at our costs by Dr. Wells, and will forward you for signing. Let me hear from you.” Negotiations followed concerning the purchase by appellees of the land still owned by appellant, adjoining the lands of the former, but no agreement was arrived at. Swann acted as appellant’s agent to render and pay taxes upon land other than that embraced in the enclosures from 1876 until 1883. He was not appellant’s agent with reference to the land in controversy, and did not recognize his title to it. In the summer of 1889, while the parties were negotiating for a settlement, appellant asked appellees if they intended to try to take his property from him by limitation, and Swann replied that he could not afford to plead the statute against appellant. House made no reply. The letter was written, and these conversations took place, in the effort to settle their differences, and in connection with the offer by appellees to purchase the land they had enclosed and that adjoining it. We think this evidence is sufficient to show that appellees’ possession was adverse. The case differs from those where one extends his fence upon the land of an adjoining owner, intending only to assert a claim to the true line when ascertained. In such cases the possessor recognizes the title of his neighbor to the land defined by the true boundary, when that is ascertained, and hence his enclosure of a part of the land that does not belong to him is not hostile. Huckshorn v. Hartwig, 81 Mo., 648; Winn v. Abiles, 35 Kan., 85. Here appellees bought with reference to the enclosures, and all the time claimed all the land embraced by them, and recognized no oth er right. The fact that they supposed they owned all the land enclosed does not render their claim any the less hostile, but rather strengthens it. The authorities cited all recognize the distinction. Alexander v. Wheeler, 69 Ala., 340. In the case last cited the rule is thus stated: “ If a partition fence be extended by one of two adjacent owners, so as to embrace within his enclosure a portion of his neighbor’s land, through mere inadvertence or ignorance of the location of the real line, or for the purpose of convenience, and with no intention to claim such extended area, but intending to claim adversely only to the real or true boundary line, wherever it may be, such possession would not be adverse or hostile to the true owner. There can be no adverse possession without a coincident intention to claim title. If the claim, in other words, is not up to the partition fence as extended, but only to the true line, there would be no adverse holding of the new enclosure, but only up to the true dividing line. But the rule is different where the fence is believed to be the true line, and the claim of ownership is up to the fence as located, even though the established division line is erroneous and the claim of title was the result of the mistake. In such case there is a clear intention to claim to the fence as the true line, and the possession does not originate in admitted possibility of mistake.” The Texas cases cited by appellant do not conflict with this. Tucker v. Smith, 68 Texas, 481; Bracken v. Jones, 63 Texas, 184; Blassingame v. Davis, 68 Texas, 598. Delivered November 17, 1892. The title had vested in appellees before their negotiation concerning a purchase. These were engaged in for the purpose of compromising differences and clearing the title, and under well recognized principles of law should not be allowed to prejudice the claim of either party. The judgment was right, and it is affirmed. Affirmed.","J. T. Hand v. A. J. Swann et al. No. 22. 1. Possession, when Adverse. — In 1871 E, purchased from appellant 1 acre of land out of an 8 acres tract owned by him, out of the southwest corner, 157 by 281 feet in size, and B. purchased of appellant 1 acre in the northwest corner of said 8 acres tract, 157 by 281 feet. In 1875, by virtue of these titles, the then owners had enclosed their respective lots; in one of them there was an area of 170% by 308 feet, and in the other 1G9)£ by 308 feet. They sold to the vendor of one of the appellees, and the ancestor of the other. These sales were made with reference to the enclosures, but by the same description as in the original deeds. These vendors and the appellees believed that they were buying all the land within the enclosures; they recognized no adverse right, and supposed that they owned all the land enclosed. Suit was brought by appellant in January, 1890, for the unsold strip of land thus appropriated. Held, appellees’ possession must be deemed adverse, and their titles good by limitation, although after the excess was first discovered, by a survey made in 1888, appellees made a proposition to appellant to purchase it. 2. Possession, when not Adverse. — The case differs from those where one extends his fence upon the land of an adjoining owner, intending only to assert title to the true line when ascertained. In such cases the possession recognizes the title of his neighbor to the land defined by the true boundary, when it is ascertained, and hence his enclosure of a part of the land that does not belong to him is not hostile. 3. Same. — If the claim of ownership is not up to the partition fence, but only to the true line, there would heno adverse holding except to the true dividing line. But where the fence is believed to be the true line, and claim of ownership is up to it as located on the ground, even though the line as established by the fence is erroneous, the possession does not originate in admitted possibility of mistake, and the possession is adverse. 4. Negotiations for Purchase. — Title had vested in appellees before the negotiations concerning a purchase, which were engaged in for the purpose of compromising differences and clearing title, and under well recognized principles of law should not be allowed to prejudice the claim of either party.. Appeal from Smith. Tried below before Hon. Felix J. McCord. C. G. White, for appellant. 1. The principal question in this case is a question of boundaries; and there being no law of limitations as to boundaries, the courts presume only after a long lapse of time, where both parties have their property enclosed, that they have acquiesced in a boundary fence between them. Rev. Stats., arts. 3194, 3198; Floyd v. Rice, 28 Texas, 341; Tucker v. Smith, 68 Texas, 473; Blassingame v. Davis, 68 Texas, 595; Word v. Drouthett, 44 Texas, 370; Bracken v. Jones, 63 Texas, 184. 2. The court erred in holding that limitations commenced to run in favor of defendants from the time they enclosed the strips of land claimed by each of them respectively, because the evidence shows they enclosed and held the same by mistake and in ignorance of the true boundaries, both on the part of the plaintiff and defendants.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. The conclusions of fact reached by the court from the evidence in this cause are: That in 1830 the government of Coahuila and Texas conceded to Jose Maria Aguirre, Raphael Aguirre, and Tomas de la Yega, residents of Coahuila, and Mexican citizens, each eleven leagues of land, the concessions being made under the-colonization law of 1825, and under the conditions prescribed by said act. That in the year 1832 Stephen F. Austin purchased said three concessions from the said Jose Maria and Raphael Aguirre and the said Tomas de la Yega, and in accordance with the request of said Austin, they constituted Samuel May Williams, who was the secretary of Austin’s Colony at the time, their attorney in fact, to procure titles for said thirty-three leagues of land, and to take possession thereof, and to sell the same to such person or persons, and for such price or prices, and upon such terms as he, the said Williams, might determine. That the power thus conferred upon said Williams is evidenced by a testimonio, executed on the 5th of May, A. D. 1832, in the city of Leona Vicario, in the State of Coahuila, by Juan Gonzales, regidor of the ayuentamiento of said city, and second alcalde of the same and its jurisdiction, owing to the sickness of the incumbent of said office, and acting by authority in the absence of a notary within said jurisdiction, with three instrumental witnesses and two assisting witnesses. That said testimonio was proved for record in 1856, by the affidavit of Juan Seguin, made before the clerk of the County Court of Travis County, and the affidavit of James Hewitson, made before the clerk of the County Court of Galveston County, each affiant averring that he was acquainted with the handwriting of Juan Gonzales, whose signature was to the instrument purporting to be a power of attorney from Jose Maria Aguirre, Raphael Aguirre, and Tomas Yega, and executed on the 5tli of May, 1832, before said Gonzales, regidor of Leona Vicario; and that he believed the said signature to be that of said Gonzales; and further, that said affiant was acquainted with the handwriting of each of said persons whose names were signed to said instrument as assisting witnesses; and that said affiant believed the signature of each of said witnesses written upon said instrument was his genuine signature; and that said power of attorney was afterwards duly recorded in said year 1856, in the office of the county clerk for McLennan County, and also in the office of the clerk of the County Court for Falls County. That said Juan Gonzales, in the following year, 1857, appeared before Peter Dowd, the then clerk of Starr County, and acknowledged that said instrument was executed before him, and that he signed the same, as recited therein, at the request of said Tomas Yega, Raphael Aguirre, and Jose Maria Aguirre, and by their authority and their direction, and in their presence, and that his signature to said paper is genuine, and that he signed the same as regidor of the corporation of the city of Saltillo, and second alcalde, in the year 1832, as expressed in said instrument; and that the signatures of Jose Nazo Ortiz and Jose N. Moval, signed to said instrument, are the genuine signatures of said witnesses, and that they signed same in his presence as assisting witnesses. That said testimonio, shortly after the death of Stephen F. Austin, was, with other papers pertaining to his estate, deposited by the representative of said estate in the General Land Office of this State, and remained among the archives of that office from the time it was there placed by said representative until the year 1854, when it was withdrawn by Robert Hughes, counsel for the plaintiff John W. Lapsley, in the prosecution of suits for the ejectment of trespassers upon the said Vega grant. That the signatures of Gonzales and his assisting witnesses in the execution of said power of attorney were again .proved by the depositions of said Juan Seguin and of other witnesses, taken during the pendency of this suit and read upon the trial thereof. That the said Samuel May Williams procured the title from the proper authority in Austin’s Colony for said eleven leagues grant to La Vega, and that the land was surveyed and Williams placed in possession thereof. That said land was conveyed by Williams in 1840 to Mrs. Sophia St. John, for a valuable consideration, with the assent of said Austin; and that said purchaser from Williams conveyed the same in 1850 to John W. Lapsley, who held the title in trust for himself, Watrous, Price, Plattenberg, Goldsby, Frow, and League, parties to this suit. That the purchasers from and under Williams have held possession of the lands since 1849, and taxes have been paid by said purchasers upon the lands since 1846. That La Vega never claimed or asserted title to the lands after the execution of said testimonio of 5th of May, 1832, until 1868, in which year he instituted two suits, one in chancery and one at law, in the Circuit Court of the United States at Austin, the object of which suits was to have said testimonio cancelled, and to recover from Lapsley and his co-defendants Watrous, League, and others, damages for the use and occupation of said lands purchased by them under said testimonio of said La Vega; and in each of these suits judgment was rendered adversely to said La Vega, and for said defendants. That another suit, instituted and determined in said Circuit Court, between the mother and father of the McPhauls, intervenors in this suit, and the said Lapsley, involved the title of the Peter Flemming league, which was located on the La Vega grant several years after the La Vega title was extended, and the land appropriated thereunder by the said Samuel May Williams, and the said La Vega' intervened in that suit, and again brought in issue the validity of said testimonio or power of attorney; and said case was decided in favor of said Lapsley and against La Vega. The conclusions of the court upon the law of the case are: That the title to the land in controversy was vested, by virtue of the testimonio of May 5, 1832, which was extended by the defendant La Vega before the said Juan Gonzales, as regidor and second alcalde of the city of Leona Vicario, and the subsequent mesne conveyances, in the said John W. Lapsley. That said testimonio is in due form, and is properly authenticated. That the same was admissible in evidence as an ancient instrument; and that the court did not err in admitting same in evidence over objections of appellants. That the title of the McPhauls under the grant to their ancestor, Peter Flemming, to the land in controversy, was void as to all claiming and holding under the La Vega grant. That the records in three following causes tried and determined in the Circuit Court of the United States at Austin, to-wit, number 37; chancery suit, and numbers 1093 and 1045, in each of which the said Lapsley and the said La Vega were parties, were properly admitted in evidence by the court, over the objections of appellants; nor did the court err in refusing to permit appellants to read in evidence, upon objection by appellees, the answer of Jose de la Vega, filed in said cause number 37, in reply to cross-bill filed therein by said Lapsley, a defendant in said suit. And lastly, our conclusion is, that if error was committed upon the trial of this cause by the court in the admission of evidence or the rejection of evidence offered by appellants, such errors were immaterial as to the issue of title between appellants and appellees, inasmuch as no other judgment under the evidence could have been rendered than one denying the claim of La Vega’s heirs and those claiming under him by conveyances since the 5th of May, A. D. 1832, to the land in controversy, and decreeing the title to be in John W. Lapsley and his copurchasers under the said testimonio, and through mesne conveyances from said Williams. This suit was instituted in the District Court of Galveston County, 1874, by Mrs. Esther Y. League and her children, heirs of Thomas M. League, against John W. Lapsley, the heirs of T. B. Goldsby, W. Plattenberg, J. T. Frow, the heirs of J. L. Price, Simon Mussina, N. B. Yard, George Butler, and Tomas de la Vega, and was consolidated with a suit then pending in said court, and instituted therein-in 1860 by John W. Lapsley against Thomas M. League and John C. Watrous, to recover on a note of said League and said Watrous, for $4533, executed on 9th of July, A. D. 1850. The object of the consolidated suit was to recover the amount due upon the note executed by League and Watrous, and also certain moneys alleged to be due to John W. Lapsley and his attorney in fact, the said Thomas League, for services rendered and moneys expended by them on account of eleven leagues of land, situated in McLennan County and known as the La Vega grant, and for a partition of said grant between the parties entitled thereto, upon the payment bjr them of the moneys alleged to be due to said Lapsley and said League. It was averred, that prior to the execution of said note by League and Watrous, said League had contracted for the purchase of said grant of land, and also for a large number of land certificates; and being unable to complete the purchase, the said Watrous induced the said Lapsley, Goldsby, Plattenbcrg, Frow, and Price to furnish the purchase money, and to become joint purchasers of said property with himself and the said Thomas M. League. That Lapsley and his said four associates furnished the entire purchase money, the sum being $9064, and by agreement between all parties in interest the title to said grant of land and to the said land certificates was placed in the said Lapsley; and when the said note executed for $4532 by League and Watrous, the same being for one-half of the purchase money, should be paid by League and Watrous, and certain other moneys in said agreement mentioned and promised, Lapsley was to make a conveyance of one-half of all of said property to them, and the other half to be owned in equal shares by Lapsley and the said Goldsby, Plattenbcrg, Frow, and Price. The petition alleged, that Watrous never paid any portion of said note, but that the note was paid by said League and his representatives, and thereby they, the heirs and representatives of League, acquired a lien on ■said lands for the money so advanced for said Watrous. It was further alleged, that Watrous conveyed his interest in trust to W. B. Yard, to secure an indebtedness to George Butler, and that said interest had been also purchased at sheriff’s sale by one Moreland, through his attorney in fact, one E. J. Gurley, and that one Alexander, as attorney in fact for Moreland, had conveyed said interest of said Watrous to said Simon Mussina, and that Mussina had conveyed same to La Vega, but that the authority of Alexander to make such conveyance was denied by Moreland. And the petition further averred, that the said Thomas J. Frow also asserted a claim, the character and nature of which was not known, to the interest of Watrous in said property. The petition neither admitted nor denied the rights or claims of La Vega, Frow, Moreland, or Butler, but prayed that all parties be required to interplead and establish their interests, all of which it was averred to be subordinate to the rights of Lapsley. In accordance with the prayers of the petitioner, Lapsley, La Vega, Mussina, Yard, Butler, Moreland, Plattenberg, Frow, and the heirs of Price and of Goldsby were made defendants. Watrous having died, his heirs became parties defendant, and denied the rights of the various claimants to the interest of the deceased in said property, and asserted title thereto, and also set up homestead claim. Lapsley answered, alleging his expenses, services, and disbursements-in protecting title, for which he prayed compensation and reimbursement. Goldsby’s heirs, and heirs of Price and of Plattenberg, and Frow, Butler, Yard, La Vega, and Mussina, all appeared and answered. Mussina and La Vega answered, that they claimed the interest of Watrous through purchase from Moreland; that they purchased the same only to secure their peace under a title already existing and superior to-that of plaintiffs and their codefendants. They averred further, that they had been ejected from their lands by the said Lapsley and his associates, on January 1, 1873. And by amended answer, filed on the 7th of March, A. D. 1876, La Vega averred, that the alleged purchase and agreement of July 9, 1850, by and between the said Lapsley and his-said associates, Frow, Price, Plattenberg, Goldsby, and the said League and Watrous, was a fraudulent contrivance and combination, made and done to defraud defendant out of his said tract of land; and that they and others acting in complicity with them did wrongfully and fraudulently make use of and utter a certain false instrument in writing, purporting to be the testimonio of an act of defendant, for the purpose of' deraigning title to said eleven leagues of land granted to defendant -by the government of Texas and Coahuila; which said instrument, purporting to be a power of attorney to Sam May Williams, executed on the 5th of May, A. D. 1832, at Leona Vicario, now Saltillo, and empowering said Williams to take possession of and to sell said lands, defendant charged to be a forgery. Subsequently, N. A. McPhaul, as next friend of his minor children, intervened in the suit, and claimed one-fourth of a league of land, part-of the La Vega grant of eleven leagues, by inheritance from Peter Flemming, to whom a league of land was granted in 1835, and which was located within the boundaries of the La Vega grant; and it was further claimed for said children, that they were owners of said one-fourth league by purchase through their deceased mother from La Vega. This claim was admitted by La Vega and Mussina, and pleas in reconvention were filed by La Vega and Mussina, who also claimed by purchase from La Vega a portion of the grant to La Vega. Plaintiffs excepted to these pleas of reconvention, and pleaded in abatement thereto, and pleaded also res judicata. The exceptions were sustained, and also the plea in abatement; and upon motion of plaintiffs, defendants La Vega and Mussina were dismissed from the suit; and on trial of the case verdict and judgment were rendered for the parties claiming title from Sam Williams, under and by virtue of the testimonio of date May 5, 1832, empowering him, as the attorney in fact of La Vega, to sell the said eleven leagues. And Moreland, who claimed to be the owner of Watrous’ interest in the property, recovered nothing. From this judgment an appeal was prosecuted to the Supreme Court, and that court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for another trial. 64 Texas, 205. Upon the second trial in the court below, Mussina and the heirs of La Vega (he having died), and also the heirs of McPhaul, being parties defendant, and claiming title as in their pleadings filed before the first judgment, the jury found against Mussina and La Vega and McPhaul, and judgment was rendered against them, and the land decreed to be divided among those claiming under the purchase made by Lapsley in 1850, and Moreland was adjudged to be the owner of Watrous’ share of the property; and judgments for money were also rendered in favor of Lapsley and League, in accordance with their prayer, and the lands were charged with their debts; and there was also a moneyed judgment in favor of defendant Frow, which was declared to be a lien, subordinate, however, to the claims of Lapsley and League, upon Watrous’ interest. And the decree, after adjudging that the parties to whom the lands were adjudged should pay the judgments in favor of League and Lapsley, each in proportion to his share in said lands, further directed, that if these judgments were not paid within six months, execution might issue and be levied upon so much of the eleven leagues as should be necessary to satisfy the judgments. Motion for new trial having been overruled, Mussina and the heirs of La Vega and the McPhauls excepted thereto in open court, on the 31st of March, A. D. 1888, and gave notice of appeal; and upon motion of the parties ten days were given by the court in which to prepare and file a statement of facts. And afterwards, to-wit, on the 31st of March, A. D. 1890, the defendant Mussina having died, the executor of his will, joined by the heirs of La Vega and by the McPhauls, sued out a writ of error, and by their counsel filed this transcript in the Supreme Court, and-errors; were assigned by plaintiffs in error, and also by the personal representative of the appellee Frow. But there is no brief filed in this court for any of the plaintiffs in error, nor is there an appearance for any one of them here. The appellees, the heirs of Thomas M. League, appear by counsel, and suggesting delay, ask for an affirmance of the judgment. We have not felt called upon, under these circumstances, to consider any of the plaintiffs’ assignments save such as refer to and question the correctness of the judgment in sustaining the title of Lapsley, Frow, Piice, Platlenberg, Goldsby, and Watrous and League as purchasers from the defendant La Vega, under his alleged power of attorney to Samuel M. Williams, as evidenced by the instrument purporting to have been executed on the 5th of May, A. D. 1832, in the city of Leona Vicario, in the State of Coahuila, Mexico. Nor have we considered any of the errors assigned by the appellees, the representatives of Frow. We do not understand that an appellee or defendant in error is privileged to assign errors as against his codefendants or coappellees, as is attempted in this case. An appellee or defendant in error may assign as against the appellant or plaintiff in error, but he can not require a revision of any alleged error committed in adjudicating upon the rights of himself and his codefendants unless he appeals. We have carefully examined the voluminous record of this case, and finding no error which in our opinion would authorize us to reverse or reform the judgment, it is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 2, 1893.","FIRST DISTRICT, FEBRUARY, 1893. Heirs of Tomas de la Vega v. J. C. League, John W. Lapsley, et al. No. 84. 1. The La Vega Eleven League Grant Valid. —The testimonio of May 5, 1832, which was extended by La Vega before Juan Gonzales, regidor and second alcalde of the city of Leona Vicario, conferring upon Samuel M. Williams-power to procure title and sell the eleven league concession to La Vega, is in due form of law, and properly authenticated, and the same was admissible in evidence as an ancient instrument. 2. Authentication for Record.—See statement of the case by the court for evidence of authentication of a testimonio, dated in 1882, of a concession of"" eleven leagues of land made in 1830, by the government of Coahuila and Texas,, held sufficient to authorize its registration and admission in evidence. 3. Title of the La Vega Heirs and their Vendees.—La Vega having sold his concession to Stephen F. Austin, and at the request of Austin having by the testimonio of 1832 constituted Samuel M. Williams his attorney in fact to procure title for his eleven leagues, take possession, and sell them for such prices and upon such terms as he might see fit; and Williams having procured title, been placed in possession, and sold, his vendees have better title than the heirs of La Vega or their vendees; title not having been claimed by La Vega until 1868, in which year he instituted suits in the United States Circuit Court, seeking to have the testimonio cancelled, but failed in all of them. 4. Evidence of Character.—It being claimed by La Vega that the testimonio was fraudulently obtained, and was forged, it was not error to admit evidence of the character of Stephen F. Austin and Samuel May Williams. 5. Title under the La Vega Testimonio better than the Flemming Grant.—The Peter Flemming league was located upon the La Vega grant, and in this suit the McPhauls claimed under it. This grant was void as against all persons holding under the La Vega grant and sale by Williams. 6. Evidence Admissible as Res Gestae. — In two suits filed in the United States Circuit Court by La Vega, against Lapsley, League, and others, the object of which suits was to have the testimonio of 1832 to Williams cancelled, upon the ground of fraud and forgery, and to recover damages for the use and occupation of the land by the defendants, the judgments rendered were adverse to La Vega. Another suit in said court, between the mother and father of the McPhauls (interveners in this suit) and Lapsley, League, et al., involved the title •of the Peter Flemming league. Therein La Vega intervened, and again brought in issue the validity of the testimonio of 1832, and said suit was decided in favor of Lapsley, League, et al. The records in these three cases were admissible as evidence in this case. 7. Answer of La Vega held Inadmissible in Evidence.—In one of the Circuit Court cases (No. 37 in chancery) in response to a cross-bill of discovery filed by Lapsley, League, et al., La Vega filed a sworn answer. The court below did not err in refusing to allow this answer to be read in evidence. 8. Immaterial Errors by Trial Court.—If error was committed by the court below in the admission or exclusion of evidence, such errors were immaterial. as no other judgment could have been rendered under the evidence in this case than that which was rendered. 9. Form of Judgment.—Suit by the League heirs against Lapsley et al., to recover on a note claimed to be part of the purchase money of the La Vega grant, and other moneys expended in perfecting that title; prayer for foreclosure of a lien upon the land for said debt, and for partition of the La Vega grant between the part owners. See opinion for form of judgment in such case which was affirmed. 10. Errors not Considered.—There is no brief filed for any of the plaintiffs in error, nor any appearance for any of them. Defendants in error suggest delay. We have not felt called upon to consider any of the plaintiffs’ assignments save such as question the correctness of the judgment in sustaining the title of the defendants in error as purchasers from La Vega through the Williams testimonio. 11. Errors Assigned by Defendants Against each Other.—We do not understand that a defendant in error is privileged to assign errors against his codefendants, unless he appeals. Without appeal, he can not require a revision of any alleged error committed in adjudicating upon the rights of himself and his codefendants, as between each other. Error from Galveston.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. This suit was instituted by the appellee, John Roemer, against the appellant, the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company, in the County Court of Guadalupe County, on the 11th day of September, 1888, for the avowed purpose of recovering damages of the said defendant in the sum of $1000 — $500 actual and $500 exemplary damages. The plaintiff alleged that on the 17th day of February, 1887, he purchased of defendant’s agent at Seguin a ticket which entitled him to one passage from the depot in Seguin to the depot in Kingsbury, a distance of about ten miles. That on the said 17th day of February, 1887, at about 9 o’clock p. m., he boarded the cars of defendant, and that soon after said train had pulled out from the depot at Seguin the conductor came to plaintiff and took up his said ticket. That defendant’s servants failed to check said train of cars when the station of Kingsbury was reached, but that said train ran by said station at a great rate of speed, and never checked until it ran about two and one-half miles beyond said station, when it came to a halt; and that the servants of said defendant in charge of said train willfully deceived plaintiff and caused him to leave said train at a point two and one-half miles from the station of Kingsbury, the place of his destination. lie further alleged that the night was dark, cold, and rainy, and that he was in the manner aforesaid induced to leave said train at a late hour of the night, and that in making his way home to Kingsbury he slipped and many times fell, and from said falls received injuries to his person and suffered great mental and physical pain, to his damage aforesaid. The defendant answered, first, by setting up by special demurrer the statute of one year’s limitation — the plaintiff having alleged that his injuries complained of were received on the 17th day of February, 1887, and the suit having been commenced on the 11th day of September, 1888. It further plead specially limitation of one year; that “while the train ran by the station of Kingsbury, which was for the train on which plaintiff was being transported only a flag station, that said train was never checked at said station unless some one wished to get off or on said train. That the servants in charge of the train were aware that plaintiff wished to get off at Kingsbury, but that the bell cord became foul on approaching the said station and the conductor was thereby prevented from giving the usual signal for the engineer to stop said train, and in consequence of said unavoidable accident the train was pulled by said station for a distance of about four hundred yards, where plaintiff voluntarily got off from said train; that nothing on the part of the servants of defendant was done in malice or hatred.” The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and gave him $500 damages — $250 exemplary damages and $250 actual damages — and it is from this verdict and judgment this appeal is taken. The first assignment of error complains of the action of the trial court in overruling the special demurrer addressed to the petition, on account of the action being barred by the statutes of limitation of one year, the suit being filed about eighteen months after the injuries complained of were received. The contention of appellant is that the action is one of tort, and is barred in one year from the date of infliction of the injuries, and is regulated by subdivision 1 of article 3202, Revised Statutes. Upon the other hand, the appellee contends that the cause of action is based upon a breach of the contract to safely deliver and put him down at the place agreed upon. Which of these diverse views is correct, presents the question for our determination. The basis of this action rests not upon the naked violation of the contract to safely put the passenger down at the station agreed upon, but for the personal injuries received by the passenger growing out of negligent failure of the appellant to perform its duty to the appellee, and for the willful conduct of the servants of appellant in inducing appellee to leave the train at the point other than his destination. The damages sought to be recovered flow from mental and physical injuries sustained by appellee, resulting from the gross negligence of the servants of appellant. The foundation of every tort lies in the violation of some legal duty or some unlawful act or omission. The essence of the wrong in this case consists in the violation of the duty that the carrier owed to the passenger, and the willful and negligent failure to perform the acts tending to an observance of this duty. This duty is a thing different from the mere contract obligation, and the right of action rests not alone upon the contract obligations of the parties, but upon the negligence in failure to observe this legal duty. ‘ ‘ The duty and the tort grow out of the entire range of facts, of which the breach of the contract was but one.” New Orleans, Jackson & Great Northern Railway Company v. Hurst, 36 Mississippi, 665, was a case in which the carrier carried the passenger beyond the station agreed upon in the contract of carriage, and compelled Mm to leave the train at a place beyond such station. The jury in this case awarded the plaintiff $4500, and it was insisted upon the part of the railroad company that the action was one of contract, and no special damages being claimed in the declaration, and as exemplary damages were not recoverable, the verdict of the jury was excessive. The court say: “Under our system of pleading, the formal distinctions between actions are abolished, and the declaration states the facts which constitute the cause of action plainly, distinctly, and substantially. In determining, therefore, the character of action, we look to the substance of the whole statement and not to the mere formal language in which it is expressed. * * * Hence, where facts are plainly and distinctly stated, the action will be regarded as either in tort or contract; having-regard, first, to the character of the remedy such facts indicate; and second, to the most complete and ample redress which, upon the facts stated, the law can afford; with due regard to the rights of the defendant. The character of the action must be determined by the nature of the grievance rather than the form of the declaration. And in cases of this character (against common carriers), the courts are inclined to consider it as founded in tort, unless a special contract very clearly appears to be made the gravamen and object of the complaint in the declaration. These doctrines are clearly and distinctly announced in the case of Heim v. McCaughn, 32 Mississippi, 39. “ The case before us presents under these views the inquiry whether this declaration seeks to recover damages for the breach of the contract stated therein, or whether the wrong or injury complained of was that the defendant in error, after acquiring the right to travel on plaintiff’s cars, by contract, to a certain depot, while lawfully in the enjoyment of that right, was compelled to leave said cars at a distance from the place of his destination, by defendant ? “ The contract is stated as inducement to the action; as the foundation of the defendant’s in error right to be in the cars; to show that he was lawfully there. ‘ ‘ The declaration next shows that without the consent and against the remonstrance of the defendant in error, he was forcibly carried beyond the point where it was the duty of plaintiff in error to have allowed him to stop, and the declaration shows that he was compelled to leave the train at that point. Here is not only a breach of contract and violation of a public duty by the carrier, but a willful and forcible wrong. The case is therefore much stronger for defendant in error than were the facts in the case of Heim v. McCaughn, 32 Mississippi, 1. “A violation of a general duty to the public was in this case regarded as sufficient to determine the character of the action as one founded in tort and not in contract, and sufficient to authorize the jury in awarding exemplary damages. The decision in this case is conclusive of the question presented in this as to the form of action as well as the right of the jury in such cases to find the damages.” Cregin v. Brooklyn Crosstown Railway Company, 75 New York, 192, was an action by the husband against a carrier to recover for loss of services of the wife, and for expenses paid in consequence of injuries to her person, resulting from defendant’s negligence while she was a passenger. Held by the court to be an action grounded in tort. From the entire range of the facts as pleaded, it appears that the contract was simply alleged as matter of inducement showing the obligation resting upon appellant, and of appellee’s right to be upon its train of cars. And that the gravamen of the action rests upon the violation of the duty resting upon appellant, of which the breach of the contract is simply an incident. The facts show an action for personal injuries resulting from a violation of the duty owing to appellee by the appellant. If it was simply an action founded upon contract, upon what principle could exemplary damages be awarded, as are claimed in the petition ? In the absence of our statute giving a cause of action to the heirs of a decedent, could the heirs of appellee have maintained a suit in the event he had died from the injuries complained of in this case ? We think not. It is just such character of action, as is fully illustrated by the books, that does not survive at common law. If it was an action simply upon contract, it would survive and the heirs would have their remedy. We think the court erred in not sustaining the demurrer. It is claimed by appellee that there is an allegation showing damage done to the clothes worn upon the person of appellee at the time the injuries were received, and that such damage being to property, that item is not affected by the statute of limitations of one year. We do not regard the pleadings as having this effect. There is no express allegation showing any amount of damages to the clothes of appellee. And the entire claim for damages seems to be based upon the mental and personal injuries received by the appellee. Delivered October 26, 1892. Judgment reversed and rendered in favor of appellant. Reversed and rendered.","Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company v. John Roemer. No. 28. 1. Cause of Action — Tort.—An action for damages, actual and exemplary, by a passenger against a railway company for carrying him beyond his point of destination and wrongfully putting him off the train, is in tort, although the petition alleged the purchase by plaintiff of a ticket from the railway company. 2. Tort — Limitation.— An action for damages by a passenger against a railway company for carrying him beyond his destination and putting him off the train at a distance from the station at which he should have been allowed to leave, is barred by limitation of one year. 3. Damages to Clothing of Passenger — Pleading.—Where the petition contained no express allegation as to damages caused to clothing of the plaintiff, but the claim for damages was based upon mental and bodily injuries received by the plaintiff, and the action appears to have been brought eighteen months after the injury, exceptions that the cause of action is barred by limitation of one year should have been sustained. General allegations as to injury to the clothing would not save the action from the effect of the statute of limitations of one year. Appeal from the County Court of Guadalupe County.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. This case having been tried in the court-below by the judge without a jury, his conclusions of fact, which we find sustained by the evidence, may be briefly stated as follows: On October 2,1873, J. A. Truelove, then an unmarried man, purchased the lot in controversy from J. M. Lindsay, paying therefor the sum of $37.50. The deed was first made to said Truelove, but on the same day he had Lindsay to erase his own initials and insert those of his maiden sister, E.'J. Truelove. The deed when so changed appeared upon its face to convey to the grantee, E. J. Truelove, for a cash consideration, the title to said lot in fee simple. At the time of the making of this deed, however, it was expressly agreed between J. A. Truelove and his sisters-E. J. Truelove, and N. J. Townsend (the last named being a widow), that the said E. J. Truelove should hold said lot in trust upon the following terms, to-wit: That she and her said sister should have the right to live thereon as their home during their lives, or such less time as they might see proper to occupy it, but upon their death or abandonment of' the same as a home, it was to be the property of the said J. A. Truelove. In 1887 E. J. Truelove died, leaving a will bequeathing said lot, one-half to J. A. Truelove and the remainder to appellant Holland, as her executrix, to be used in improving a lot in the Gainesville cemetery. Upon such death, however (the said N. G. Townsend having long previously abandoned the lot), the said J. A. Truelove took possession of same, asserting his right thereto under the terms of the trust herein before set forth, and conveyed it to appellee Farthing. Appellants claim title under the will and as heirs of said E. J. Truelove. The court found the trust in favor of J. A. Truelove sufficiently established by the evidence, and rendered judgment in favor of appellee claiming thereunder. That an express trust is not within our statute of frauds, and can therefore be established -by paroi evidence, has long been settled by repeated decisions in this State. Mead v. Randolph, 8 Texas, 191; Bailey v. Harris, 19 Texas, 109; Leakey v. Gunter, 25 Texas, 400; Vandever v. Freeman, 20 Texas, 334; Clark v. Haney, 62 Texas, 511; Norfleet v. McCall, 80 Texas, 236; Brotherton v. Weathersby, 73 Texas, 471; Neyland v. Bendy, 69 Texas, 711. While we have been unable to find any case in this State in which the agreement creating a trust contemplated the occupation of the land by the trustee during his life, we are unable to distinguish such an agreement, in principle, from that recognized as valid in a number of cases-cited above. In the case of Johnson v. Johnson, 16 Minnesota, 512, the facts were ■quite similar to those developed by this record, and in that case the court found against the trust; but we think the reasons given for the decision under the statute of that State would go far to maintain its validity in this. The statute of that State provides, “ that no trust or power over or concerning lands, or in any manner relating thereto, shall hereafter be created, granted, assigned, surrendered, or declared, unless by act or -operation of law, or by deed or conveyance in writing, subscribed by the parties,” etc. Brown on Statute of Frauds, fourth edition, 606; and in the case above referred to, the court, after stating the facts, says: “ This state of facts does not give rise to any express trust in favor of the plaintiff, because there is no writing declaring the same; and there is no implied or resulting trust, because the statute declares, that when a grant for a valuable consideration shall be made to one person and the consideration therefor shall be paid by another, no use or trust shall result in favor of the person by whom such payment shall be made; but the title shall vest in the person named as the alienee in such conveyance, subject only to the provisions of the next section.” As we have no statute similar to that in Minnesota, this case, so much relied upon by appellants, we think instead of being an authority in their favor is strongly against them. By reference to our conclusions of fact, it will be seen that we are of opinion that the evidence of the trust in this case was sufficient to sustain the finding of the court below in its favor. Baylor v. Hopf, 81 Texas, 637. What we have said sufficiently indicates our views upon the other questions raised in the assignments of appellants. Let the judgment of the court below be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 24, 1893.","V. C. Holland, Executor, et al. v. A. J. Farthing. No. 77. Statute of Frauds—Express Trust—Parol Evidence.—An express trust in relation to land is not within the Texas statute oí frauds, and may therefore be established by paroi evidence and engrafted upon a deed absolute in terms; and the agreement creating the trust is valid, although it contemplates the occupation of the land by the trustee during his life. Appeal from Cooke. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Garnett & Eldridge, and Davis & Harris, for appellants. A deed absolute in form, as the deed from J. M. Lindsay to E. J.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Prior to July, 1889, appellants were, appointed by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Texas, receivers of the properties belonging to the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas, and were operating its roads. In August, 1889, appellee, claiming to be a passenger on one of the-trains thus controlled by appellants, was assaulted and injured by their servants employed to manage it. He brought this suit to recover damages resulting from such injuries. On the 11th day of May, 1891, while this suit was still pending, appellants were finally discharged from the receivership by the court which appointed them, and thereafter duly pleaded in this suit such discharge in bar of further proceedings against them. In the trial below the fact of the final discharge was admitted, and appropriate charges were presented to the court, declaring the law to be that such discharge constituted a complete bar to any judgment against appellants as receivers. The charges were refused, and verdict and judgment were rendered against appellants as receivers, and in this appeal this action of the court below is assigned as error. The Act of the Legislature of March 19, 1889, concerning receivers, was not in force when appellants were appointed, but had taken effect when the cause of action accrued to appellee, and was in full operation when this suit was brought and when appellants were discharged. It provides, that the discharge of a receiver shall not have the effect of abating any pending suit upon a cause of action which accrued against him as such receiver, but that such suit may be prosecuted to judgment, notwithstanding the discharge. One of the questions which arises as to the operation of those provisions upon this case is, do they apply to and control a discharge by a Federal court of a receiver appointed by it; and involved in this is the inquiry as to the power of a State Legislature to thus limit the effect of a decree of such a court. The receivers were appointed in the exercise of the chancery jurisdiction which belongs to all of the Circuit Courts of the United States. That jurisdiction was conferred upon such courts when they were first organized, and in cases in which it is properly called into exercise, it is determinable solely by the National legislation. Neither the substantive powers thus conferred, nor the rules of practice and procedure through which they are exercised, are subject to limitation or modification by the States. This equity jurisdiction, practice, and procedure of the courts is uniform throughout the Union, is the same in all of the States, and is beyond the control of State Legislatures. These principles have long been settled by the adjudications of the Supreme Court of the United States. Green v. Creighton, 23 How., 105; Hyde v. Stone, 20 How., 175; Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall., 425; United States v. Howland, 4 Cond. Rep., 406. A judgment or decree is the end for which the jurisdiction of a court is exercised. It is only through its judgments and their execution that the power of a court is made efficacious. A law which restricts their power to render a judgment is therefore a limitation upon the exercise of their jurisdiction; and a law which destroys or impairs the effect which their judgments without such law would have, is equally so. It is to be presumed that the Federal court properly acquired jurisdiction of the cause in which these receivers were appointed. That jurisdiction embraced power to dispose fully of all interests properly involved in the litigation, and to render all such judgments and decrees as were made appropriate to that end, by the principles of equity jurisprudence ■as they existed when such courts were organized, with such modifications as have been made from time to time by Congress, and the rules of those courts adopted in accordance therewith. That power could be controlled by Congress alone. By the principles governing the effect of judgments of courts of equity discharging their receivers, in the absence of the statute under consideration, such a judgment was made a bar to any further ■suit against such receiver for liability incurred solely by virtue of his office, and constituted, when pleaded in pending suits, a complete defense. Ryan v. Hays, 62 Texas, 47; Brown v. Gay, 76 Texas, 444. If, therefore, the discharge of appellants, when pleaded in this suit, was not a bar to further proceedings, it was because the act of the Legislature took from it the effect given to it by the law that created and governed the court that pronounced the decree. It is true, the statute does not in terms attempt to legislate directly upon the effect of the judgments of the courts of the United States, and we will advert to that presently. But if its operation should be what is claimed for it, the result would be much the same as if it had declared directly that no court of the Union should discharge a receiver while suits were pending in the State courts against him; or that a decree discharging such receiver pending such suits should not bar or abate the actions against him. A State Legislature can not so prescribe, because the National courts are not subject to State authority. It may be said that the statute only prescribes a rule for the guidance of State courts in suits pending before them against receivers, in the conduct of further proceedings after the discharge. But a State court must recognize a defenáe of a party litigant before it, whether it arise through the operation of a decree of another court or not; and the scope of the decree must be determined by the law under which it was pronounced. It may also be said, that inasmuch as the receiver, when appointed, is in a certain sense the representative of the owner of the property committed to his charge, it is competent for the Legislature to provide that he shall continue, after his discharge, to be such representative in suits brought before his discharge. The answer is, that receivers appointed by Federal courts, when they act within the proper limits of their jurisdiction, derive their authority from National laws, under which the court proceeds. It is only through the operation of such appointment, if at all, that the receiver is placed in the attitude of a representative. How long his authority as such may continue is a question committed to the judgment of the court whose authority he represents; and the operation of its order determining his relation to the property is derived and must be ascertained from the law under which that court has proceeded. The judgment of the Federal court must be recognized as having such effect, notwithstanding State statutes, not because of any paramount authority in those courts, but because they are independent of the control of the State, as are the courts of the State, except in respect of a few subjects, independent of National legislation. Riggs v. Johnson County, 6 Wall., 195. If this statute should be held to apply to the discharge by United States courts of receivers appointed by them, it seems plain to us, that the effect would be to impair the operation given to such discharge by the rules of equity jurisprudence governing such courts. A State can not do this, •either directly or indirectly. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat., 1. State laws are made the rule of decision for Federal courts, but can not control or affect their jurisdiction or procedure unless adopted by Congress or rule of court. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat., 1; Beers v. Houghton, 9 Pet., 359; Bayle v. Lachani, 6 Pet., 658; Bein v. Heath, 12 How., 168. It must therefore be held, that the provision of the statute which we have cited does not apply to the judgments of courts of the United States discharging receivers appointed by them. Indeed, it is by no means clear that such application was intended. The. Act of 1889 is an amendment to the Act of 1887 on the same subject, two sections of the last named act being substituted by the former. The Act of 1887 thus amended is entitled, “An act to provide for the appointment of receivers, and to define their powers and duties, and to regulate proceedings under such appointment of receivers.” Its first section begins: “That a receiver may be appointed by any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction in this State, in the following cases.” Many provisions follow, nearly all of which plainly apply only to proceedings in our own courts. In a few of the provisions, as in that we have considered, the language is broad enough to embrace all receivers, wherever appointed; but no mention is made of any others than those whose appointment is provided for by our own courts. It ought not to be presumed that it was intended by any general terms used to regulate that over which the Legislature had no authority. Bank of the United States v. Halstead, 10 Wheat., 51. The court below should therefore have given the charge requested by appellants, which instructed the jury to find in their favor. We intimate no opinion, however, as to the operation of the provisions of the statute creating a lien on property of the railway company, and authorizing other parties to be brought into the litigation, as they present questions differing from that which we have discussed. It will not therefore be determined whether or not, with proper parties before the court, a judgment, such as that rendered in this case, establishing a lien on the property, would be proper. The cases referred to by appellants are not like the present. In them it was held erroneous to declare and foreclose a, lien on property which was in the custody of the receiver of another court, pending the receivership. Here the receivers had been discharged and the court had relinquished its control over the property. Hew parties may be made in the court below, or a different state of facts may be developed, which will require another trial on the merits, and we therefore will proceed to examine the other points raised in the appeal. The court committed an error when it instructed the jury to allow damages for value of time lost by appellee, and expenses incurred by him for treatment of his injuries. There was some evidence tending, quite indefinitely, to show that some loss of time resulted to appellee from his-wounds, and it was shown that he was treated by physicians, but there was no evidence of the value of either. There was no error in the charge complained of in the fifth assignment. It was applicable to the evidence and expressed the law correctly. The refusal of special charges numbers 2,3, and 4 was not error. The evidence upon which these charges were predicated tended to show, that appellant, at Pollock, got on the platform of the baggage car, next to the tender, and rode there, without the knowledge of the conductor, until the train reached Baker’s Mill; that there he was discovered by the conductor, and then went into the smoking car. This was done openly and without concealment, and he was sitting quietly in the car, when he was approached by the conductor and assaulted, without any demand having been made for his fare, or any opportunity having been afforded him after he entered the car to pay it. After the conductor had struck him several blows, he demanded the fare, and appellee either paid or was in the act of paying it, when the assault was continued, and he was beaten, cut with a knife, and thrown from the train while it was in full motion. This is the state of facts shown by the record, and the rules of law relied on by appellants, and expressed in the special charges, have no application. It is not the case of a passenger who refuses to pay his fare when demanded, until the conductor has commenced his expulsion from the car, and who is then put off lawfully and with the exertion of no unnecessary force. In that kind of case, the authorities referred to hold that the passenger can not, after the expulsion has commenced, tender his fare and require the carrier’s servants to accept it and permit-him to remain on the cars. And he can not, at least at a place other than a station for receiving passengers, re-enter the same train, after he has been rightfully expelled, and become a passenger thereon. O’Brien v. Railway, 15 Gray, 20; Pease v. Railway, 26 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, 185. Appellee went in the car at Baker’s Mill, a regular passenger station, it is to be inferred from the evidence, and was assaulted before his fare had been demanded. , It is not shown that his fare for riding on the platform of the car had been demanded and refused, and, for all the record discloses, he may have been ready to pay his fare from Pollock to his destination. We can not hold that the mere fact that he rode from Pollock to Baker’s Mill on'the platform of the car, to escape paying his fare, if such be the case, would deprive him of the right to become a passenger at a regular station, when no demand had been made for his fare, and no disturbance or breach of the peace had been committed by him. In all of these respects the case differs from those cited. Besides, the uncontradicted evidence shows, that the conductor began his expulson with an assault; followed that with a demand for his fare from appellee, and upon that being paid or offered, continued the use of violence, striking and cutting appellee, and finally threw him from the cars and left him dangerously wounded and senseless. In this he was exercising his functions as conductor, and acted as the servant of appellants; and whether the relation of carrier and passenger existed or not, the master would be liable. Cool, on Torts, 536. The charges asked were therefore not applicable to the facts, and would have tended to confuse the jury. The portion of the charge complained of in the fifteenth assignment, whether correct or not, presents a hypothesis in appellants’ favor which we think the evidence did not raise. No view of the case more favorable to them could arise out of this evidence, and they can not complain of the charge. Because of errors indicated, the judgment is re /ersed and the cau°e remanded. ^ Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 12, 1893.","S. W. Fordyce and A. H. Swanson, Receivers, v. C. H. Beecher. No. 50. 1. Discharge of Federal Court Receiver Abates Suit.—The act of the State Legislature of March 19,18S9, providing that the discharge of a receiver shall not have the effect of abating any pending suit upon a cause of action against him as such receiver, but that such suit may be prosecuted to judgment notwithstanding the discharge, does not apply to judgments of courts of the United States discharging receivers appointed by them. 2. Same.—A judgment or decree is the end for which the jurisdiction of a court is exercised; it is only through its judgments and the execution of them that the power of the court is made efficacious. A law which restricts their power to render a judgment is therefore a limitation upon the exercise of their jurisdiction. 3. Federal Court Receivers.—Receivers appointed by the Federal court -derive their authority from National laws, under which the court proceeds. It is only through the operation of such appointment that the receiver is placed in the attitude of a representative of the owner of the property, and how long his authority as such may continue, is a question committed to the judgment of that court. 4. Scope and Intent of State Statute of 1889.—It is by no means ■clear that the Legislature intended the act to apply to Federal court receivers. Nearly all its provisions plainly apply only to proceedings in our own courts. In a few of its provisions, as in that we have considered, the language is broad enough to embrace all receivers, but no mention is made of any others than those whose appointment is provided for by our own courts, and it ought not to be presumed that it was intended by any general terms used to regulate that over which the Legislature had no authority. 5. Damages — Value of Time, and Expenses. — The jury should not have been instructed to allow damages for lost time or expenses incurred by plaintiff for treatment of his injuries, because there was no evidence of the value of either. 6. Assault of Passenger by Conductor.—Plaintiff got on the platform of the baggage car, and rode there without the knowledge of the conductor until the train reached Baker’s Mill. There he was discovered by the conductor, and went into the smoker, and was sitting quietly there when, he was assaulted by the conductor, without any demand having been made for his fare, or any opportunity afforded him, after entering the car, to pay it. Fare was then demanded, and plaintiff paid, or was in the act of paying it, when the assault was continued, and he was beaten, cut with a knife, thrown from the train, and left, dangerously wounded and senseless. The conductor was acting as the servant of appellants in the discharge of his functions as such, and charges predicated upon the theory that plaintiff got on the car, not intending to pay fare, but with the intention of defrauding the company, and getting a free ride, and upon the theory that the assault was not made by the conductor in the course of his employment, have no application and were properly refused. 7. Erroneous Charge.—A charge in this case upon the hypothesis that plaintiff was a trespasser upon the train, and engaged in a personal difficulty with the conductor, in a dispute about the payment of fare, presents a view of the case not raised by the evidence. Appeal from Angelina. Tried below before Hon. L. B. Hightower. The character of special charges 2, 3, and 4, asked by appellants, are indicated in head notes. Finlay, Marsh & Butler, for appellants. 1. The appellants having been finally discharged as receivers, and the property which came into their possession having been turned over by them to the persons specified in the order of the court providing for their discharge, no judgment could be rendered against them.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellant sued appellees, in trespass to try title, to recover parts of certain lots in the city of Houston, which formed a strip of land 30 feet wide by 150 feet long. The petition contained the usual averments of title in plaintiff, and in addition alleged, that defendants claimed under a deed for the land to one Klein, purporting to have been signed by herself and her former husband, M. J. Massie, in September, 1871, and denied under oath that she had ever signed or in any manner executed such deed, and charged that her signature thereto was a forgery, and that she believed that of her husband was also a forgery. Defendants relied on pleas of not guilty, and limitations of three, five, and ten years. It was shown at the trial, that the property at the date of the alleged deed to Klein was part of the homestead of appellant and her then husband, M. J. Massie. There was also evidence that it was the separate property of appellant by reason of its having been purchased with her means, though the deed was to her husband and put the legal title in him. Defendants relied on the following title, besides limitation: Deed from plaintiff and her husband to C. W. Klein, September, 1871, recorded July, 1891; deed from Klein to W. S. Dugat and J. B. Likens, June 6, 1876, recorded June 10, 1876; deed from Dugat and Likens to appellee Reynaud, under whom the other appellees claim, of June 7, 1877, recorded September 18,1878. The certificate of acknowledgment attached to the deed, purporting to be signed by Massie and wife, was in the usual form, except that it contained no statement that Mrs. Massie declared that she wished not to retract the deed, nor any equivalent words. The instrument in form was an absolute conveyance of the property in controversy, except that it recited payment of $200 of purchase money in cash, and retained a vendar’s lien to secure three notes for 850 each, given for the balance, the last note falling due December 1, 1871. Evidence was introduced by defendants, both direct and circumstantial, tending to prove the execution of the deed by both Massie and his wife. On the other hand, there was evidence in behalf of appellant that it was a forgery. When the instrument was offered in evidence by defendants, appellant objected to its admission because of the defective acknowledgment; and because it was an executory contract, and not sufficient to convey her separate property and defeat her homestead right; and because its execution had been denied under oath. The court admitted the deed, ruling that by her affirmative allegations attacking it as a forgery, appellant had put her right to recover upon that ground, and should be confined to it; and in the charge given to the jury, the right of appellant was made to depend on the issue as to the genuineness of her signature to the deed. That question was submitted to the jury upon the evidence, as was also the question of limitation, and they found a general verdict for defendants, stating specially that the deed was genuine. The evidence upon the issue of limitation showed conclusively, that appellees had held continuous possession of the land in controversy for more than twelve years prior to the institution of the suit, with an enclosure around it, using and enjoying it, openly and notoriously, as a part of the Reynaud homestead; that during all this time they have claimed and used it as their own, and in hostility to all others. The evidence in behalf of appellant on this issue does not raise any conflict which would authorize a jury to find in her favor. She testified on this point as follows: “ The strip of land in controversy in this suit was an alleyway, used by me before and after the death of my first husband in carrying wood and other things to the rear of our premises; myself and husband consented for Mr. Charles Klein to use said alleyway for like purposes in going to the rear of the premises. This alleyway was always a part of our homestead, and I never heard any one say that Mr. Massie had sold it. I never heard of it until I heard the deed above alluded to was filed for record. I allowed the defendants to use this alleyway, and never heard of their claiming a right to use it except by my consent until sometime about the year 1885. I returned from a visit, and found that defendants were erecting a house in front of this alleyway; I then had a fuss with them about it, but never could learn by what right they presumed to use it exclusively as their own.” This is all the evidence by which appellant, on the question of limitation, seeks to avoid the force of the specific facts, testified to by witness after witness, including her own children, that a fence was put around the property soon after the date of the deed to Klein, thus including it within the enclosure around the property constituting the homestead of Klein and afterwards of Reynaud; that this fence was replaced, in 1882, by a new one which Reynaud built; and from 1879, at the latest, until the institution of suit, the possession by appellees was notorious and unbroken, and must from its very nature have been known to appellant. Her statements above copied are not sufficient to rebut or even weaken the evidence in support of the adverse possession, and could not sustain a finding in her behalf if the case were reversed. We must conclude, therefore, that appellees have had more than ten years peaceable and adverse possession, use, and enjoyment of the premises sued for. There is no proof of payment of taxes. Our conclusions upon the law of the case are: 1. That the court did not err in admitting in evidence the instrument purporting to be a deed from Massie and wife to Klein. Its execution by Massie was sufficiently shown, and it was admissible as his deed for what it was worth. 2. But that deed was not sufficient to pass appellant’s title, the omission of the officer to state in his certificate of acknowledgment that Mrs. Massie declared that she wished not to retract the conveyance being fatal. Norton v. Davis, 83 Texas, 32. 3. We do not perceive that the petition restricts its denial to the fact that appellant had signed the deed. The statement is, that she had not signed nor in any manner executed it. The acknowledgment by a married woman is an essential part of her execution of a deed, and the language used in the pleading is broad enough to include a denial of such acknowledgment. Besides, we do not understand that this rule would be as the court below held it, even if the petition denied only the signing of the deed. The pleader is not there setting out specially his own title, but is attacking that of his adversary, by the allegation of a fact which he evidently supposed must be supported by affidavit, and therefore must be specially pleaded. This opinion may have been erroneous, but it is nevertheless true, that there is no purpose shown to restrict the issues to the question of the genuineness of the signature to the deed. The rule which confines a plaintiff in this action to proof of a title specially pleaded has no application. The charge of the court was therefore erroneous, wherein it confined plaintiff to the issue of forgery. The deed, even if genuine, was ineffectual to pass title to the homestead, and appellant would have been entitled to recover if defeated on no other ground. The special charges so declaring the law were true. 4. The fact that the deed retained a vendor’s lien did not bring it within the ruling in the case of Jones v. Goff, 63 Texas, 253. That case depended on a contract to convey at a future time. Here nothing was needed to complete title but the payment of the notes. There was no evidence that they had not been paid. None were produced, and it is evident, after this lapse of time, that if ever given, they had been paid. There was no error, therefore, in refusing appellant’s second special charge. 5. Nor should the court have given the special instructions numbers 1 and 5 asked by appellant, containing the proposition, that if appellant consented to the possession and use of the premises by defendants, they could not prescribe under the statutes of limitation. Consent of the owner of land to its occupancy by another does not of itself prevent such occupancy from being adverse, if the other essentials of an adverse holding appear. It is the absence of claim, or recognition of the true owner, on the part of the possessor, which prevents an occupancy which would otherwise be adverse from assuming that character. Such recognition does not necessarily result from an acquiescence in the use by the owner, but it is to be inferred from the conduct of the possessor. 6. It is unnecessary to decide whether or not the instruction given by the court and copied in the fourth assignment, as to the effect of abandonment of the homestead, was applicable to the case. 7. The evidence upon the issues of limitations was such as clearly entitled appellees to a verdict, and the result could not properly have been different had no error been committed. Appellant was barred by ten years limitation. The right judgment has been rendered, and the errors committed in the trial, inasmuch as the case must have been decided as it was, are immaterial. Affirmed. Delivered March 2, 1893.","FIRST DISTRICT, MARCH, 1893. Mary W. Murphy v. Oscar Reynaud et al. No. 107. 1. Limitation of Ten Years.—The evidence showed conclusively that appellees had held continuous possession of the land in controversy for more than twelve years prior to the institution of the suit, with an enclosure around it, using and enjoying it openly and notoriously. Appellant testified, that she and her husband consented for Mr. Klein (a former owner under whom appellees' claimed) to use the strip of land as an alley. SeM, consent of the owner of the land to its occupancy by another does not of itself prevent such occupancy from being adverse. It is the absence of claim, or the recognition of the true owner by the possessor, which prevents an occupancy otherwise adverse from assuming that character. 2. Deed Attacked for Forgery, When Admissible.—The acknowledgment did not show that Mrs. Massie, who purported to have signed it, declared “ that she wished not to retract it.” It was in form an absolute conveyance by husband and wife, but recited unpaid purchase money, and was attacked in plaintiff’s petition as a forgery. There was evidence tending to prove its execution by the husband, and it was sufficiently shown to render it admissible as his deed, for what it was worth. 3. Acknowledgment of Married Woman.—The omission of the officer to state in his certificate that the wife declared that she “ wished not to retract” the conveyance, was fatal to the deed. 4. Pleading—Special Allegations as to Defendant’s Title.—Plaintiff in her petition attacked one of the deeds in defendant's chain of title as a forgery, and declared that she had not signed nor in any manner executed it. The court below confined her right to recover to that ground alone. This was error. The pleader was not setting out specially her own title, but attacking her adversary’s. The rule which confines plaintiff to the special title pleaded had no application . 5. Executory and Executed Contract—That the deed retained a vend- or’s lien did not bring it within the ruling in Jones v. Goff, 63 Texas, 253. That case depended upon a contract to convey at a future time; here nothing was wanting to complete title but the payment of the notes, and there was no evidence that they had not been paid. Appeal from Harris. Tried below before Hon. James Masterson. F. F. Chew, for appellant. 1. The officer taking a married woman’s acknowledgment to the execution of a deed conveying her separate estate, must certify that she declared that she wished not to retract it, or to equivalent facts. Davis v. Agnew, 67 Texas, 210; Groesbeck v. Bodman, 73 Texas, 292; Williams v. Ellingsworth, 75 Texas, 481; Jones v. Goff, 63 Texas, 254. 2. The purported deed from plaintiff and husband to Klein, retaining as it did the vendor’s lien, was but the evidence of an executory contract by a married woman for the sale of a part of her homestead, and is absolutely void as to her, and therefore not admissible in evidence to show title in those claiming under same. McKelvain v. Allen, 58 Texas, 387; Jones v. Goff, 63 Texas, 253. No brief on file for appellees."
"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. This is the second appeal in this cause. On the former appeal the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded by the Supreme Court; and the case is reported on pages 375-379 of the 80tli volume of Texas Reports. The plaintiff, a corporation under the laws of Texas, by its amended original petition, complains of the New York and Texas Steamship Company, appellant here, a corporation owning and operating a line of steamships plying between the States of New York and Texas, a common carrier, that on the 21st day of July, 1888, a certain six-oared barge or gig was delivered to the appellant, consigned by Waters & Sons to the appellee; that said boat was received by the appellant in good order arid condition under its contract to deliver the same at Galveston, and thereupon a bill of lading was executed. That on the 1st day of August, 1888, said boat or gig arrived at Galveston on board one of the steamships •of appellant, and was tendered to appellee in a damaged condition, having been damaged through the negligence of the appellant. That said damaged condition being called to the attention of appellant and its agents, it and the said agents recognized the said damage, and admitted to plaintiff that the same was damaged, and had been damaged while in its custody, and recognized and admitted its responsibility and liability for said damage, and thereupon 'contracted and agreed with plaintiff that it, the said defendant, would replace said boat with a similar and perfect boat of the same character, size, make, and structure; and further promised, agreed, and contracted, that if it, the said defendant, did not so replace said boat or gig with a new and perfect boat or gig within a reasonable time thereafter, that it would pay the plaintiff the value of said boat so damaged as aforesaid, which agreement and promise plaintiff accepted and acquiesced in. The appellee then alleges, that defendant has become liable to pay plaintiff by said promise the value of the boat, or to replace the same by another boat as aforesaid, and that the said boat was of the value of $700; that defendant has failed and refused to comply with its contract, to the damage of plaintiff in the sum of $700. Defendant, by amended answer, demurred generally and specially to plaintiff’s petition, and among other special demurrers, to the effect that plaintiff’s ""petition failed to set up any consideration for the alleged paroi contract; answered by general denial, and specially denied the making of a paroi contract. The cause was tried before a jury, and the verdict was for plaintiff in the sum of $500, with 6 per cent interest from the 24th of March, 1889, on which verdict judgment was rendered for $578.08, to which judgment, a motion for new trial having been filed by the defendant and overruled-by the court, the defendant excepted, and in open court gave notice of appeal. From this statement of the plaintiff’s suit, it is seen that it is based solely upon the alleged special contract set out in the petition. The first assignment of error presented in appellant’s brief is, that the court erred in overruling defendant’s third special exception to plaintiff’s amended original petition. This exception assumes that the petition fails to set out any consideration for the alleged contract. To this assumption we-can not assent, and therefore hold that the court did not err in overruling the exception. The petition avers, that the plaintiff was the owner of a barge or gig shipped to it by the steamship of defendant, defendant being a common carrier between the city of New York and the city of Galveston, and while in the possession of defendant, and by its negligence, the gig was damaged, and that defendant recognized and.admitted the-liability to plaintiff, and promised and agreed with plaintiff as averred and set out in the petition. The appellant, upon the trial of the cause, offered to show by the testimony of several witnesses the financial condition of the plaintiff at the-time of the arrival of the barge or gig, after it had been repaired, for the purpose of showing that the real and true reason why plaintiff declined to accept the barge was not because it was not as good and valuable after it was repaired as it was before it was injured, but because plaintiff was-without money in its treasury to pay the price of the boat; and upon objection to this evidence by plaintiff, it was excluded by the court, and appellant excepted. But in none of its bills of exception to the exclusion of this evidence is the objection made by the plaintiff to the evidence given. We must therefore decline to consider these exceptions. Under such circumstances, every presumption is in favor of the correctness of the ruling of the court. Railway v. Gage. 63 Texas, 568. For the like reason, we decline to consider the exceptions of appellant to the exclusion of testimony offered to show that the defendant was instructed by the manufacturer and vendor of the barge not to deliver same until plaintiff paid both the price of that boat and the price of another ordered by plaintiff, and held by the manufacturer for shipment to plaintiff; and of testimony tending to show plaintiff’s willingness to accept the barge after it had been repaired, upon condition that the vendor would accept the money advanced by plaintiff to him as a payment upon the repaired boat, and relieve plaintiff from obligation to take the other boat ordered by it. We do not think the court erred in sustaining exceptions to questions propounded to witness Hodges, with the view of showing the actual cost of the boat. There was nothing in the pleadings to authorize the introduction of such evidence; the plaintiff sued to recover on an alleged contract, by which defendant undertook and promised to deliver to plaintiff “another boat of same character, size, make, and structure,” or to pay the value of the boat injured by defendant; and because there may have been conflict in the testimony of plaintiff’s witnesses, the defendant could not introduce evidence to establish another and different contract than the one alleged by plaintiff, unless defendant had itself alleged the contract to be such as it proposed to prove. Besides, the bill of exceptions taken to the exclusion of this evidence has the same vice as the other bills referred to above; it does not state the objections made to the evidence by the plaintiff. We do not think the court erred in refusing the first and the fourth special charges requested by appellant, for the reason that they were not applicable to the case made by the pleadings and the evidence. The second charge requested by defendant, and refused by the court, might have been properly given; but its refusal was harmless error, inasmuch as the rejected charge was substantially given in the court’s charge. The charge given by the court is not, in our opinion, subject to the ■criticisms embraced under the appellant’s eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-first assignments. The charge of the court stated the contract alleged by plaintiff to have been made with it by defendant, and the jury were expressly told, unless they believed from the evidence that the 1 ‘ aforesaid alleged contract and agreement was entered into by and between the parties through their agents,” the plaintiff should not recover, and the verdict should be for the defendant. If the charge was defective in the particular specified under the twenty-second assignment of error, the appellant should have sought, by asking an appropriate charge, to have the defect cured. While there is some conflict in the evidence as to what was the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, our conclusion is, that the weight of the evidence upon this issue is with the plaintiff. We have thoughtfully examined the records of this case, and finding no error which would authorize a reversal of the judgment of the lower court, it must be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 2, 1893.","The New York and Texas Steamship Company v. The Island City Boating and Athletic Association. No. 96. 1. Contract—Consideration.—Appellee having ordered a boat which was shipped by appellant's steamship line, found when it arrived at Galveston that it was seriously damaged, and refused to receive it; whereupon appellant agreed with appellee, that if it did not replace the boat with a new or perfect one within a reasonable time, it would pay plaintiff the value of the damaged boat. The facts alleged show a good consideration for the special contract sued on. 2. Bills of Exception must show the objection made to the evidence admitted or excluded. Every presumption is in favor of the correctness of the ruling of the court below. 3. Evidence—Irrelevant.—Evidence of cost of the boat was properly excluded. There was nothing in the pleadings to authorize the introduction of such evidence. The defendant could not introduce evidence of another and different contract than the one alleged by plaintiff, unless it had itself alleged it. 4. Charge.—When a rejected charge, though proper, was substantially given in the charge of the court, the rejection is harmless error. 5. Defective Charge, How Corrected.—If the charge was defective in the particular specified, the appellant should have sought to have the error cured by asking an appropriate charge.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. On the 1st day of May, 1886, H. C. Morrow leased to A. C. Buck a certain pasture in Wise County for a term of five years, commencing with that date, for the sum of $125 per year, with the provision, that after the second year, should Morrow have occasion to sell the land, he should compensate Buck for any or all losses occasioned by the sale. It was understood between the parties at the time that the land was being leased by Buck to graze cattle thereon. At the expiration of two years the land was sold and appellant Buck dispossessed. He offered to prove on the trial by the witness J. L. Campbell, that at the time he was dispossessed he had 140 head of cattle in the pasture, under the charge and control of said Campbell, and that he and Campbell had made diligent inquiry and search for another pasture for the cattle, but failed to find one. That said cattle were turned out of the pasture on the commons, and ran at large on the range for a period of five months before another could be procured. That during the time the cattle were on the range, it required an extra hand to look after and keep them rounded up, at a cost of 81.50 per day, which was a reasonable charge. That all reasonable diligence was used to prevent said cattle from straying off; but during said time fifteen of them were lost, reasonably worth 815 per head, and after diligent search could not be found. Further evidence was offered as to the expense of pasturing the cattle in another pasture, thereafter procured. This testimony was all excluded, on the ground that it was immaterial, the measure of damages being the difference, if any, between the contract price and the rental value of the pasture for the unexpired term. The rule followed by the trial court in excluding this evidence is, undoubtedly the correct rule for measuring the general damages incident to the breach of a covenant for quiet enjoyment in a lease. In addition to the difference between the rent to be paid and the actual value of the unexpired term, the tenant may also recover as special damages such extra expense and damage, if any, as are the natural and proximate result of the breach. 1 Woods’ Landl. and Ten., sec. 362; 1 Taylor’s Landl. and Ten., sec. 317; 3 Suth. on Dam., 149-159. The rule which confines the general damage to the difference between the rental value and the stipulated rent seems to rest upon the assumption that the tenant can go at once into the market and obtain like property. Addison v. Chandler, 11 Mich., 542. Where the reason of the rule does not exist, it would seem that the rule itself should not apply, to the exclusion of all other considerations in estimating the damages. Special damages, in addition, have been allowed in many instances. Giles v. O’Toole, 4 Barb., 261; Gilley v. Hawkins, 48 Ill., 308; Shaw v. Hoffman, 25 Mich., 162; Rickett v. Lostetter, 19 Ind., 125. It was held in De la Zerda v. Korn, 25 Texas Supp., 194, that injury to the tenant’s goods or stock in trade, in addition to the value of the use and occupation of the premises, should be considered in estimating the damages. Whatever special damage naturally and proximately resulted to appellant from the sale of the land and termination of the lease—whatever may reasonably be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties at the time of the contract—he should recover. The items of expense which he sought to prove for pasturage elsewhere, we think, should be included in the general damages, measured by the difference between the market value of the residue of the term and the contract price, and that that part of the evidence was perhaps properly excluded. As to the extra expense and loss incident to a temporary holding of his cattle on the commons, pending a diligent effort to secure another pasture, if the proof should show that these items were the proximate result of the sale of the land and termination at.that time of the lease, and that thereby a loss was sustained which otherwise would not have occurred, and that it was not the result of the want of proper care and diligence on the part of appellant, we think he would be entitled to recover the amount of loss thus sustained as special damages. As to what is the proximate cause of an injury, is ordinarily a question for the jury (61 Texas, 353); and we think the court erred in excluding from their consideration all evidence of special damage growing out of the fact that appellant was forced for a time to hold his cattle upon the commons. It may be that upon another trial, with full proof, he would not be entitled to recover anything in the way of special damages; but, talcing all the statements in the bill of exceptions to be true, we are of opinion that the evidence should have gone to the jury. The law provides no such cast-iron rule for measuring damages as the bill of exceptions indicates was invoked to exclude this evidence. On the other hand, the promise of appellee to pay any or all losses occasioned by the sale ” does not authorize the latitude of recovery for which appellant seems to contend in his brief. Damages allowable on express agreements for indemnity can only be such as naturally and proximately proceed from the cause referred to in the indemnity. 2 Suth. on Dam., 604. For the error in excluding all testimony except as to the difference between the contract price and the value of the unexpired term, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded Delivered February 16, 1893. Justice Head did not sit in this case.","A. C. Buck v. H. C. Morrow. No. 88. 1. Lease Contract—Measure of Damages for Dispossessing Tenant.—Where the landlord dispossesses the tenant before the expiration of the lease, the measure of damages is not confined to the difference between the contract price and the rental value of the premises for the unexpired term; but, in addition, the tenant may also recover as special damages such extra expense and loss as may have naturally and proximately resulted from his being deprived of the use of the premises. 2. Same—Special Damages.—The lessee of a pasture who is deprived of its use by the lessor before expiration of the lease, may recover as'special damages the expenses and losses sustained in holding his cattle on the commons pending a diligent effort to secure another pasture, if there has been no want of care on his part. 3. Same —Damages Must Result Proximately.—A stipulation in a lease contract, that if the landlord should sell the premises before the expiration, of the term he would pay the tenant for “ any and all losses occasioned by the-sale,” will authorize the recovery of only such damages as naturally and proximately proceed from the cause referred to in such stipulation of indemnity. Appeal from Grayson. Tried below before Hon. P. B. Muse. E. F. Brown, for appellant. The contract of lease is to be looked to-in determining the measure of damages as between the parties thereto, and all damages which may reasonably be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties at the time of making the contract, as the probable result of a breach thereof, will form the measure of damages-in the particular case.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. The appellants Leon & H. Blum, as creditors of J. H. Brodie & Co., sued out a writ of attachment from the District Court of Comanche County, which was levied by the appellant T. E. Wilson, sheriff of Comanche County, upon a stock of merchandise in the possession of the appellee, W. R. Bratton, who claimed the same as assignee of the firm of J. H. Brodie & Co. Appellee brought suit against the appellants for the conversion of the said stock of merchandise. Trial was before the court without a jury. There was a judgment in favor of the appellee for $1881.56, from which judgment appellants prosecute this appeal. We find the facts to be as follows: 1. That J. H. Brodie & Co., a firm composed of J. H. Brodie and W. B. Brodie, was before the 1st day of October, 1889, engaged in the mercantile business in Comanche, Texas. 2. That said firm was on the 1st day of October, 1889. insolvent, and that upon that day the firm, through W. B. Brodie, made and delivered to appellee the following deed of assignment, to-wit: ''■The State of Texas, County of Comanche.—This indenture, made this 1st day of October, A. D. 1889, by and between J. H. Brodie & Co. and W. R. Bratton, all of Comanche County, witnesseth: That whereas the said J. H. Brodie & Co. are jointly indebted in divers sums of money, which they are unable to pay in full, to different creditors, whose names are stated in the annexed list, and they desire to make a fair distribution of their property and assets among those of their creditors who will consent to accept their proportional share of their estate and discharge them from their respective claims in accordance with the statute. “Now therefore, in consideration of the premises and of the sum of one dollar to them in hand paid by the said W. R. Bratton, the said J. H. Brodie & Co. do by these presents bargain, sell, convey, release, and set over unto the said W. R. Bratton all their real and personal estate, other than that which is by law exempted from execution, to have and to hold, unto him, the said W. R. Bratton and his successors, in trust for the benefit of the creditors of the said J. H. Brodie & Co. as aforesaid. And the said W. R. Bratton on his part covenants and agrees to faithfully perform his duties as assignee in accordance with the statute concerning assignments for the benefit of creditors. “ In testimony whereof, witness our hands, October 1, 1889. “ J. H. Brodie & Co., 6* By W. B. Brodie.” This assignment was duly and properly acknowledged on the 1st day of October, 1889, by the said W. B. Brodie for the firm of J. H. Brodie & Co., before a notary public of Comanche County, Texas. 3. That at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed of assignment, and before that time, J. H. Brodie was an absconding debtor, and left the stock of merchandise of the firm in the possession of W. B. Brodie. 4. That W. B. Brodie had paroi consent from J. H. Brodie to execute the deed of assignment. 5. That J. H. Brodie, at the time of the execution and the delivery of the deed of assignment, had no other property than his interest in the firm of J. H. Brodie & Co. 6. It appears that the property of J. H. Brodie & Co. is a stock of merchandise and accounts, etc., and is wholly personal property. 7. That W. R. Bratton, appellee, duly and legally qualified as assignee under such deed of. assignment, and that J. H. Brodie filed, as required by law, a list and schedule of the creditors and inventory and assets of the property and estate of J. H. Brodie & Co., and the same were duly recorded, etc. 8. That appellants have a valid debt against J. H. Brodie & Co. in the amount of $3325.97, and that suit was filed on said debt in the District Court of Comanche County, and that an attachment was issued and levied on the goods transferred by the deed of assignment by the appellants. 9. That the value of the goods levied upon by the writ of attachment is the sum of $1881.56. Objections were made in the court below to the evidence of witnesses Hamilton, W. B. Brodie, and Cunningham, as to certain statements made by J. II. Brodie before he left Comanche, and before the assignment was made, tending to show his purpose to be to make an assignment of the property of J. H. Brodie & Co., and also tending to show that he authorized W. B. Brodie to execute the assignment. Objection is also made to evidence showing that J. H. Brodie had no property other than his interest in the firm assets. Without entering into a discussion of this question and giving our reasons in full, we hold that the evidence objected to was admissible. Coffin v. Douglass, 61 Texas, 406; McKee v. Coffin, 66 Texas, 307. The next question raised is, that paroi authority given by J. H. Brodie was not sufficient to authorize W. B. Brodie to execute the assignment so as to bind the members of the firm. The evidence shows, that the assets of the firm are personal property, and that J. H. Brodie owned no other property, and that he authorized his partner, W. B. Brodie, to make the assignment if he did not hear from him by a certain day. Failing to hear from J. H. Brodie within the time agreed, W. B. Brodie executed the deed of assignment. These facts sufficiently authorized W. B. Brodie to execute the assignment, and it is binding upon him as well as J. H. Brodie. McKee v. Coffin, 66 Texas, 307. The next question to be considered is, Does the deed of assignment pass the individual property of the partners as well as the assets of the firm ? We think it does. The terms employed in the instrument are in many respects similar to those passed upon in the cases of Shoe Company v. Ferrell, 68 Texas, 638; Coffin v. Douglass, 61 Texas, 406; and Mc-Guffin v. Sowell, 1 Texas Civil Appeals, 187. The court in those cases holds, that the instruments are sufficient to pass the individual property of the members of the firm as well as the firm property. We find no error in the record, and affirm the judgment. Affirmed. Delivered January 18, 1893.","Leon & H. Blum v. W. R. Bratton. No. 64. 1. Assignment by Firm made by One Member—An assignment for the benefit of accepting creditors, executed in name of a firm by one of its members, was attacked by creditors. Held, that paroi testimony was competent and relevant, tending to show that the member of the firm other than the one signing the conveyance intended to make an assignment, that he authorized the execution, and that he had no property other than his interest in the firm assets. 2 Same.—See facts held sufficient to show the authority of one member of a firm to execute an assignment of the firm assets. 3.

Cases Adhered to.—Coffin v. Douglas, 61 Texas, 406, and Shoe Company v. Ferrell, 68 Texas, 638, adhered to, as to assignments. Appeal from Comanche. Tried below before Hon. T. H. Conner. Scott, Levi & Smith and Lindsey & Hutchison, for appellants. 1. The evidence, the admission of which is complained of, if competent at all, was only to show that W. B. Brodie was authorized by J. H. Brodie to execute an assignment for the latter, and for that purpose it was wholly inadmissible, because there was no allegation that any such authority was granted, or that the assignment was executed in pursuance thereof. 2. The said testimony was inadmissible for any other purpose, because for any other purpose it was, as to the appellants, purely hearsay, and related to matters that were res inter alios acta. 3. The said testimony was further inadmissible, because even if the authority which it undertook to show had been alleged, it was incompetent' to prove by paroi a paroi authority to execute an assignment, which does not purport to be executed by any such authority, and which the law requires should be subscribed and acknowledged by the grantors therein, or some one by them thereunto authorized, and after being so subscribed, duly authenticated for record as in cases of deeds. Act of March 24, 1879. 4. The deed of assignment, which stipulates for a release from the creditors accepting thereunder, and which is not signed by all of the assignors, is void as to creditors, and can not be validated by showing that the assignor who did not sign had no individual estate; and evidence to show that he had no such estate is not admissible. The deed of assign-' ment is void on its face, and can not be cured by any such evidence. Burr, on Ass., see. 197. 5. Tested by and considered in relation either to our statute on assignments or the common law, the assignment under consideration is void as to appellants, for that it stipulates for a release of the firm and its members by accepting creditors, and yet was executed only by one of the two members of the firm. That the assignment is not good under the statute: Donoho v. Fish Bros., 58 Texas, 168; Still v. Focke, 66 Texas, 715; Cleveland v. Battle, 68 Texas, 111; Baylor County v. Craig, 69 Texas, 330; Burr. on Ass., sec. 197. That a general assignment executed by less than all the members of the assigning firm is not as a general rule valid at common law: Burr, on Ass., ch. 4, see. 68, et seq. The exception to the rule, which permits an assignment by only a portion of the members under certain circumstances, is not of universal force and is a much mooted question. Burr, on Ass., ch. 4, sec. 68, et seq. An assignment, even by all the partners, which stipulates for a release, is of very doubtful validity at common law, and the best authorities and the strongest reasons are against their enforcement. Burr, on Ass., ch. 11. ' Hamilton & Presler, for appellee. 1. One partner may make a valid assignment under the statute in this State. When the other partner has abandoned the business and absconded, or when the partner not signing has consented to the execution of the assignment, such assent may be inferred from the circumstances. Such consent and authority may be given by paroi, and paroi proof thereof is admissible, even when the deed of assignment confines the benefit thereof to and exacts a release from consenting creditors. McKee v. Coffin, 66 Texas, 307; Coffin v. Douglass, 61 Texas, 406; Bump. on Fraud. Con., 355, 546; Eng. and Am. Encycl. of Law, 849 (note 3 and cases cited), 850 (note 1); Sullivan v. Smith, 15 Neb., 476. 2. The deed of assignment, signed and executed by one member of a copartnership in the firm name, and acting with the authority and consent of the other partner and at his special direction so to do, is valid. Notwithstanding the deed stipulates for a release from accepting creditors, the act of the agent, under such circumstances, becomes the act of the principal, and the deed is in legal contemplation executed by both members of the copartnership, and the firm signature becomes tantamount and equivalent to the individual signatures of partners composing the firm; and if the terms of the deed will admit of such construction, it will be construed to pass to the assignee the title both to the firm property and that property not by law exempt, belonging to the copartners as individuals. McKee v. Coffin, 66 Texas, 308; Coffin v. Douglass, 61 Texas, 407. As to firm signature instead of that of individuals: Donoho v. Fish Bros., 58 Texas, 164; Keating v. Vaughn, 61 Texas, 518."
"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. From the conclusions of fact, which we adopt, there being no statement of facts, it appears, that in the year 1890 appellee made application to purchase a section of school land in Fisher County as an actual settler, the land being classed as agricultural, and accompanied his application with the affidavit, as provided in the Act of 1887, that he had settled on the land. A similar proceeding had been inaugurated in the name of his mother in 1888, who thereafter, joined by her husband, transferred her claim to him. These applications, accompanied with the proper obligations, were accepted in succession by the Commissioner of the Land Office, and the required payments of interest were duly made. Neither of said parties had at tlie dates of these applications, or at any other time, settled on the land, but were then, as well as up to the time of the trial, living on section 58, seven miles from the land in question. After these applications had been made, appellant went into the actual possession of the land and settled upon it in good faith, as provided in the Act of 1887; and in August, 1890, forwarded to the General Land Office his application, affidavit, obligation, and partial payment, as required by said Act of 1887, to purchase the land as an actual settler, which were refused by the Commissioner of the General Land Office. Thereafter this suit was brought to dispossess him; and though the court found that he was an actual settler in good faith at the time of the trial, and had been since the 19th day of July, 1890, judgment was entered in favor of appellee, from which this appeal is prosecuted. In the case of Metzler v. Johnson [1 Texas Civil Appeals, 137], the question here submitted was passed upon. In addition to what is there said, we will only add, that according to our construction of the Act of 1887, providing for the sale of lands set apart for the benefit of the public free school fund, as the land was not subject to sale in the absence of an actual settler, the Commissioner had no power to accept a purchaser for the land in controversy so long as it remained vacant and unoccupied. The condition did not obtain which authorized him to act until appellant settled upon the land. Under a law empowering the Commissioner to issue a duplicate certificate for land where the original has been lost or destroyed, it has been decided that his power to issue the duplicate rests upon the fact that an original certificate once existed, and not upon the evidence of its original existence and loss; and hence that a duplicate issued where no original ever existed confers no right whatever. Gunter & Munson v. Meade & Bomar, 78 Texas, 638. The affidavit of appellee, as required by section 9 of the Act of 1887, that he had in good faith settled on the land, when in fact he had not, did not empower the Commissioner to sell the land to him or anybody else, because, as provided, in effect, in section 5, the land was not subject to sale until there was in fact an actual settler on it. The judgment will be reversed and here rendered for appellant. Reversed and rendered. Delivered March 9, 1893.","William E. Hitson v. Walter A. Glascock. No. 120.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This suit was brought by appellee against appellant, to recover damages for personal injuries, and resulted in a verdict and judgment for appellee, from which the appellant has prosecuted this appeal. Appellee was employed as a brakeman by appellant. While coupling cars in the discharge of Ms duty his hand was mashed and his thumb injured. The cars were not the property of appellant, but belonged to a connecting line. There was a defect in the cars, which was the cause of the injury. The jury found that the company had failed, through its inspector, to use due care in inspecting the cars and in providing against the danger incident to handling them. The appellant contended, and here contends, that because of the fact that the cars were foreign cars the company did not owe the same measure of diligence in guarding against defects as if they had been its property. Appellant also contended, and here insists, that because of this fact the inspector and appellee were fellow servants, and that for this reason the negligence of the former should be imputed to the latter. Appellant asked special instructions covering these defenses, which were refused by the court. This refusal is assigned as error. Delivered October 25, 1892. The action of the court is sustained by us. Our Supreme Court has held, correctly, we think, that a railway company is under the same obligation to furnish safe appliances for the use of its employes, whether the cars belong to it or to a connecting line, and that the doctrine applying to fellow servants does not obtain under the circumstances here stated. Railway v. Kernan, 78 Texas, 294. The judgment is therefore affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Head did not sit in this case.","Saint Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company v. R. L. Putnam. No. 14. Damages— Fellow Servants— Foreign Cars. — A railway company is under the same obligation to furnish safe appliances for the use of its employes, whether the cars belong to it or to a connecting line; and where a brakeman receives an injury by reason of defect in a car and the negligence of the car inspector, the doctrine of fellow servants does not obtain; and the rule is not changed because the car is a foreign car, belonging to a connecting line, and being transported as such. , Appeal from Grayson. Tried below before Hon. H. 0. Head. The opinion gives a statement of the case. Bryant & Dillard, for appellant. The cars were received from a foreign road and were used in through traffic, and the inspector of such cars was, as to plaintiff, a fellow servant; and if an injury arose through his failure to properly inspect the cars, plaintiff would have no right to recover therefor. The law compels a railway company to receive and transport cars tendered to it by a connecting line. Kelley v. Abbott, 48 Wis., 308; Baldwin v. Railway, 50 Iowa, 680; Foley v.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. This is a suit by appellants as the independent executors of the will of W. R. Baker, deceased, of trespass to try title, against Mrs. Isa R. De Freese, for lots 9, 10, and adjacent halves of 11 and 8 in block 277, on the south side of Buffalo Bayou in the city of Houston. The defendant answered by a plea of not guilty, and that on July 14, 1881, W. R. Baker bought the lots in controversy in his own name, but actually in trust for defendant, and in pursuance of same gave the lots to her, and immediately constructed on the lots for her a dwelling house and other improvements, which he also gave and donated to her, and about October 10, 1882, in pursuance of said purchase and trust, and to perfect the gift, he put defendant in the full and actual possession of the property as her own, and vested the same in her in fee simple forever; and she has ever since that date to the present had and retained the actual, adverse, and exclusive possession of it, with his full knowledge that she was claiming and holding it as her own, and adversely to him; and that on the faith of this gift, and on the faith and belief that the property was hers, she had, after she was put in possession, and during W. R. Baker’s life and with his knowledge, made permanent and valuable improvements upon it, at a cost and to the value of $5000, and has for eight years devoted her whole time, care, and attention to the repairing and preservation of the property to the value of $500 per year; that she would not have done this, or improved the property, had she not believed it hers; and that Mr. Baker during his life always recognized the property as hers, and made no claim to it, although he saw her improving it as her own, and knew she so claimed it. She pleaded estoppel by reason of the facts set up. and prays enforcement of the gift, and to be quieted in her title and possession. By a supplemental petition, plaintiffs denied the gift, and pleaded that Mr. Baker bought the lots and erected thereon a commodious residence, with all necessary out-houses, fences, etc., all of which he paid for, and that he did so for the purpose of the defendant occupying the same during his pleasure; that he studiously refrained from any act that would divest him of the title to said property; that he assessed and paid taxes on the same, in his own name, from date of purchase to his death; that he insured the improvements in his own name; that if the defendant placed any improvements on said lots, they were of little value; that the rental value of the property was $40 per month, and far exceeded the value of any improvements; and that during all the time that defendant occupied” said premises W. R. Baker gave to her monthly the sum of $150, which more than compensated defendant for the value of any improvements, and for any service rendered by her in preserving and improving the premises. To this the defendant, by supplemental answer, replied, that if Mr. Baker assessed and paid taxes on the property or insured it, he did so for her. That it was his habit and custom to take charge of the property of his sister and of this defendant, and to assess and insure same in his own name, and his doing so was not for the purpose of claiming it as his own. That in 1879 she was living in Grimes County, in her home, on a small farm, on which she was able to make a support for herself and her minor children; that she was the youngest and only sister of Mrs. Hester E. Baker, the wife of W. R. Baker, and they (Mrs. Baker and W. R. Baker) induced her in 1879 to leave her farm in Grimes County and come to Houston, to be and live near her sister, upon their expressed promise and stipulation that he (Baker) would give and donate her a house and lots for a home in Houston, and would assist her besides to support herself and her children. That he was a man of large wealth, and knowing that it would be no imposition on him, she left her home in Grimes County and moved to Houston, in reliance upon the said promise, which he (Baker) fulfilled, by giving her this property, and by assisting her with money to support herself and her children; that her improvements made upon and her care of the property have greatly enhanced its value, and that it would be now inequitable and unjust to permit Mr. Baker’s executors to maintain a claim against her which he himself never thought of asserting; that it would damage her irreparably, and leave her homeless and penniless. The case was tried by a jury, and a verdict and judgment rendered for the defendant, and the case comes here on appeal from that judgment by plaintiffs in the court below. From this statement of the nature of the plaintiff’s suit, and the answers of the defendant, it will be seen, that the defense relied on is a paroi sale or donation, with part performance thereof, from the plaintiffs’ testator to the defendant. What constitutes part performance of a paroi sale or gift of land, and such as will relieve the purchaser or donee from the operation of that section of the statute of frauds which requires every sale or gift of land to be evidenced by writing, has long been a vexed question. By many of the most eminent jurists and judges of this country it has been held, that if the purchaser or donee was placed in possession of the premises by the vendor or donor, or if possession was taken with his knowledge and consent, under an expressed promise from him to convey the property, such naked possession constituted part performance of the contract, and would take the sale or gift out of the operation of the statute, and the purchaser or donee might compel the owner to convey title, by deed, to the property; otherwise, the owner, by repudiating his promise, might subject the occupant of the land to damages for trespass. By other courts it has been held, that mere possession of the premises is not sufficient to avoid the statute, but that the possession must be coupled with the erection of valuable and permanent improvements upon the property by the vendee or donee. And still other courts have held, that though possession be taken under a paroi contract or promise to convey, and the occupant, relying upon such promise, and with the knowledge and consent of the promisor, makes valuable and permanent improvements upon the land, yet if the rents and profits of the premises exceed the value of the improvements, the vendor or donor can not be compelled to execute his contract. The Supreme Court of this State, it would seem, has given its assent to this latter doctrine in the cases of Ann Berta Lodge v. Leverton, 42 Texas, 18; Eason v. Eason, 61 Texas, 227; Wooldridge v. Hancock, 70 Texas, 18; and perhaps in others. But in the case of Murphy v. Stell, 43 Texas, 135, the court holds, the same judge delivering the opinion in that case and the opinion in the case of Ann Berta Lodge v. Leverton, that possession, and permanent and valuable improvements, made with the consent of the vendor, and in reliance upon his promise to convey, are sufficient to give title and to enforce specific performance of the paroi agreement to convey the land. To permit the donor, says the court, to recover the land from his son, to whom he had given it, after the son, relying upon the promise of the father to convey the land to him, had, with the knowledge and consent of the father, erected permanent and valuable improvements upon the premises, would be to sanction a fraud. Nothing whatever is said in the opinion about the rents and profits of the land during the son’s possession. In the ease of Wells et al. v. Davis, 77 Texas, 636, the plaintiff Wells brought suit against the defendant, Mrs. Nellie Davis, to recover a house and two adjoining lots in the city of Sherman. Defendant by her answer averred, that in 1882 W. W. Walker, from whom plaintiff purchased, donated to her the lots in controversy and placed her in possession of same, and that relying on his promise to make her a deed, she had, with Ms knowledge and without objection from him, placed valuable and permanent improvements on the lots, and that she had occupied the premises as the homestead of herself and family from the date of the alleged donation. Walker, who was a party to this suit, denied that he had made a gift of the property to defendant; and averred that defendant was indebted to him in large sums of money advanced to her' and for her account, and for the rent of the premises; and averred that the rental value of the lots was in excess of the value of the improvements. Upon the trial the evidence showed, that the rents of the premises, from the date of the alleged donation to the date of sale by Walker to Wells, were, as averred by Walker, in excess of the improvements made by the defendant. The jury was charged in accordance with the rule announced in Eason v. Eason, Wooldridge v. Hancock, and Bradley v. Owsley; and verdict and judgment were rendered for defendant; from which the plaintiff appealed, and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court. Judge Henry, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: “ When the owner of land has given it to another, or when he has sold it and the| purchase money has been paid, and the vendee or donee has been placed in possession, and has in consequence thereof placed upon the land improvements of a character that a court of equity will estimate as being within themselves of sufficient importance and value to entitle the party to a decree for the specific performance of the contract, the use of the premises from the date of such possession must be treated as going with the equitable right of the property itself. In this case, the amount expended in the improvement of the land, compared to the value of the land itself, can not be treated as unimportant. The circumstances under which the improvements were made must be considered. Possession of the property as a homestead was retained by the donee for several years without objection. Under the terms of the gift, she had assurance that her possession of the property was to be permanent, and that her title to the property was to be made perfect. She was justified in believing that she was its owner, and not a renter. It would be a wrong to her to treat, under such circumstances, improvements placed on the property for the permanent enhancement of its comfort and value as mere offsets against the rents, to be applied whenever the holder of the legal title might see proper to eject her. We think the charge of the court was more favorable to the plaintiff than he had a right to demand, under the circumstances of this case.” Under this state of the decisions of the Supreme Court of this State, this court feels at liberty to reject the rule, which would seem to require that in every case of paroi sale or gift of land in which the vendee seeks to recover, upon the ground of possession and permanent and valuable improvements made in reliance upon the promise of the vendor or donor, and with his consent, the rental value of the premises must be set off against the value of the improvements, regardless of their nature and their relative value to that of the land; and to follow a rule, in our opinion, more in consonance with the principles of equity, and which is more nearly in line with the consensus of judicial opinions of the present day. We hold, therefore, that when a paroi sale or donation is made, and the vendee or donee goes in possession of the land with the consent of the vendor or donor, and in reliance upon the contract or promise of the vendor or donor, and with his knowledge and without objections from him, makes permanent and valuable improvements upon the land, and of value in reasonable proportion to that of the premises so improved, and occupies the same as his home, in a suit for specific performance by his donee or vendee, the vendor or donor can not set off the rental value of the premises against the improvement; and the vendee or donee under such circumstances must be held and treated as the equitable owner of the land, and can not be considered as the tenant of the holder of the legal title. Wells v. Davis, 77 Texas, 637; Pome, on Spec. Perf., secs. 126-129, and case cited in the notes to said sections; Young v. Denning, 6 Watts, 509. Applying this rule to the case now under consideration, the judgment must be affirmed. The evidence establishes conclusively, that the premises were donated to defendant by the plaintiffs’ testator in 1882; that she was at that time placed in possession by the donor, and that she had continued to occupy the premises ever since as a home for herself and children; that prior to the year 1879, she was living in Grimes County, upon a small farm owned by her, and that the said Baker, who was the husband of defendant’s only sister, and who was much attached to the defendant, persuaded her to abandon her home in Grimes County, and to come to Houston to live, assuring defendant that he would not only give her a home, but would assist her in supporting her children; and that in fulfillment of this promise, the said Baker purchased the lots in question for her in 1881, and in 1882 constructed a comfortable dwelling upon the same, and placed defendant in possession of the same, and donated both the lots and improvements thereon to her; and that the said Baber always afterwards regarded the place as property of defendant, and so declared to many persons on various occasions, and made such declarations within a few days of his death, whichvoccurred in 1890; that after defendant took possession of the property, Baker was often at her house up to the time of his death; that he treated defendant with great kindness and liberality; that being a man of large means, he contributed monthly to the support of herself and children the sum of §75; that believing that she was the owner of the place, defendant, with full knowledge of Baker, and without objection from him, made large improvements upon the place of a permanent and valuable character, and which enhanced both the value and the comfort of the premises; such as raising the lots so as to protect them from overflow, building chimneys and out-houses, improving the sidewalks, and planting shrubbery and shade trees, besides other and less valuable improvements, as rebuilding the cisterns, repainting the house, and repairing the water mains. It was also proved, that these improvements were not made with the money given defendant by Baker, but with her own means, and such as were furnished by her sons. The original cost of the lots and the house erected by Baker was shown to be about $5000. The improvements-placed upon the premises were estimated to be worth $2500. This estimate was not contradicted, and was the only evidence offered as to the value of the improvements. The plaintiffs offered evidence as to the rental value of the premises. The evidence on this subject, taken most favorably for appellants, shows that the value of the improvements were somewhat in excess of the rents. Plaintiffs also proved, that Baker was a careful and methodical business man, and that the property in litigation was insured by Baker, and was described as “ occupied by a tenant;” and further, that it was assessed in the name of Baker, and that the taxes-were paid by him. Under these circumstances it would, in our judgment, inflict a wrong upon the defendant to permit the plaintiffs to recover the lands, and a court of equity could not have rendered a judgment for the plaintiffs. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the assignments of error upon the giving and refusal of charges by the court; it is immaterial what charges were given or what were refused. Eason v. Eason, 61 Texas; Teal v. Terrell, 58 Texas, 257; and Mitchell v. De Witt, 20 Texas, 294. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 9, 1893.","W. R. Baker’s Executors v. Isa R. De Freese. No. 111. 1. Parol Gift of Realty.—W. R. Baker, a man of wealth, in 1882, by paroi, gave to the sister of his wife realty in Houston worth $5000, and placed her in possession, and she lived there until Baker’s death, he contributing during said time $75 per month to her support. Baker made frequent declarations up to his death that he regarded the property as defendant’s, was often at her house, and treated her with great kindness and liberality. Defendant gave up her home in Grimes County and came to Houston to live at the request of Baker, and during her residence on the property made improvements of the value of $2500 upon it. Baker paid the taxes in his own name, rendered it as occupied by a tenant, insured the property himself, and the rental value of the property was a little less than the value of the improvements. The paroi donation was sustained. 2. Parol Sale or Gift—Part Performance. — What constitutes such part performance of a paroi sale or gift of land as will relieve the donee from the operation of that section of the statute of frauds which requires such sale or gift to be evidenced by writing, has long been a vexed question! We hold that when a paroi sale or donation is made, and the vendee or donee goes in possession of the land, with the consent of the vendor or donor, and in reliance upon'the contract or promise of the vendor or donor, and with his knowledge, and without objection from him, makes permanent and valuable improvements upon the land, and of value in reasonable proportion to that of the premises so improved, and occupies the same as his home, in a suit for specific performance by his donee or vendee the vendor or donor can not set off the rental value of the premises against the improvements; and the vendee or donee, under such circumstances, must be held and treated as the equitable owner of the land, and can not be considered as the tenant of the holder of the legal title. Appeal from Harris. Tried below before Hon. James Masterson. E. P. Hamblen, for appellants. Only when necessary to prevent fraud will equity decree a specific performance of a paroi gift of land. If the appellees were compensated for the repairs and improvements they made by the rents, or if such improvements were made by them with money contributed by Mr. Baker, then they have gained by their possession. There is nothing to invoke equity’s aid, and the statute must be enforced. Eason v. Eason, 61 Texas, 226; Ann Berta Lodge v. Leverton, 42 Texas,. 26; Wooldridge v. Hancock, 70 Texas, 21; Williams v. Morris, 95 U. S., 444. Hutcheson, Carrington & Sears, for appellee. Ho question of rental value or of other compensation to appellee for her valuable improvements can properly arise in this case. The gift was distinctly, unequivocally, and unquestionably made to her; she was placed in complete, exclusive, and adverse possession in pursuance of the gift; she made valuable and permanent improvements upon the property on the faith and inducement of the gift; she was induced and allowed by Baker to alter her position on the faith of this gift, so that she could not be restored to her former condition; she would not have so changed her position, made the improvements, and done what she did do but for this gift; and all this was with the knowledge and concurrence of W. R. Baker. Dugan v. Colville, 8 Texas, 126; Ottenhouse v. Burleson, 11 Texas, 87; Hendricks v. Snediker, 30 Texas, 296; Ann Berta Lodge v. Leverton, 42 Texas, 26; Murphy v.

"KEY, Associate Justice. Appellant brought this suit against the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, a corporation, for the recovery of a debt and foreclosure of a mechanic’s and builder’s lien on certain real estate in the city of San Antonio. There were several other defendants, only one of whom, S. D. Scudder, contested appellant’s alleged lien. Some disclaimed, and others made default. The Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was one of the latter. Appellee Scudder averred in his answer, that prior to the accrual of appellant’s alleged lien, the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company executed a deed of trust on the property, to secure a debt for borrowed money, to himself and W. J. B. Patterson for $15,000, and that in pursuance of the trust deed it was sold to said Scudder. He also averred that he was the owner of a judgment lien against the property superior to appellant’s asserted lien. The trial court filed findings of facts, which we adopt, as follows: “1. That the defendant the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company is indebted to the plaintiff, H. Schultze, in the sum of $1824.51 principal, and $174.30 interest, aggregating the sum of $1998.81. “ 2. That said debt found to-be due the plaintiff is so due him for labor and material furnished by him to the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, under a contract with said company for the construction of a house or factory situated upon the lot of land described in the pleadings, and being 1 all that certain tract or parcel of land lying and being in the State of Texas, county of Bexar, within the corporate limits of the city of San Antonio, on the corner of West Houston and Cameron Streets, bounded on the north by said West Houston Street, on the east by said Cameron Street, on the south by the old Odet property, and on the west by San Pedro Creek.’ “ It is further found as a fact, that said material and labor so furnished by plaintiff to said defendant toward and upon the improvements on said property was furnished between the 1st day of March, 1887, and the 14th day of December, 1887. That the account attached to the plaintiff’s petition, amounting to $2624.50, for said labor and material, is correct, except that on February 16, 1888, plaintiff received from said company $800 in the capital stock of said company, and allowed credit accordingly. “ 3. The court further finds as a fact, that previous to December 14, 1887, the defendant the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, being unable to construct the wood and frame work necessary for the support of the iron and tin work yet to be done by plaintiff, the plaintiff, with consent of said defendants, stopped work and delivery of materials. That plaintiff did on said 14th day of December, 1887, and within less than four months after the accrual of his said debt, file for registration in the office of the county clerk of Bexar County the itemized account of his said claim, verified by affidavit as the same appears in exhibit A, attached to plaintiff’s petition, and did cause the same to be recorded; said exhibit A, with the affidavits and certificates thereto attached, being now here referred to by the court, and not deemed necessary to be herein copied, because said exhibit shows fully the steps taken. “The court further finds, that plaintiff made the verbal contract for said labor and material furnished with the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company substantially as alleged by him, and performed said contract substantially as alleged by him, until further performance was prevented by said defendant in the manner aforesaid. “ 4. That in February and March, 1887, and up to and until the 3d day of November, 1887, the Alamo Ice Company was the owner of the lot of land on which said building was constructed, and on that day the said Alamo Ice Company conveyed the said land to the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, by deed duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded. “5. That the Alamo Ice Company was chartered on the 23d day of May, 1881, for the purpose of manufacturing and selling ice and such other articles as the machinery used in making ice may be adapted to. “ 6. That the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was chartered on the 12th day of October, 1886, for the purpose of manufacturing ice and beer. “ 7. That the officers and some of the stockholders of the Alamo Ice Company and the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company in February and March, 1887, were identical, J. H. Smye being the president, and W. C. Peters the secretary of the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, and having held those positions in the Alamo Ice Company prior to selling out. And in in the fall of 1886, Smye and Peters, having received new stock in lieu of it, transferred their stock in the Alamo Ice Company to the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, subject to some debts for which a portion of it was pledged. That this stock so transferred constituted a majority of the capital stock of the Alamo Ice Company. That the other stockholders made transfers of their stock from time to time until the 15th of November, 1887, before it was all transferred and new stock of the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company issued in place of it. “ 8. That on the 10th day of November, 1887, the Phil Best Brewing Company recovered a judgment in the Federal court at San Antonio, against the Alamo Ice Company, otherwise known as the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, for $3145.12, an abstract of which was duly filed, indexed, and recorded in the records of the office of the county clerk of Bexar County on the 11th day of November, 1887, at 2:30 o’clock p. m. “9. That on the 15th day of November, 1887, the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, through its proper officers, made a deed of trust on the property in the angle of Houston and Cameron Streets, heretofore described, to secure three notes of $5000 each, which deed of trust named H. P. Drought as trustee, and was duly recorded on the 15th day of November, 1887. “ 10. That the judgment in the United States court in the case of the Phil Best Brewing Company v. Alamo Ice Company was rendered on the 11th day of November, 1887, and execution was issued thereon on the 29th day of December, 1887, and returned 6 by order of the plaintiffs attorney’ on the 5th day of May, 1888. “11. That from the 1st of March, 1887, until the 3d day of November, 1887, the possession of the lot of land and the improvements and plant thereon was in J. H. Smye and W. C. Peters, who were stockholders, directors, and officers in the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, and held the same positions in the Alamo Ice Company prior to selling out and transferring their stock in that company.” And the following is added, as further findings of facts by this court: 12. The testimony further shows, that in 1886, J. H. Smye, its president, and W. C. Peters, its secretary, owned six-tenths of the capital stock of the Alamo Ice Company; that the firm of Leroux & Cosgrove and Alfred Giles owned the remaining four-tenths of its capital stock. That the owners of a majority of said stock determined to enlarge the business by including therein the manufacture of beer, and for that purpose the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was chartered and organized; all the stockholders of the Alamo Ice Company agreed to this change in the business except Giles, and it was not shown that appellant knew of his objecting until after he furnished the labor and material constituting the debt sued on. That appellant was engaged to furnish said labor and material by said Smye and Peters, president and secretary of the two corporations, while they were in possession of and managing the property. That part of the same was furnished after November 3, 1887, though what proportion is not shown. That Smye and Peters considered themselves in possession of the property for the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company at the time they employed appellant. That appellant did not know the condition of the title to the property until in December, 1887. 13. It was shown that all the stockholders of the Alamo Ice Company except Giles knew that appellant was furnishing labor and material to build the house on the land in question, and none of them objected. 14. The testimony also shows that the three notes for $5000 each, mentioned in the ninth finding of the court below, were made to Patterson & Scudder, and were for borrowed money, part of which was used in the construction of the improvements on the lot in controversy, and that said debt was secured by the trust deed referred to in said finding. Patterson admitted in his answer that his partner, Scudder, had acquired all the rights of Patterson & Scudder under the deed of trust to the property in question. 15. At the time of taking the trust deed, Scudder caused the record to be searched, and found no encumbrances on the property. The District Court rendered judgment for appellant against the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company for the amount of his debt; but held, that on the facts shown he had never acquired a lien on the real estate in question. It was also held, that appellee Scudder under his pleadings and proof was not entitled to affirmative relief, and was given judgment for his costs onty. 1. As appellee Scudder failed to connect himself with the recorded judgment in favor of the Phil Best Brewing Company, and lias assigned no error upon the action of the court in excluding evidence offered for that purpose, we deem it unnecessary to specially consider that branch of the case. 2. Appellant alleged in his petition that the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was the owner of the land at the time the contract for labor and material was made, and said company, as defendant, filed no answer, but made default. Under these circumstances, as against this company, appellant was not required to prove its ownership of the land at the time the contract in question was made; and as the record does not show that the trust deed to secure the mone3’"" borrowed by said company from Patterson & Scudder has ever been foreclosed, he was, at least, entitled to a judgment establishing and foreclosing his lien against the property in question, subject to the Patterson & Scudder debt. In other words, as the evidence does not show that the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company’s equity of redemption has been sold and bought in by Scudder, as alleged in his answer, and as the company made default, appellant was entitled to a judgment subjecting the company’s right of redemption to the satisfaction of his debt. 3. Appellant contends, however, that he is entitled to a judgment establishing his lien against the property and according it priority over the mortgage lien of Patterson & Scudder, or any right or title dependent upon their mortgage. On the other hand, Scudder resists this contention, and claims, that as the mortgagor, the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, had no title to the land upon which the house was built at the time it contracted with appellant to furnish labor and material for its construction, appellant could not, and did not, acquire a lien on the property, although said company acquired title thereto prior to the execution of the mortgage under which appellee claims', and pending performance by appellant of his part of the contract. These diverse propositions present the principal, if not the controlling, question in the case. The trial court concurred in the views urged by counsel for Scudder, and held that appellant never acquired any lien on the property. In this ruling we think there was error. In this State, builders’ and mechanics’ liens rest upon both constitutional and statutory provisions of law. The former is in the following language: “Mechanics, artisans, and material men of every class shall, have a lien upon the buildings and articles made or repaired by them, for the value of their labor done thereon or material furnished therefor; and. the Legislature shall provide by law for the speedy and efficient enforcement of said liens.” Const., art. 16, sec. 37. So much of the statute relating to this subject as bears upon the questions involved in this case reads as follows: “Any person or firm, lumber dealer, artisan, or mechanic, who may labor or furnish material, machinery, fixtures, and tools to erect any house or improvement, or to repair any building or improvement whatever, under or by virtue of any contract with the owner or proprietor thereof, or his agent, trustee, or contractor, upon complying with the provisions of this act, shall have a lien on such house,” etc. Rev. Stats., art. 3164. It is true, perhaps, that a strict interpretation of the statute will limit-its benefits to those who furnish labor, material, etc., under a contract with the owner, or with his agent, trustee, or contractor, made while he is such owner. But in view of the broad language of the Constitution and our statutory provision which declares that the rule of the common law, that statutes in derogation thereof shall be strictly construed, shall have no application to the Revised Statutes, and that the provisions thereof shall be liberally construed, with a view to effect their objects and to promote justice (General Provisions Revised Statutes, section 3), we do not think this interpretation ought to prevail in this case. Mr. Jones, in his treatise on Liens, section 1248, uses this language: “ One having merely a contract for the purchase of land can not subject the freehold to a mechanic’s lien, although he subsequently, after the completion of the work for which a lien is claimed, takes a conveyance of the fee in pursuance of a contract.” A number of cases are cited by this author to support the doctrine announced, many of which have very little and some have no application. The strongest case referred to is that of Howard v. Veazie, 3 Gray, 233. In this and all other cases cited by this author to support the text, rights, of third persons differing from the rights of the parties to the contract were involved. In the case mentioned, the Massachusetts lien statute was construed. In that State it is provided, that 11 such lien shall not attach unless the contract is made in writing and signed by the owner of the land, or some person duly authorized by him, and recorded in the registry of deeds for the county where the land lies.” The same statute declares, that “if the person who procures the work to be done has an estate for life only, or any other estate less than a fee simple, in the land on which the work is to be done, he shall nevertheless be considered as the owner for the purposes of this chapter, to the extent of his right and interest in the land, and the lien before provided for shall bind his whole estate and interest therein.” It was held by the court, that the word “ owner,” as used in that statute, had reference to the time of the execution of the contract; and it was also held, that the lien was dependent upon and existed when the written contract was executed and recorded. The cases of Hayes v. Fessenden, 106 Massachusetts, 228, and Middleton Savings Bank v. Fellows, 42 Connecticut, 36, are in line with the case of Howard v. Veazie; but the Connecticut case is weakened by the dissent of two judges of the five composing the court? A somewhat similar rule appears to prevail in Maine. Connor v. Lewis, 16 Me., 268; Johnson v. Pike, 35 Me., 291. Other authorities, however, not cited by Mr. Jones, support a much more liberal construction of lien statutes. In the case of Coleman v. Goodnow et al., 36 Minnesota, 9, it was shown, that the plaintiff furnished the last of the material for the erection of a building, about the 16th day of December, 1880; the building was commenced in October, 1880, the defendants being in possession of the premises at the time; it was not shown that they had any contract to purchase, and when the contract was made the defendants had not acquired title to the land, but the same was owned by one Pease, who conveyed the same to the defendant Goodnow, November 23, 1880. In that case the mechanic’s lien was upheld; the court holding that the acquisition of title by Goodnow united in him the ownership of the house and lot, and that the lien rested upon his interest in both, and that he would not be permitted to defeat it by setting up title in a third person previous to that date. It is true, that the opinion does not disclose the terms of the statute then in foi;ce in that State, nor have we had access thereto. We infer, however, from the tenor of the opinion, that the statute in question required a contract with the owner. See also Hooker v. McGlone, 42 Conn., 95. Mr. Phillips announces the true rule to be, that the person for whom the improvement is made will be estopped from denying that he is the owner of the land. Phil, on Mech. Liens, sec. 187. , In construing remedial statutes, regard should be had for the spirit as well as the letter of the law. In order to effect its object and attain the ends of justice, the statute in question should be liberally construed; but to avoid injustice to others, not its beneficiaries, it should also be fairly construed. Applying this rule of construction in the case at bar, and bearing in mind the fact that before appellant filed his account, as required by the statute, to secure his lien, and pending performance of the contract by him, the other party to the contract, the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, acquired title to the premises, we hold, that as between them he has his lien on the property; and unless appellee Scudder is protected as an innocent purchaser or mortgagee, this lien is superior to his claim. That the Constitution is to be considered in determining who are the beneficiaries under, and the extent and scope of the law securing such liens, see the opinion in Keating Implement and Machine Company v. Marshall Light and Power Company, 74 Texas, 605. In that case a very plausible construction of a provision of the statute was repudiated, because its adoption would restrict a right fixed and secured by the Constitution. The rule of construction, applicable in many States of the Union, that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly' construed, probably had considerable influence in producing the line of decisions that place rigid interpretations upon statutes creating and securing mechanics’ and material men’s liens. Indeed, Mr. Jones, in section 1554 of his treatise on Liens, says: “ Mechanics’ liens are in derogation of the common law, depending for their existence wholly upon statutes; and therefore, upon the question whether a lien attaches at all, a strict construction is proper.” As before said, and for reasons given, this rule of construction has no application in this State. 4. Appellee Scudder, however, claims protection as a bona fide mortgagee and purchaser for value and without notice. This claim is founded upon these facts: November 15, 1887, Patterson & Scudder made a loan of $15,000 to the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company, to secure which a trust deed was executed by said company on the property in question; at the time of making this loan, they caused the records of Bexar County to be examined, and found no evidence of appellant’s lien or claim on record, and Patterson admitted in his answer that the averments in Scudder’s answer, to the effect that the property had been sold under the deed of trust and purchased by him, Scudder, were true. As against appellant, the record contains no proof of such sale. It was not charged in the answer, and there was no evidence tending to show, that the money was loaned or mortgage taken because of any concealment, misrepresentation, or other fraudulent conduct on the part of appellant. Appellant’s claim against the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company was founded upon a verbal contract, by the terms of which he was to furnish all the sheet iron, tin, galvanized iron, and other like material, as well as the necessary labor, to cover the sides and roof of a factory; and under article 3166, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, he was allowed four months after his demand became due to secure his lien by filing for record his verified account. His debt was not due until the company notified him of its insolvency and inability to complete the building, and directed him to quit work thereon; and he at once filed his account in compliance with the statute referred to. It follows, therefore, that although appellant’s lien was not of record when the mortgage was taken, the fact of it not being recorded does not rest upon any negligence or fault of his. Under the existing conditions, it could not have been recorded sooner than it was—December 14, 1887. This being the case, the doctrine of innocent purchaser founded upon noncompliance with registration statutes has no application; and it follows, no fraud being charged against appellant, that if his lien antedates the mortgage, it must be accorded priority. It was held in Trammell v. Mount, 68 Texas, 215: “The lien of a mechanic, though not fixed before record of the contract or bill of particulars, when it is fixed, relates back to the time when the work was performed or material furnished, and hence takes precedence of all claims to the property improved which have been fastened upon it since that time.” In Keating Implement and Machine Company v. Marshall Light Company, supra, this doctrine was reaffirmed, and the broad proposition asserted, that within the period of time allowed by the statute for the lien to be fixed by being recorded, every person dealing with the property is charged with notice of the existence of the lien. In our opinion, appellant’s lien existed at and from the time he begun performance of his contract, and no sufficient showing is made by the facts proved or alleged to postpone it to the mortgage under which Scudder claims. The judgment of the District Court will therefore be reversed, and judgment rendered in this court for appellant against the Alamo Ice and Brewing Company for $1998.81, with interest at 8 per cent per annum from the 26th day of March, 1889, and establishing and foreclosing his mechanic’s lien as prayed for against all the defendants. Reversed and rendered. Delivered January 18, 1893.","H. Schultze v. Alamo Ice and Brewing Company et al. No. 33. 1. Mechanic’s Lien —Equity of Redemption.—In suit to enforce mechanic’s lien against alleged owner and an encumbrancer by mortgage upon the property, the alleged owner made default, and it did not appear that the mortgage had been foreclosed. Held, that plaintiff was entitled to decree of foreclosure of the equity of redemption in the property. . 2. Same—Construction of Statute.—Construing the Constitution and legislation under it relating to mechanics’ liens, it is held, that as between the parties the lien exists in favor of a mechanic working on a contract made with one not owning the land upon which the work was being performed, but who obtained title while the work was pending. The rule that statutes in derogation of the common law must he strictly construed does not obtain in this State. 3. Same— Parol Contract.— In absence of fraud, a mechanic’s lien fixed in the manner prescribed by the statute (article 3166, Revised Statutes), by filing for record his verified account within the time prescribed by the statute, takes priority over a mortgage made and recorded subsequent to the beginning of the work. 4.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. The appellee, Nathan Mitchell, on the 25th day of August, 1887, sued John King, the appellant, in -trespass to try title for a strip of land on the north end of survey No. 25 — that is, a strip 78.42 varas wide. Survey 25, in the name of Anselmo Gallan, is described as south of survey 24, in the name of Thomas Thatcher, the former calling for the south line of the latter. Defendant answered not guilty; that the land sued for was vacant land and had been pre-empted by him; and if it was held not to be vacant when pre-empted, that it was a part of survey 24, adjoining 25; and since the suit was brought, to-wit, on June —, 1888, he had purchased the same from Ed. Braden, who owned the southern portion of 24, which title he pleads. * Plaintiff replied, denying the answer, and alleging that the land in suit was not a part of 24, but was a part of 25; also, that some twelve years before, Ed. Braden, being in possession of that part of the land of survey 24 next adjoining the land in suit on the north, erected a division fence on what was then considered by him and plaintiff the division line between the two surveys, plaintiff then owning survey 25; that the fence has remained where it was placed, and is now standing; that it was tacitly, if not expressly, agreed by plaintiff and Braden at that time and ever afterward to be the division line between the two surveys; that in 1884, plaintiff being the owner of survey 25, desiring to enclose the land, obtained Braden’s consent and agreement that plaintiff should join on to the division fence, which both had considered and agreed was the division line, whereby both parties acted on the former understanding and tacit agreement that the fence was on the line; and plaintiff did join to the same, enclosing the strip in question, since which time he has been in the quiet possession of the same until ejected by defendant, as alleged in original petition. A jury was waived, and the cause submitted to the court, who rendered judgment for plaintiff, stating therein the grounds of the judgment as being of opinion that there was no vacancy between surveys 24 and 25, and that therefore there were no pre-emption rights; and “ the court being of the opinion that the south boundary, line of survey No. 24 and the north boundary line of survey No. 25 being one and the same, and that said line had long since and for many years been established and acquiesced in by the owners, and is now, as it has been for many years, marked by a line of fence extending along said line, erected by one Ed. Braden, the same is hereby established as the true and correct boundary line,” etc. Defendant appealed, and assigns errors by the court: 1. In holding that there was no vacancy. 2. In holding that the excess belonged to survey 25. 3. The evidence shows that survey 24 is the older survey, and is entitled to the land in controversy, if it is an excess. 4. The holding that the land is an excess and belongs to survey 25 changes all the original calls; while holding that it belongs to survey 24, or defendant, harmonizes with the calls. The material facts, as we find them, are: There are about 1118 acres of land in survey 24, and 464 acres in"" survey 25. The alleged vacancy is not quite 38 acres; the strip between the surveys is 78.42 varas wide. Survey 24 was made in February, 1838, and survey 25 in June, 1838. Survey 24 calls its south line as running from a mound, west 1547 varas to a stake, from which two mesquites are named as bearings. The north line of survey 25 calls for the south line of No. 24, and to run with its full length 1547 varas between two other surveys, and at the northwest corner of 25 the same witness trees are called for that are named to identify the southwest corner of 24. There is evidence tending to show that the line of 24 is where plaintiff claims it to be — enough to support such a conclusion if the court had so found; but there is testimony tending to show that it can not be identified on the ground, and that distance will leave a vacancy between the two surveys. It is shown that defendant has complied with the preliminary requirements of the law as a pre-emptor of the land in suit, by making application, supported by affidavit, and having the land surveyed as such by the proper surveyor, and by residence upon the land; the application being made February 9, 1885, the survey February 3, 1886. It was admitted that plaintiff owned survey 25, which was patented in June, 1881. Survey 24 was patented in February, 1849. It was proved that Braden built his fence on what he believed was his south line (the south line of survey 24) in 1878; that he at no time claimed any land south of his fence, and has since claimed the fence as the line. It was also proved that plaintiff, owning survey 25, though he thought the fence too far south, recognized it as the division line between the two surveys, and that he acted upon it by enclosing all of survey 25, and joining to the fence by Braden’s consent. He says, and the court below having so found if necessary to his conclusion upon this subject, we find, that Braden was present when he joined fences and agreed that he should do so. Delivered December 14, 1892. In out opinion, the conclusion of the court below, that there was no vacancy between surveys 24 and 25, is correct; and this being so, no right of pre-emption could be acquired in the supposed vacancy. It was evidently the intention of the locating surveyor to include all the land; and though there may be some excess, it is not so great as to defeat that intention. Survey 25 being the junior survey and calling for the south line of 24, will extend to that line wherever it is established, there being no unreasonable discrepancy in the distance, even though the south line of 24 may'be an open line. We do not intend to say that it is an open line, for there is some evidence to fix it on the ground as identical with the Braden fence, and quite enough to sustain that conclusion, if it had been so found by the court below. Moore v. Reiley, 68 Texas, 668; Moore v. Stewart, 7 S. W. Rep., 774; Freeman v. Mahoney, 57 Texas, 626; Anderson v. Stamps, 19 Texas, 460. There was no error in the court’s finding that there was no vacancy between the two surveys. The judgment of the court below is not based upon the fact that the excess belongs to survey 25, but upon two facts: that there is no vacancy, and that the line has been established by acquiescence of the owners. There is no error assigned to the latter conclusion; and there being no fundamental error, it will not be disturbed. Floyd v. Rice, 28 Texas, 341, and authorities cited; Browning v. Atkinson, 46 Texas, 606. Finding no error in the judgment of the court below, it is affirmed. Affirmed.","John King v. Nathan Mitchell. No. 54. Survey Calling for Another — Excess. — Where two surveys are made near the same time, and the junior calls for the older, the junior survey will extend to the older survey called for, wherever established, even if such call be an open line, when there is no unreasonable discrepancy in the distance called for. Appeal from Bexar. Tried below before Hon. G. H. Noonan. Peter Shields, for appellant. An excess belongs to the older of two adjoining surveys, especially when the younger calls for the line of the older survey, and such line includes the excess in the older survey. Henry E. Vernor, for appellee. An excess in either of the surveys between which a common boundary line has been established, by agreement or acquiescence of the respective proprietors, will not affect the validity of the line so fixed, and the excess becomes the property of the owner receiving the surplus.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. The first assignment of error is, that the court erred in overruling the exception to the petition, because of its omission to allege that appellant knew, or by the use of ordinary care could have- known, of the incompetency of the servant from whose negligence it is alleged that appellee’s injury resulted. The petition alleged, that the act of employing a servant was done in a careless and negligent manner, and that in consequence thereof an incompetent servant was taken into appellant’s service. This was not an abstract allegation that appellant was guilty of negligence, but a specification of the act complained of and charged to have been done in a negligent manner. This, we think, was sufficient. To have alleged that appellant knew, or could have known, of the incompetency of the employe, would have been only a further definition of the negligence charged against it, and would have been a repetition, in other language, of what was involved in the averments made. The second special exception, of the overruling of which appellant complains in its second assignment of error, was based on the absence of an allegation that appellee, while working with the fellow servant, did not know of her unfitness. The question, whether or not one suing to recover damages resulting from the negligence of another must allege and prove the exercise of proper care on his own part, has been discussed in many of the decisions of the Supreme Court. The general rule has been settled in this State, that a plaintiff is not required to negative the assumption of contributory negligence on his own part, unless the facts stated in developing his case expose him to suspicion of its existence, in which event he must clear himself. In Railway v. Cowser, 57 Texas, 293, this principle was applied in a suit for the death of a servant caused by the negligence of his employer. But in Railway v. Crowder, 63 Texas, 502, the rule applicable to such cases was stated to be, that when the servant sues the master for the negligence of the latter, the burden is upon the plaintiff to show that he was not guilty of negligence contributing to his injury, and authorities are cited sustaining that proposition. In Murray v. Railway, 73 Texas., 2, the opinion in the Crowder case is limited to the peculiar facts of that case, which is treated as one of the exceptional instances in which the facts shown in developing the cause of the servant’s death raised the question of contributory negligence and threw upon the plaintiff the burden of removing the suspicion attaching to his conduct. That decision is construed in the same way in Brown v. Sullivan, 71 Texas, 475. In Railway v. Bennett, 76 Texas, 155, which was a suit to recover for the death of a servant caused by the negligence of the master, it is said: “ We think it is now well settled, that unless the plaintiff’s case discloses want of care on the part of the injured party, or exposes him to suspicion of negligence, and the defendant relies upon the defense of contributory negligence, it must be pleaded and proved. It is only when the averments of the petition show a prima facie case of negligence on the part of the injured party, that it becomes necessary that the plaintiff should negative by averment and proof the existence of such negligence. ’ ’ It thus appears that the same rule applies in cases of servants suing as governs suits by other persons, and that in neither is the plaintiff required to anticipate and negative a charge of contributory negligence on his part, when the facts which he states do not suggest that he may have been guilty of it. The same principle applies to the question before us. If the servant, in his petition, is not required to show that the injury of which he complains was not partly the result of his own negligence, he should not be required to allege that he had not assumed the risk resulting to him by negligence of the master. The law imposes upon the master the duty of using ordinary prudence in selecting servants, and makes him liable if one of his servants receives injury because of his negligence in the performance of such duty. The risks resulting from such negligence of the master are not impliedly assumed by the servant in the contract of hiring. When he shows that the master has violated the obligation resting upon him, by negligently employing to work with him an incompetent person, through whose incompetency he has been hurt, he makes a prima facie case. If he knows of the incompetency of his coemploye before he was hurt and continues to work with him, he thereby assumes the risk, and this would afford a defense which the master might allege and prove. But it should not be presumed that the servant knew of the incompetency of his fellow, and he should not therefore be required to allege that he did not know it. The exception was properly overruled. We think the court erred in assuming in its charge, that the fellow servant of appellee was incompetent, and in refusing the special charge asked by appellant submitting that question to the jury. While the evidence is uncontradicted, that the fellow servant, when first employed, was inexperienced and unskilled in the work to which she was put, and would have justified the jury in concluding that she continued so up to the time when plaintiff was hurt, yet such was the character of the work that the jury should have been left to determine from all of the evidence whether or not she was incompetent at the time the accident happened, so as to make it negligent, under the circumstances, for appellant to allow her to do the work. The question of competency must depend largely upon the nature of the work provided for the servant to do, and upon the danger to be apprehended and avoided in performing it. There was error also in refusing to charge, that if plaintiff with ordinary care would have known of the incompetency of the coemploye, she could not recover. This instruction was made proper by the evidence in the case, and the charge given did not contain it. There was no error in allowing the plaintiff to testify that the machine was not handled properly and skillfully by Miss Malcolm when plaintiff was hurt. The witness showed' that she was qualified to speak as an expert, and explained the manner in which the work should have been done. There can be no question that the act in question was improperly done, and even if the opinion of the witness had been incompetent, no injury resulted. The other assignments are not well taken. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. jReversed and remanded. Delivered February 23, 1893.","Galveston Rope and Twine Company v. Mary Burkett. No. 92. 1. Good Petition, where Injury Caused by Incompetent Servant. In a suit for damages resulting from the employment by the master of an incompetent servant, it is unnecessary for the petition to allege that the company knew, or by the use of ordinary care could have known, of the incompetency of the servant. 2. Same—Averment as to Want of Knowledge of Unfitness by Plaintiff.—In such case it is unnecessary for the plaintiff to aver that she had no knowledge of the unfitness of the fellow servant by reason of whose want of -skill she was injured. The plaintiff is not required to anticipate and negative a charge of contributory negligence on her part, when the facts stated in the petition do not suggest that she may have been guilty of it. 3. Charge Erroneous in Assuming Unfitness.—While the uncontradicted evidence showed that the fellow servant when first employed was inexperienced and unskilled in the work to which she was put, and would have justified the jury in concluding that she remained so up to the time when plaintiff was hurt, they should have been left to determine whether she was incompetent at the time of the accident, and a charge that assumed that she was then incompetent was error. 4. Knowledge of Fellow Servant’s Incompetency—Charge.—The jury should have been charged, that if plaintiff, with ordinary care, would have known of the incompetency of the coemploye, she could not recover. 5. Opinion Evidence on Proper Handling of Machine — Opinion—Expert.—The plaintiff showed that she was qualified to speak as an expert,, and explained the manner in which the work should have been done; therefore, it was not error to permit her to testify that the machine was not properly handled by her coemploye.

Appellant was charged with negligence in employing the coservant. James B. & Charles J. Stubbs, for appellant. 1.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This suit was brought in the District Court of Eastland County by appellant, J. C. Roberts, against appellee, D. M. Helm, to recover a strip or tract of land in Eastland County, 330 varas in width and 2736 varas in length, containing 160 acres. The appellant claims this land to be a part of the W. G. McGrew survey. The appellee claims that it is no part of the McGrew survey, and that, as vacant public domain, lying between the McGrew survey west of it and the John Bradley survey east of it, he pre-empted it. The McGrew survey, among other matters, calls to course from its beginning corner east 1650 varas to a stake on the north line of the John Bradley survey; thence south with the west line of the John Bradley survey, passing its southwest corner. To reach a stake on the north line of the Bradley, the course of the north line of the McGrew would be seriously deflected to the north, and the distance traversed in reaching the west line of the Bradley would be 1990 varas, instead of 1650 varas, as called for in the McGrew field notes. One J. P. Davidson testified for the plaintiff, that in 1871, as county surveyor of Eastland County, he surveyed the G. W. McGrew survey; that he was actually on the ground; that he ran the north and east lines, the east line of the McGrew and the west line of the Bradley being identical. Evidence, on the other hand, was introduced for the defendant impeaching the correctness of Davidson’s statement, and tending to show that no actual survey was made; that the McGrew survey “ was platted on paper as office work.” Delivered October 25, 1892. Such being the condition of the testimony, the court instructed the jury to the effect: 1. That if they should believe the statement of the witness Davidson, no vacancy would exist and the3r would find for plaintiff. 2. That, on the other hand, if the3r should believe that no actual surArey was made by Davidson, but that he “platted the survey without actually running the lines, course and distance would control,” and they would fix the east boundary of the McGrew 1650 varas east of its northwest corner; and if the line thus fixed was west of the land claimed b3r defendant, they would find for the defendant. The jury, evidently influenced ly the latter instruction, returned a verdict accordingly. This latter charge is complained of as error. It will be noted that the other calls in the patent were thus b3r the court subordinated to course and distance. Among the remaining calls is one for the southwest corner of the John Bradley survey as on the east line of the McGrew. This southwest corner of the Bradley is well established. Can it be stated, then, as a matter of law, that in the absence of an actual surve3'' the juiy should be instructed that the McGrew should be identified by reference alone to course and distance ? We think not. When no survey has been made on the ground, the rule is, that in finding the true locality of the land in question, the court or jury should look to all the calls in the patent, and from them should conclude what was the particular land intended to be conveyed. The intention of the State and of the grantee is of controlling force in such investigation, and this intention must be sought by means of all the calls, “matters of description,” in the patent. It is true that such matters of description as are referred to b3r mistake should be disregarded, but in a trial b3r jury the question as to what was the subject matter of such reference should be left to the jury. We think the court erred in the charge complained of, in confining the jury, as a matter of law, to course and distance, in the absence of an actual survey, as the exclusive test of the true localit3T of the McGrew survey.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This suit was brought by the appellants against the appellees, in the District Court of Grayson County, to enjoin the collection of certain taxes assessed and levied by the appellees. The injunction was temporarily granted, but on final hearing it was dissolved. Hence this appeal. Denison was a city with a population of more than 10,000 inhabitants. It was organized under the general law, having accepted the benefits of title 17 of the Revised Statutes. The taxes sought to be enjoined were covered by an ordinance authorizing the collection of taxes for the year 1888, as follows: Section 1. One-fourth of 1 per cent for current expenses. Section 2. One-fifth of 1 per cent for interest, and sinking fund on bonded indebtedness. Section 3. Three-eighths of 1 per cent for maintaining schools. Section 4. One-half of 1 per cent for protection against fire. Section 5. One-fourth of 1 per cent for improving streets, etc. Section 6. One twenty-fifth of-1 per cent for sinking fund for school bonds issued April 2, 1888. Section 7. One-twentieth of 1 per cent for interest on school bonds issued April 2, 1888. Section 8. One-fourth of 1 per cent for paying outstanding floating indebtedness. Section 9. Provides for poll tax. Appellants claim that the taxes included under sections 4 and 8, above set out, were levied wholly without authority, and those referred to in section 5 partly without authority. They allege as to the latter, that for the purpose of improving streets and of constructing permanent improvements, including school houses, the city was limited to an. ad valorem tax of 25 cents on the $100, and, admitting the legality of the tax referred to in sections 6 and 7, they contend, as the evidence showed them to have been levied for the purpose of building school houses, that, to the extent of this tax (9 cents on the $100), the levy referred to in section 5 was excessive. Appellants also claim that the tax referred to in section 8 was illegal, because the “ outstanding floating indebtedness” therein referred to had been incurred for current expenses, and should be included in the item 1 ‘ current expenses;” and that for current expenses the power of the city is limited to a levy of 25 cents on the $100, already exhausted in section 1. They further contend, that the taxes referred to in section 4 were illegal, because the city was without authority to levy taxes for protection against fire. As to the remainder of the sections, they admit the legality of the levy. It will be noted that the aggregate tax levied by the ordinance in question does not amount to 2.) per cent on the $100. Hence, the appellees claim, that as Denison was a city of more than 10,000 inhabitants, it was authorized to levy all the taxes included in the ordinance, and this by virtue of article 426 of the Revised Statutes, which is as follows: “ Cities having more than 10,000 inhabitants may levy, assess, and collect such taxes as may be authorized by law, but no tax for any purpose shall ever be levied for any one year which shall exceed 2-¡- per cent of the taxable property of such city.” The question presented then is this: Was the city of Denison authorized, under the article named, and as found by the lower court, to levy a tax of 25 cents on the $100 to pay outstanding floating indebtedness, incurred for current expenses, though it had already assessed the same amount for current expenses; and further, was it authorized to levy the tax of 50 cents on the $100 for protection against fire; and further, was it authorized to levy a tax of 25 cents on the $100 for improving streets, though it had levied a tax of 9 cents on the $100 for the building of school houses — the entire levy not amounting to as much as 2-|- per cent of the taxable property of said city ? The scheme of municipal taxation, as devised by the framers of our Constitution, proceeds upon different planes, according as it refers to-cities and towns with a population of less than 10,000, and to cities with a population of more than 10,000 inhabitants. This is evident from the organic provisions on this subject, and from the legislation had thereunder. Thus, section 4, article 11, of the Constitution, provides: “ Cities and towns having a population of 10,000 inhabitants or less * * may levy, assess, and collect an annual tax to defray the current expenses-of their local, government, but such tax shall never exceed, for any one year, one-fourth of 1 per cent.” On the other hand, section 5 of the same article is to the following effect: “ Cities having more than 10,000 inhabitants may levy, assess, and collect such taxes as may be authorized by law, but no tax for any purpose shall ever be lawful for any one year which shall exceed 2-J- percent of the taxable property of such city.” * -* * So, in evident conformity to these provisions, articles 425 and 426 respectively of the Revised Statutes were adopted. They fix a similar-limit. The graver burdens and the more important functions of cities of the latter class demanded the difference in the extent of the powers conferred. It is insisted by appellants, however, that cities with a population of more than 10,000 inhabitants were powerless to act under the provisions referred to until such time as they should be ‘1 authorized by law.” Appellants interpret the expression “authorized by law” to mean that the Legislature must have specifically provided the extent and method of taxation before warrant therefor would exist. Cities are charged by the statutes with the duty of protecting their inhabitants from contagious diseases; of providing for their debts and expenses; of providing water for the “ extinguishment of fire and the convenience of their inhabitants;” and of controlling and repairing their streets and highways. To meet such purposes constitutes, mainly, the reason for municipal existence. These duties can not be discharged without money, and to raise money taxation must be resorted to. ‘ ‘ When such a corporation is created, the power of taxation (within the constitutional and charter limit) is vested in it as an essential attribute for all the purposes of its existence, unless its exercise is by express terms prohibited.” United States v. New Orleans, 98 U. S., 381. We therefore conclude, that as the taxes complained of were levied for the purpose of enabling the city of Denison- to discharge the statutory duties which it owed to its inhabitants, and as it did not exceed the limit fixed by the Constitution and the law thereunder, the levy was “ authorized by law,” and should be upheld within the limit named, and the article-in question should be construed to vest the authority to levy the taxes, provided it was called for in the discharge of a duty elsewhere imposed. by the law upon the city. The application of the tax fund, when collected, to the different purposes of corporate existence is.left to the discretion of its authorities, in the absence of special statutory direction. Delivered November 1, 1892. Thus, not having exceeded the limit of 2\ per cent, the city council was empowered to levy a tax of one-half of 1 per cent for protection against fire, of. one-fourth of 1 per cent for improving its streets, and of one-fourth of 1 per cent for paying its outstanding floating indebtedness. Since the institution of this proceeding the article in question has been amended by the Act of 1889, limiting the power of taxation of the cities of the character named to one-half of 1 per cent of the taxable property of the city. This statute, however, being subsequent, can not influence the disposition of the question here presented The levy of 25 cents on the §100 for improving streets is not affected, as contended for by appellants, by the levy for school house purposes, admittedly valid and provided for in sections 6 and 7 of the ordinance. These sections were enacted under the act of the Legislature of March 23, 1887. With reference to this act, we deem it sufficient to say that in our opinion it did not operate as a repeal of article 426. It was enacted with reference to the constitutional amendment of 1883, amending section 9, article 8, of the State Constitution. This section in no way impairs the effect of section 5, article 11, above referred to, and of article 426, Revised Statutes, here construed. Lufkin v. Galveston, 63 Texas, 438. It is therefore ordered that the judgment be affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Head did not sit in this case.","William Muller et al. v. The City of Denison et al. No. 20. 1.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. W. L. Moody & Co. brought suit in the District Court of Anderson County, October 30, 1889, against Martin Hinzie, by attachment for debt. The petition alleged, that on the 15th day of February 1889, the defendant executed and delivered to plaintiffs his two promissory notes in writing, in the first of which he promised on October 15, 1889, to pay to the order of plaintiffs the.sum of $2500, with 12 per cent interest from maturity, and 10 per cent in addition as attorney fees in the event the note was not paid at maturity and should be placed with an attorney for collection; that in the second note he promised to pay to the order of plaintiff on November 15, 1889, the sum of $2500, with 12 per cent interest per annum from maturity, and .10 per cent in addition as attorney fees in the event the note should not be paid at maturity and should be placed in the hands of an attorney for collection; and that by reason of the premises the defendant became bound to pay plaintiffs the said first note, principal, interest, and attorney fees, and, when due, the principal of said second note. The petition showed also that plaintiffs had filed therewith their affidavit and bond for attachment. Plaintiffs’ affidavit as to indebtedness-is: “ That Martin Hinzie, defendant in, attachment, is justly indebted to the said W. L. Moody & Co. in the following amounts, to-wit, in the sum of $2500, with interest thereon at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from October 15, 1889; that above indebtedness is due on promissory note, payable on said October 15, 1889, which said note further stipulates that if it (the note) is not paid at maturity and it (the note) is placed with an attorney for collection, that said Martin Hinzie agrees to pay 10 per cent in addition to the said above; and affiant says that said defendant Hinzie is justly indebted to said W. L. Moody & Co. in the further amount of this 10 per cent. That said Martin Hinzie is justly indebted to said W. L. Moody & Co. in the further sum of $2500 on promissory note, not yet due.” The writ of attachment is in due form, and directs the sheriff to attach forthwith so much of the property of Martin Hinzie, if to be found, repleviable on security, as shall be of value sufficient to make the sum of $5263.75, etc. It was levied upon twenty-seven parcels of land situated in Anderson County, and due return thereof, made, with full description of the land. On November 27, 1889, plaintiffs filed their amended original petition, and declared on both of the notes mentioned in the original petition, and asked for foreclosure of their attachment lien. Defendant moved to quash the attachment, because: 1. A note for $2500 and $250 attorney fees is sued on, while the attachment is for $5263.75. 2. Affidavit alleges $2500 and $250 attorney fees, due October 15, 1889, and also $2500 not due, but fails to allege when the last named debt will become due. 3. Writ is sued out for $5263.75, which was grossly excessive, following the pleadings. 4. There is no affidavit showing when the last named note would become due. A fifth ground for quashing the attachment, so far as not included in the above, is not relied on here. The motion to quash was overruled, and the defendant excepted. Defendant’s answer, filed November 22, 1889, presents no defense that is relied on in this court; but, by leave of the court, Herbert, Agnes Mary, William Eugene, Francis Thomas, Rose Helena, Raymond Carroll, and Joseph Leonard Hinzie, minor children of the defendant and his deceased wife, intervened by their said father, the defendant, as natural guardian and next friend, and made themselves parties to the suit. The defendant also joined in the petition of the interveners in his own right. They setup: 1. Homestead right in and to lot 10, block 163, and lot 20, block 162, of the property levied on as the defendant’s place of business. 2. That Herbert Hinzie is the owner in fee simple of lot 1 in block G-. 3. That of all the other lands levied on, the interveners, as the heirs of their mother, own her community interest therein; that there had been no administration on the estate of the mother, nor any necessity for the same. They prayed judgment that said interests be declared not subject to attachment. Plaintiffs moved to strike out the intervention, because it was not shown “ that said intervenors have any such right in the subject matter of the suit between plaintiff and defendant as entitles them to intervene herein, and because it appears that they have a full and complete remedy at law, and the judgment in this case will not affect their rights.” This motion was sustained by the court, except in so far as the same set up the homestead exemption. Trial was had, and there was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs for the amount of both notes, with interest and attorney fees, with a foreclosure of the attachment lien, except as to lot No. 10 in block 163, and a portion of another lot used in connection with the place of residence. Appellant’s motion to quash the attachment in this case was properly overruled. It is not necessary that the affidavit should state when the amount that is shown not to be due will become due; a separate statement of them is sufficient. Willis v. Mooring, 63 Texas, 340; Munzenheimer & Klein v. Cloak and Suit Co., 79 Texas, 319. The affidavit states plainly what the indebtedness consists of and what portion of it is not due; and it states the facts from which the entire amount can be ascertained. It is also fully sustained by the petition. Ascertaining the entire amount of the indebtedness from the items stated in the affidavit, it appears to be $5263.75, which is the amount stated in the writ. The second note had not become due, and consequently no attorney fees were collectible on it, and it did not bear interest until after maturity, so that as to the second note attachment could run only for the principal thereof. There was no exception taken to the action of the court in dismissing the plea of intervention in so far as it set up title in the minor children of Hinzie and his deceased wife to one-lialf of the property levied on as the community property of their mother, and in Herbert Hinzie the entire interest in one of the lots; and there is no appeal from the judgment of the court in any respect by said minor heirs. The appeal bond is executed by Hinzie alone, and it is made payable to W. L. Moody & Co. alone, so the heirs are not parties to the appeal. Hinzie has appealed in his own right alone. But we do not see any error in the action of the court. The heirs were not interested in the subject matter of the suit, and they did not show any equitable grounds for such intervention. Whitman v. Willis, 51 Texas, 424; Hinzie v. Kempner, 82 Texas, 620. Whether or not the warehouse in controversy was a part of the business homestead of the defendant, presents a question of some difficulty. We do not deem it necessary to examine appellant’s several assignments of error, raising this question, separately, because they all lead to the one question as to the exemption of the warehouse. Appellant contends that it is a mixed question of law and of fact which should have been submitted to the jury, and that it was error for the court in its charge to instruct the jury that the warehouse was not exempt. If the facts showed that the warehouse was not exempt as a part of the defendant’s business homestead, then it would be proper for the court to so charge the jury. We find the facts with reference to the use of the warehouse to be as follows: On the 27th day of October, 1889, M. Hinzie was a merchant in the city of Palestine, and as such was a wholesale and retail dealer in groceries, hardware, and tinware, and his storehouse, which he kept open, and in which he exposed his goods for sale, and in which he kept his office and books, was situated on lot No. 10 in block No. 163 of said city. Across the street, and in another block, and on lot No. 20, in block No. 162, he had his warehouse, in which he kept his goods in unbroken packages, and stoves and heavy goods; also kept there tinners’ tools, etc., and heavy and bulky goods. This warehouse was kept closed, generally, and the key to it kept in the other building. Goods were not exposed for sale in it, but he sometimes sold goods from it. When a customer came into the other building and wanted goods not in it, but in the warehouse, he would then take the key to the warehouse, go over there and sell the needed article or articles, and then lock it and return the key to the other building. The goods were kept in bulk in the warehouse; no shelves, nor counters, nor office. Hinzie called this house his warehouse. In it was a room in which Mr. Lowenstein, who was a practical tinner in Hinzie’s employ, kept his tin and sheet-iron tools, and Lowenstein also slept in this building. Upon this lot Hinzie also had a privy and water closet, which was used by himself and employes. Lot 10 in block 162 was covered with a two-story brick building, and fronted on the main business street in the city, and the warehouse was a frame building and was purchased by him several years after he had begun business in the other building. On October 27, Hinzie made a deed of trust upon all of his goods situated in both of these buildings, and gave to the trustee exclusive possession of the goods and the house in which they were situated, except that Hinzie retained the possession of his office in the brick building. The evidence is undisputed that the business was transacted in the brick building on lot No. 10, and that the building on lot No. 20 was used only as a warehouse, except that the tinner slept in it and the water closet was on the premises. A warehouse on the same lot with the regular business house and attached to it as an enlargement thereof, has been held to be exempt. Hargadene v. Whitfield, 71 Texas, 489. But in McDonald v. Campbell, 57 Texas, 614, a warehouse situated on a different lot from that in which the business was conducted, and not adjacent thereto, was held not to be exempt. The evidence shows that the use of the warehouse in connection with the defendant’s business was bona fide and valuable; and if the question was such an one as should have been submitted to the jury, there could have been no doubt but that the jury would have returned a verdict that the warehouse was a part of the defendant’s business homestead. We do not think, however, that such a business home is within the contemplation of the Constitution. The lots must be used for the purpose of a home, or as a place in which to exercise the calling or business of the family. Outlets may be used' for such purposes in connection with a home as would make them a part of the homestead; but the business home must be the place ■where the head of the family exercises his calling or business. It is his workshop, office, or other place where he habitually is in the following of his calling, and not every other lot or building which he may incidentally use in connection therewith. Once begin to exempt warehouses and storerooms as a part of the business homestead, and there would be no limit except the value at the time of their designation as prescribed in the Constitution. Delivered October 14, 1892. We think that the design of the Constitution was to protect the workshop and business office, but in the practical application of the law large storerooms for goods exposed for sale have been necessarily included when they constitute the place of business. The business homestead should be confined to the place where the calling or business is exercised, and is not to be extended to outlots which may be used for the purposes of the home, as in the case of the residence. We think the facts conclusively show that the warehouse was not exempt, and that the court did not err in so instructing the jury. The judgment of the court below is affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Williams did not sit in this case.","Martin Hinzie v. W. L. Moody & Co. No. 8. 1. Affidavit for Attachment. — An affidavit for attachment which states that defendant is justly indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $2500 with interest thereon at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from October 15,1889, and the further amount of 10 per cent as attorney fees, and that defendant is also indebted to plaintiff in the further sum of $2500 on promissory note not yet due, being otherwise sufficient, is good. It is not necessary that the affidavit should state when the amount that is not showü to be due will become due. 2. Intervention by Heirs. — Attachment being levied upon community property in which the heirs of the deceased mother had an interest, to protect which interest they intervened, held, that intervenors have no such equitable right as entitles them to intervene, and that there was no error in sustaining exceptions to the plea. 3. Practice — Appeal by Intervenors. — No exceptions being taken to the action of the court dismissing the intervention, and the bond for appeal being executed by defendant alone, and made payable to plaintiff alone, the intervenors are not parties to the appeal, and assignment of errors by them will not be considered. 4. Business Homestead. — Defendant had a two-story brick store house on lot 10, block 163, where he exposed his goods for sale and kept his books and office; but several years after he began business he purchased lot 20 in block 162, across the street, upon which was a frame warehouse in which he kept his goods in unbroken packages and his stoves and bulky and heavy goods. The building was generally kept closed and the key in the other house, but he sometimes sold goods from it, and a tinner slept there, and upon the lot there was a water closet used by himself and his employes. Held, that the action of the court below in refusing to submit the question of homestead to the jury, as to lot 20, and in instructing them that lot 20 was not exempt, was not error. 5. Business Homestead Defined. — Under the Constitution, the lots must be used as a place where the head of the family exercises his calling or business. It is his workshop, office, or other place where he habitually is, in the following of his calling, and not any other lot or building which he may incidentally use in connection therewith.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This controversy, as here presented, involves an issue between the appellants, Sarah M. McWhirter and others, and the appellees, S. B. Allen and others, with reference to the title to a tract of 13 labors of land lying three and a half miles northwest from the town of Bonham, in Fannin County. The suit, brought by appellants, is in the nature of an action of trespass to try title. Plaintiffs seek to remove an alleged cloud from their title by the cancellation of 'patent No. 474, volume 19, for 13 labors or 13,000,000 square varas of land, issued to Washington S. McClure, assignee of G. W. King, July 5, 1873, and to be restored to their alleged rights under patent No. 468, volume 19, issued to William S. Grace, as assignee of G. W. King, June 30, 1873. Appellants claim as heirs of William S. Grace; appellees as vendees, by mesne conveyances, of Washington S. McClure. All the parties claim under a certificate in the name of G. W. King for 26 labors of land. 1. The land in controversy is a part of a survey located by virtue of certificate No. 661, issued to G. W. King, for 26,000,000 square varas of land, on July 6, 1838. 2. January 18, 1839, G. W. King transferred one-half of this certificate to John McClure. February 20, 1839, McClure transferred this half to W. S. Grace. July 7, 1839, Grace located his portion of the certificate on a tract of land in Red River County, Texas. 3. November 28, 1838, G. W. King located his portion of the certificate on another tract of land in Red River County. 4. W. S. Grace died in the year 1840, and plaintiffs and appellants are his only heirs. 5. After the location by Grace of his portion of the certificate on the tract in Red River County, the location was lifted, and his portion of the certificate was, on January 15, 1844, relocated on a tract of land lying on Pilot Grove Creek, now in Collin County. 6. After the location by King of his portion of the certificate on the tract in Red River County, his location was lifted, and on January 15, 1847, it was relocated on the land in controversy. 7. .November 23, 1848, G. W. King transferred his portion of the certificate, with its location, to W. S. McClure. 8. June 30, 1873, Jacob Keuchler, Commissioner of the General Land Office, issued a patent for the survey, including the land in suit, to W. S. Grace. This patent was never delivered to any one. It was retained in the office by the Commissioner, who, on July 3, 1873, wrote across its face the following words: “ Cancelled, July 3, 1873, having issued to the wrong assignee. Jacob Keuchler, Commissioner,” 9. July 5, 1873, the Commissioner issued to W„ S. McClure a patent for the above mentioned survey, and appellees herein hold by mesne conveyances under McClure. We do not concur with appellants that the court erred in overruling their objection to the transfer from G. W. King to Washington S. McClure. This objection was two-fold: 1. The transfer was void in failing to sufficiently describe the land conveyed. 2. The transfer showed upon its face that the words ‘ ‘ the survey lying between Bois d’Arc and Caney, Fannin County,” were fraudulently interpolated after the transfer was executed and delivered; this being apparent from the fact that these words were written in black ink, while the remainder of the instrument was wholly in blue ink. The property is described in the transfer substantially as follows: “One-half, or 13 labors of land, of the headlight certificate of the grantor, George W. King, to one league and labor of land, No. 661, first class, issued by the Board of Land Commissioners for Red River County, Republic of Texas; the survey lying between Bois d’Arc and Caney, Fannin County, Texas.” Any uncertainty as to the identity of the land conveyed by this instrument could, it is evident, be explained by extrinsic testimony, and the deed was not void for want of description. Kingston v. Pickins, 46 Texas, 99; Wilson v. Smith, 50 Texas, 365; Brown v. Chambers, 63 Texas, 131; Overand v. Menczer, 83 Texas, 122. As to the second objection: The transfer bears date November 23, 1848. It appears to have been recorded in Fannin County, June 7, 1853, and to have been filed in the Land Office August 22, 1853. These facts, we think, authorized the admission of the transfer in evidence as an ancient instrument, though an affidavit had been made impeaching its genuineness. The fact of the insertion or interpolation, and the date and intention thereof, were questions for the consideration of the jury. Brown v. Simpson’s Heirs, 67 Texas, 225; Parker v. Chancellor, 73 Texas, 475; Rodriguez v. Haynes, 76 Texas, 225. There are several other assignments of error. We are not required to state them or to consider them consecutively. They are founded principally upon two propositions: 1. When the patent No. 468, dated June 30, 1873, in favor of Wm., S. Grace, was signed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Governor, it was thereby issued; delivery was not essential to make it effective, and it was not in the power of the Commissioner to cancel it, though his signature had been affixed to it by mistake. 2. The patent so issued was in and of itself such evidence of title as to render it improper in the court to charge the jury with reference to the question, “ Who first appropriated the land by valid survey, the plaintiffs, claiming as the heirs of Grace, or the defendants, claiming as vendees of McClure?” Waiving consideration of the former of these propositions, we are clearly of the opinion that the view suggesting the latter is erroneous. This error pervades quite generally appellants’ assignments. In fact, it constitutes the burden of their contention. If, as a matter of fact, the land in controversy was appropriated by a valid location and survey made for McClure, and the patent for the land was afterwards issued and delivered to Grace, he would thereby acquire no title. The patent could confer no right upon Grace to lands previously appropriated by McClure. The patent thus issued to Grace would be invalid. Sherwood v. Fleming, 25 Texas Supp., 409; Wyllie v. Wynne, 26 Texas, 43. The plaintiffs requested two special instructions, and assign their rejection as error. The first of these instructions contains the proposition that the burden rested upon the defendants to show, in the event the patent was issued to Grace, that it was issued wrongfully. As a patent on its face is evidence of title in the patentee, it follows that it would devolve upon one claiming adversely to it to show that it was issued without authority. The proposition referred to might therefore require consideration from us but for the fact that it is connected in the requested charge with propositions distinct in character, and which, in our opinion, it would have been improper in the court to submit to the jury. The action of the court under such circumstances in rejecting the entire instruction does not afford cause of complaint. Hamburg v. Wood & Co., 66 Texas, 176. The court, in a charge which impresses us as apposite and impartial, correctly referred to the jury, as a test whereby to determine the rights of the parties, the question, “ Who, by valid location, first appropriated the land in controversy?” This question the jury, under evidence warranting their action, answered in favor of the appellees. We are not authorized to disturb their verdict; and the judgment is therefore affirmed. Delivered December 20, 1892. Affirmed.","Sarah M. McWhirter et al. v. S. B. Allen et al. No. 53. 1. Deed — Description of Land. — A transfer describing the land conveyed as “ one-half, or 13 labors of land, of the headright certificate of the grantor, George W. King, to one league and labor of land, No. 661, first class, issued by the Board of Land Commissioners for Bed River County, Republic of Texas; the survey lying between Bois d’Arc and Caney, Fannin County, Texas,” is not void for want of description, since it is evident that any uncertainty as to the identity of this land can be explained by extrinsic evidence. 2. Same — Interlineations.—Where the original transfer shows interlineations on its face, the date when they were made, and whether they were fraudulently made or not, are questions for the consideration of the jury; the transfer and record thereof being more than thirty years old. 3. Patent Issued to Wrong Person Invalid. — Where land is appropriated by a valid location and survey, and the patent therefor, by mistake, is issued to one having no right to the land, the patentee does not thereby acquire any title, and the patent is invalid. 4. Charge of Court — Special Instructions. — Where a requested instruction which might properly have been given is connected with propositions distinct in character, and which it would have been improper for the court to have submitted to the jury, the rejection of the entire instruction does not afford cause of complaint.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Action of trespass to try title for the recovery of 2312 acres of land out of the Roman de la Garza and the Fernando del Valle surveys, in Leon County, brought by the appellant. Defendants disclaimed as to 550 acres of said land, describing the same by metes and bounds, and as to the balance they pleaded not guilty and limitation of three, five, and ten years. W. M. Johnson and wife and others intervened and claimed title for themselves. Trial was had before the court without a jury, May 14, 1891, and judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants against the plaintiff and intervenors. Plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, and he now prosecutes this appeal. . Intervenors have not appealed. 1. Plaintiff’s title is derived from proceedings had in the Probate Court of Smith County, in the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, for the sale of the land in controvery as the property of said estate, for the pay*ment of a claim in favor of the heirs of N. G. Campbell, deceased. 2. On June 4, 1856, John D. Stell bought from Jesse Duren 3013 acres of land in Leon County, on the Trinity River, where he had a farm, and Duren executed to Mm a bond in the penal sum of $30,000, obligating himself to convey title as soon as the land could be “ surveyed and marked out and correctly designated.” The land in controversy is a part of this tract. 3. On November 22, 1859, Jesse Duren conveyed to John D. Stell, by deed filed for record August 1, 1860, and duly recorded in the record of deeds for Leon County, “ 5000 acres of land in Leon County, Texas, parts of the Roman de la Garza and Fernando del Yalle eleven league grants,” of which the 3013 acres above mentioned, and the land sued for, is a part. This deed is agreed to be common source. It is not set out in full, and the statement of it in the record does not show what the consideration for the land was, nor that a vendor’s lien was reserved to secure the purchase money. 4. John D. Stell sold the 5000 acres conveyed to him by Jesse Duren to J. H. Burnett and John F. Beavers, and conveyed the same to them by his deed, dated June 9, 1862, which was duly recorded in the record of deeds for Leon County. The statement of this deed given in the record does not show whether the purchase money was paid or not, and no vendor’s lien is reserved; but it appears from the testimony of John H. Burnett that the purchase money was not paid at the time. The land was sold to Burnett & Beavers at $3 per acre, and they at the same time bought negroes and stock and agricultural implements, making an aggregate of about $50,000, of which $1500 was paid in cash, and the balance was.evidenced by nine promissory notes for $5000 each, and one for $3500, from one to ten years after date. Beavers died before 1867, and Burnett became the executor of his will. 5. John D. Stell died October 28, 1862, leaving a will, which was probated in December, 1862, in the Probate Court of Smith County, and letters testamentary were granted to his brother, R. M. Stell, who was appointed executor by the will. Certain bequests were made in the will to the defendant Emily C. Clark and other children; and after providing for the payment of his just debts and said bequests, he provided for the remainder of the estate to be divided equally between his children, including his foster-son, John C. Cox, the son of his last wife, interveners to take share of their deceased father, James J. Stell. Mrs. Amanda Stell, wife of John D. Stell and mother of defendant Emily C. Clark, died January 17, 1862. She was the second wife of John D. Stell, and it was during his marriage with her that the land before mentioned was bought. The intervenors are the grandchildren of John D. Stell and the children of James J. Stell, a son of the first marriage. 6. On December 12, 1868, Elliott Shackelford, as administrator of N. G. Campbell, deceased, filed an application or petition in the Probate Court of Smith County, in the estate of John D. Stell, alleging that he was the legal holder and owner of a claim against the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, founded on two promissory notes executed by said John D. Stell, payable to Jesse Duren or bearer, dated June 4, 1856, due March 1, 1860 and 1861 respectively, which had been allowed by Robert M. Stell, the executor, on May 31, 1866, and approved by the chief justice of Smith County, and then amounted to the sum of $4112, principal and interest; that by reason of the approval of said claim it was established as a valid claim against said estate; and prayed that the administrator be ordered to pay the same. On July 26, 1869, R. M. Stell, the executor, filed an amended answer to said application, in which it was alleged, that Shackelford was not and never had been the owner of said notes, either in his own right or as administrator of the estate of N. G. Campbell, deceased; that the notes belonged to the estate of Jesse Duren, deceased, and were in the possession of Donley & Anderson, attorneys at law, for collection for the Duren estate, and had been fully paid off and satisfied, and were not a valid claim against the estate of John D. Stell. On the same day he filed an exhibit, in which, among other property, he returned as belonging to the estate about 4000 acres of land in Leon County, worth about $15,000; no money on hand; and valued assets of estate in his hands at $25,750. Said exhibit admits the acceptance and approval of the claim described in the application of Shackelford, but claimed that there should have been a credit thereon of $3000 in Confederate money, paid to Donley & Anderson, attorneys for W. H. Cundiff, administrator of the estate of Jesse Duren,"" deceased; also for a note of $150 against Jesse Duren; and finally settlement thereof with Duren’s administrator. On hearing the application of Elliott Shackelford for an order requiring the executor to pay said claim, the court rendered judgment on July 29, 1869, that the plaintiff take nothing by his suit, and that it be dismissed at plaintiff’s cost. Plaintiff excepted and gave notice of appeal to the District Court of Smith County. The judgment recites facts in support of the conclusion of the court, that the administrator had in evidence a receipt from Duren’s administrator showing payment of the notes to Cundiff, administrator of Duren, and an order on Donley & Anderson, attorneys, from Cundiff for the notes constituting the claim; and also payment in the way of other notes to Donley & Anderson, which were accepted as part payment; and also probate of the claim by Cundiff, Duren’s administrator, showing that the notes belonged to Duren’s estate,- and not to plaintiff. The court thereupon concluded that the possession • of the claim was not sufficient evidence of ownership. The only further action, except the orders of continuance, that appears to have been taken in the matter of the application of Elliott Shackelford against R. M. Stell, for the payment of said claim, is the following entry on the minutes of the District Court of Smith County: “_E. Shackelford, Administrator, v. R. M. Stell, Administrator. — Order of District Court, Smith County, Texas. — The appealed case of E. Shackelford v. R. M. Stell, No. 1577, to the Probate Docket.” Order made and dated July 28, 1873. 7. On the 7th day of December, 1870, B. F. Clark, the husband of the defendant Emily C. Clark, was appointed administrator of the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, with the will annexed. 8. On December 19, 1873, an order was made by the District Court of Smith County, in the succession of John D. Stell, deceased, in the matter of the petition of E. Shackelford, administrator of the estate of N. G. Campbell, deceased, for an order to sell land, requiring B. F. Clark, administrator of said estate, to sell 2000 acres of land, to be selected by him out of the survey lying in Leon County, known as the land granted to Roman de la Garza, and inventoried in said succession. The order recited that a necessity for said sale existed to pay the established indebtedness of the estate; and the administrator was ordered to report at the next term of the court. 9. The sale appeal’s to have been made and reported to the court, for on September 25, 1874, there was an order of the court, made by consent of parties, setting aside the sale, as shown in the report of sale filed September 23, 1874. 10. On June 30, 1876, the administration of the said estate was transferred to the County Court by a general order of the District Court.- 11. The heirs of Amanda Stell brought a suit in the District Court of Smith County, styled No. 2160, John C. Cox et al. v. B. F. Clark, administrator, et al., for the partition of 4460 acres of land in Leon County, Texas, belonging to the John D. Stell estate, and by decree of court, March 13, 1879, 2312 acres was set apart to them, being the same land described in plaintiff’s petition, and in controversy in this suit. The defendants in said partition suit were the heirs of John D. Stell by his first wife, and John H. Burnett. The memorandum decree in the record does not show whether or not Burnett was sued also in his capacity as executor of the will of Beavers. It states that suit was also against creditors of said estate, but no names of creditors are given. 12. Defendant Emily C. Clark entered into possession in the year 1879 of the 2312 acres above mentioned as having been set apart to the heirs of Amanda Stell by the decree of partition in the District Court of Smith County, and claimed the entire tract, except the 550 acres, as to which she disclaimed, having bought out the interests of her cotenants with her separate money, and paid taxes thereon every year from 1880 up to the time of the trial, and had held continuous possession thereof ever since 1879, holding and claiming it in her own separate right. 13. On April 5, 1880, A. J. Swan qualified as administrator of the said estate of John D. Stell, deceased. 14. R. M. Stell, executor of the will of John D.'Stell, brought suit in the District Court of Houston County against John II. Burnett, in his individual capacity and as executor of the will of John F. Beavers, deceased, on the notes executed for the property, including the land in Leon County, 5000 acres, purchased by Burnett & Beavers from John D. Stell; and on April 1, 1867, judgment was rendered in favor of said R. M. Stell as executor of John D. Stell, by confession, for the sum of $28,-205, with foreclosure of the vendor’s lien on the land conveyed to Burnett & Beavers. 15. Certified copies of returns of sheriff of Leon County on orders of sale issued on said judgment, August 1, 1881, and October 26, 1881, were put in evidence, which showed: (1) Return on order of sale issued August 1, 1881, returnable September 1, 1881, by order of A. J. Swan, administrator de bonis non of the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, upon suit of R. M. Stell, executor, v. John H. Burnett, executor, shows that the writ came to hand August 5, 1881, and was executed August 6, 1881, by levying on the land described in the judgment, and was returned for want of time to execute the same. (2) Return on order of sale issued October 26, 1881, returnable to the next term of the District Court of Houston County, shows that same came to the hands of the sheriff of Leon County on November 18, 1881, and was levied on said land, which was advertised for sale on Tuesday, December 6, 1881, and that said land was sold to A. J. Swan, administrator, for use of estate of John D. Stell, deceased, for the sum of $1000. Neither of the above mentioned writs were put in evidence. 16. J. N. Black, sheriff of Leon County, executed deed to A. J. Swan for the land, in accordance with sale as shown above, dated December 6, 1881, which was properly acknowledged and recorded. 17. On February 1, 1883, N. Campbell and others, as the only heirs at law of N. G-. Campbell, filed an application in the County Court of Smith County in the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, praying for an order of sale to sell lands belonging to said estate situated in Leon County, to satisfy two notes held by them, executed by John D. Stell to Jesse Duren, for the sum of $2000 each, dated June 4, 1856, payable to Jesse Duren or bearer on the 1st day of March, 1860 and 1861, respectively, with two credits endorsed by Jesse Duren, viz., November 22, 1859, $521, and January 4, 1864, $1000. They alleged that the claim for said notes was presented to R. M. Stell, as executor, for his acceptance thereof, on May 13, 1866, and that it was accepted, less a further credit of $324.34, leaving a balance due them of $3410.62; that on May 8, 1867, said claim was approved by the county judge for the amount allowed by the executor; that said notes were given for a part of the purchase money of the land in Leon County, 5000 acres, which was fully described, and prayed for an order to sell the same. 18. On May 12, 1884, the County Court of Smith County entered an order decreeing the sale of said land and the application of the proceeds of the sale to the payment of said claim, and that the administrator make report to the next term of the court. An order renewing said order of sale was made August 18, 1884. 19. A report of sale of said land was filed in said estate January 1, 1885, and order confirming the same was made January 19, 1885. The sale was shown to have been made on the first Tuesday in November, 1884, and the heirs, N. Campbell and others, became the purchasers. 20. The administrator, A. J. Swan, executed a deed in conformity with the order of the court for the land, 5000 acres, in consideration of the bid, $1300, to Mary Ann Crow, Emeline Chancellor, Delilah Boles, H. N. Campbell, Amanda Nichols, N. Campbell, and E. Campbell. Said deed was dated April 30, 1885, and conveyed the land above mentioned, being the same described in the deed from Duren to Stell in the judgment in Stell against Burnett, and in the application for sale and in the orders of the court directing and confirming sale. 21. A regular chain of title was shown from the grantees in the administrator’s deed conveying the land to the plaintiff, A. B. Hardin. 22. Mary Ann Crow, Emeline Chancellor, Delilah Boles, and Amanda Nichols were married women and under coverture from sometime before the defendant, Mrs. Clark, took possession of the land in 1879 until after their sale thereof. They sold, joined by their cotenants, first, an undivided one-half of the land on September 22, 1886, to John L. Henry, H. Gr. Robertson, and N. W. Finley; and afterwards, on July 18, 1889, by their attorney in fact, E. Campbell, and joined by Henry, Robertson, and Finley, who conveyed their one-half, they sold their remaining interest to plaintiff, A. B. Hardin. 23. It was not shown when or how N. Gr. Campbell came into possession of the claim for the payment of which the land was sold. It was never established by the court as a lien on the land. 24. It was shown that the defendant, Emily C. Clark, and other devisees and legatees in the will of John D. Stell, accepted the provision made for them in the will. 25. The judgment in favor of R. M. Stell, executor of the will of John D. Stell, deceased, against John H. Burnett, rendered in the District Court of Houston County, April 1, 1867, foreclosing a lien on the 5000 acres of land purchased by Burnett & Beavers from John D. Stell, was settled about December, 1868, and the land was reconveyed by Burnett to the executor of R. M. Stell. Cbnclusio?is of law —1. Since the judgment in favor of R. M. Stell, executor, against John H. Burnett, foreclosing the vendor’s lien on the land, had been already settled, it would not support an order of sale or execution, and the sale by the sheriff of Leon County and his deed to A. J. Swan as the administrator of the estate of John D. Stell, deceased, were nullities; and said estate would have acquired no title to the land by virtue of said sale, even if an execution had been shown by which the sheriff was authorized to make the sale. Delivered December 22, 1892. 2. Whether or not the defendant Emily C. Clark acquired a valid title as against the creditors of the estate of John D. Stell, by the judgment in the suit brought by her and other heirs of her mother Amanda Stell, deceased, against B. F. Clark, the administrator, and John H. Burnett and the heirs of John D. Stell by his first wife, it is not necessary to inquire, for she had a judgment against the administrator for the land, and took possession thereof, claiming the same adversely to the estate, and her title to the land became perfect by the statute of ten years limitation. 3. Mrs. Clark’s possession of the land might not have been considered adverse to the right of the estate to have the land sold under the judgment in favor of the estate against Burnett, foreclosing the vendor’s lien thereon; and if such sale had been valid, limitation might not have commenced to run until from the date of the sale, but as such sale was invalid, and said land was the property of the estate at the time it was set apart to the defendant in the partition suit, limitation commenced to run from the time that Mrs. Clark entered into possession, which was in 1879, soon after the partition had been made. 4. The claim for the payment of which the land was sold was never established as a lien thereon, and it was not shown that the notes upon which it was founded were ever executed for the purchase money, as contended by appellant; hence Mrs. Clark did not hold the land in subordination to a lien for the payment of the claim, and there was nothing to prevent the running of the statute in her favor. 5. Whatever cause of action the heirs of N. Gf. Campbell may have had for the land in controversy only accrued at the date of the acquisition of their title at the administrator’s sale, which was made on the first Tuesday in November, 1884, and confirmed January 19, 1885, and the deed executed April 30, 1885. Mrs. Clark was in possession then, and the cause of action having accrued subsequent to the commencement of the running of the statute in her favor, the coverture of the heirs who were married is no answer to proof of limitation. The judgment of the court below will be affirmed. Affirmed.","A. B. Hardin v. Emily C. Clark and Husband. No. 52. 1. Sale Under a Paid Judgment Void. — A judgment which has been paid will not support an order of sale or execution, and a sale under it would he a nullity, and a purchaser thereunder would acquire no title to the land by virtue of the sale. 2. Prom What Date Adverse Possession Runs. — Possession taken of land under decree in a partition suit against the administrator of the estate to which it belonged, would not be adverse to the right of the estate to have the land sold under a judgment foreclosing a vendor’s lien thereon, prior in date to the partition decree under which the party in possession held: and though limitation might not commence to run in such case until the date of the vendor’s lien judgment sale, yet if such sale was invalid and the land was the property of the estate when partitioned and set aside to the possessor, limitation would run from the date of such possession under partition. 3. Vendor’s Lien Not Expressly Retained. — It did not appear that the notes upon which the judgment was rendered and the land sold were executed for the purchase money of the land, nor were they ever established by allowance and approval as a lien thereon; hence the party in possession under the partition decree did not hold in subordination to a lien for purchase money, and there was nothing to prevent the running of the statute in her favor. 4. Disabilities, when Unavailing — Mrs. Clark went into possession in 1879. The cause of action of the N. G. Campbell heirs accrued at the date of their acquisition of title at administrator’s sale, which was confirmed January 19, 1885. They were married women prior to 1879, and parted with their title to one-half the land in 1886, and the other half in 1889. and the plaintiff held under them by regular chain of title. Their cause of action having accrued subsequent to the commencement of the. running of the statute in Mrs. Clark's favor, the coverture of the heirs of Campbell is no answer to the plea of limitation. Appeal from Leon. Tried below before Hon. Norman G-. Kittrell. Adams & Adams, Gammage & Gammage, and J. J. Dotson, for appellants. The judgment of partition in this case is conclusive against the parties to the suit, but can not affect the Campbell heirs, from whom plaintiff deraigns title, because they were at the time claiming rights in the property involved, and were not made parties to the partition suit.

Stell’s representative against Burnett & Beavers is nugatory so far as shown by the record; first, because the judgment had been settled and discharged; second, because it was barred by limitation, if not otherwise shown paid; third, because no execution or other lawful authority is shown for a sale under such judgment; fourth, because Burnett & Beavers did not have the title to the land at time of pretended sale, and the property had been treated as reverted to the Stell estate, and held in administration in Smith County as property of J. D. Stell’s estate for ten or fifteen years before such pretended sale. Howard v. North, 5 Texas, 306; Sydnor v. Roberts, 13 Texas, 615; Coffee v. Silvan, 15 Texas, 362; Criswell v.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. Plaintiffs, H. M. Patterson, J. B. Shields, and W. ICeesey, in their corporate capacity as district trustees of district number 1, and county of Jeff Davis, State of Texas, brought this suit to restrain W. W. Wimberly, county judge of Jeff Davis County, and his successors in office, from apportioning to school district number 2 the sum of $25.98, and all other available school funds to which district number 1 would thereafter be entitled as the pro rata of said funds for the children within scholastic age residing upon the A. S. Lewis survey. The school trustees of district number 2, being parties in interest in their corporate capacity, were made parties defendant. Plaintiffs in their petition allege, that for about two years prior to the 26th day of March, 1889, Jeff Davis County had been divided into two school districts. In pursuance of an expressed desire of a majority of the voters of the two districts, the Commissioners Court at a special term, on the 26th day of March, 1889, recfistricted said county, and by orders duly entered on the minutes of the court, created three school districts, defined them by boundaries, and numbered them 1, 2, and 3, respectively; and that on the 14th day of August, 1¿89, the court, without having obtained the consent of the voters of districts numbers 1 and 2, and in violation of the law, changed the lines between the two districts so as to detach from district number 1 the A. S. Lewis survey number 6 and attach it to district number 2. Defendant Wimberly recognized the change made by the court, and apportioned the pro rata of the school fund for the children residing on the Lewis survey to district number 2. This survey is very populous on account of the military post at Fort Davis being located on it; it contains 640 acres of land, and the number of children residing on it and enrolled in district number 1 for the year 1889-90 was twenty-seven. At the time of commencing this suit there was about to be paid into the county treasury the sum of 8774.90, available school fund for the county for the year 1889-90. Of this sum plaintiffs allege that $25.90 was due and should be apportioned to district number 1 as the pro rata of said fund for ten of the children residing on the Lewis survey, and not theretofore transferred to district number 2 by defendant Wimberly, and that unless restrained from so doing, Wimberly would apportion this sum to district number 2, and would apportion all other school funds to which district number 1 was entitled as the pro rata of the children within scholastic age residing on the Lewis survey. Defendants answered by general denial, and by special plea, that the county was redistricted on the 26th of March, 1889, only for the purpose of giving the town of ""Valentine and surrounding country better school facilities; that the Lewis survey had prior to this time been in district number 2; that the duty of designating the boundaries was by the court entrusted to one of the commissioners, a surveyor by profession, and that he availed himself of his superior knowledge of the boundary lines between the various tracts of land, and with intent to deceive the court, changed the lines between districts numbers 1 and 2 as they had formerly existed, and detached the Lewis survey from district number 2 and attached it to district number 1, and thereby deceived three of the commissioners; that on the 28th day of March, and before the adjournment of the term of court, an order was passed by the court to reconsider its action in designating the boundaries between districts numbers 1 and 2, and on the 13th day of August, 1889, in pursuance of the order to reconsider, changed the line between districts numbers 1 and 2 so as to include the Lewis survey in district number 2, where it was intended in the order of March 26, 1889, it should be. The case was tried before the court, and resulted in a judgment for the defendants dissolving the injunction, and for costs. We find the facts to be as follows: 1. That prior to March 15, 1889, the county of Jeff Davis was divided into two school districts, which were numbered 1 and 2. 2. That on March 16, 1889, an election was held to change these two districts and redistrict the county; that in this election a majority of all the legal voters in all the districts voted in favor of changing and redistricting. 3. On March 19 the County Commissioners Court of Jeff Davis County canvassed the result of the election, and ascertained by a count of the votes that a majority of all the voters in all the districts to be affected had voted in favor of changing and redistricting, and so declared in their order entered of record on said date. 4. In pursuance of the result of the election above mentioned, the County Commissioners Court on March 26, 1889, changed the old districts and redistricted the county into three districts, and numbered them 1,2, and 3, and prescribed the metes and bounds of each district as the law required; and in the order establishing the metes and bounds of these three districts, survey number 6 was included in district number 1. 5. That before the change and redistricting said survey number 6 had always been in district number 2, and the county judge and three of the commissioners were not aware that by the change it was taken from number 2 and placed in number 1. Nor was it their desire or intention that it should be changed from district number 2 to district number 1. 6. The county commissioners ascertaining that survey 6 had been changed from district number 2 into district number 1, on March 28, 1889 (two days after entering the order establishing the metes and bounds of the three districts, and at the same term that order was entered, and before the minutes had been approved), the court passed an order reconsidering the order by which the boundaries had been established between districts 1 and 2. 7. In pursuance of the order reconsidering the order establishing the boundaries between districts 1 and 2, the county commissioners, at their session on August 14, 1889, established the boundary lines between districts 1 and 2 so as to place survey number 6 in district number 2, where it had always been before, and where the county judge and three commissioners intended it to be and thought it was. 8. At the time the order was passed on March 28, 1889, reconsidering the order passed on March 26, 1889, defining the boundaries of the school districts, there were present the county judge, Wimberly, and three commissioners. 9. The copies of the proceedings and orders of the Commissioners Court recite that Commissioners Dawson, Grierson, and Thompson were present on said 28th day of March, 1889, and'is silent as to who else was present. 10. The county judge, Wimberly, testified that he was present at said time and acted with the three commissioners in holding court, but did not vote on the question of reconsidering the order made on March 26, 1889. The first error assigned complains of the evidence of County Judge Wimberly, showing that he was present and formed a part of the Commissioners Court on the 28th day of March, 1889, when the order reconsidering the order made on March 26, establishing the boundaries of the school districts, was passed, for the reason that this fact could only be shown by the minutes of the court, and that paroi evidence for this purpose was not admissible. The evidence objected to did not tend to contradict the record, but was simply explanatory of it. The minutes of the court for that day simply showed that three commissioners, naming them, were present, but did not say that any one else required by law as necessary to constitute a part of the court was not present. The failure of the record of the proceedings of the Commissioners Court to state that the county judge Was present was evidently an oversight of the clerk in preparing the minutes of the court. The evidence was properly admitted. The county judge being present with the three commissioners, constituted a full court for the transaction of business as required by law. The two comissioners having voted for the proposition to reconsider the previous order fixing the boundaries of the several districts, it was not necessary that the county judge should cast his vote in order to give the vote validity. The court had the right at the same session to change its orders made at that term of the court. This disposes of all the assignments of error. We find no error in the record, and affirm the judgment. Affirmed. Delivered February 1, 1893.","District School Trustees, etc., v. W. W. Wimberly. No. 68. 1. Parol Evidence—Minutes of County Commissioners Court.— The minutes of the County Commissioners Court not showing that the county judge was present, it was competent to prove his presence by paroi testimony. The minutes recited that three commissioners were present, and were silent as to the county judge. 2. County Commissioners Court—Setting Aside Former Order. It is within the jurisdiction of the County Commissioners Court to set aside a former order made at the same term. 3. County Commissioners Court—Quorum.—The minutes recited the presence of three commissioners. It was further shown that the county judge was also present. Held, such parties constituted a full court for the transaction of business. 4. Action of Commissioners Constitutes Act of Court.—The vote of two of the three commissioners present for an order rescinding a former order made during the term constituted an act of the court, without the vote of the county judge. So held on a vote reconsidering an order redistricting the county into school districts. Appeal from Jeff Davis. Tried below, before Hon. Winchester Kelso. W. O. Reid, for appellants. 1. If the county judge was present in the court and acting with the three commissioners when the motion to reconsider was made and voted on, and the minutes of the court fail to show that he was then present, this fact could only be proved by the minutes of the court after the same had been corrected upon application to the court for that purpose.

In the absence of the county judge from the Commissioners Court, no less than the four commissioners constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The minutes showing no legal quorum present in the Commissioners Court of Jeff Davis County when the motion to reconsider was made and voted on, the action of the three commissioners was void, and no legal order to reconsider was made. West v. Burke, 60 Texas, 51. 3. If a quorum of the Commissioners Court was present on the 28th day of March, 1889, a majority of the court present and acting did not vote for the motion, and no valid or legal order to reconsider the boundaries between districts numbers 1 and and 2 was made by the court. Lawrence v. Ingersoll, 12 S. W. Rep., 422. Walter Gillis and W. W. Turney, for appellee. 1. When the minutes of the court had stated that three commissioners were present on the 28th day of March, 1889, and were silent as to the presence of a presiding officer, and the proof of such presence being essential to the validity of the orders passed, it was not error to admit paroi proof to show that the presiding officer was present and acting with the court; and the failure of the clerk to note the presence of any member, or the whole of the court, would not affect the validity of acts done by the court, if its acts were otherwise regular. 2. On the 28th day of March, 1889, the Commissioners Court of Jeff Davis County was a lawful one, being composed of a county judge and three commissioners; and the fact that the minutes of said court failed to state just who of the members of said court were present and who were not, does not vitiate the acts of said court."
"HEAD, Associate Justice. In April, 1879, the land in controversy being vacant public domain, one William Hutton settled thereon and made such improvements as entitled him to be classed as an actual settler under the Act of May 26,1873. Hutton remained upon the land until in the summer of 1881, when on account of the excessively dry weather he moved his family with his flock of sheep about eight miles, to obtain water, and never afterward returned thereto with his family, although a part of his furniture remained in the house until the summer or fall of 1882, and the forage for his stock which was raised on the place in 1881 remained thereon. In July, 1880, Hutton made application in writing to the proper surveyor to have this land surveyed for him as a pre-emptian homestead, but this application was not accompanied with an affidavit as required by law. The surveyor, however, surveyed the land and returned the field notes with this application to the Land Office in August, 1880. In November, 1883, Hutton filed his own and two supporting affidavits, proving three years occupancy by him as required by law, with the Commissioner of the General Land Office. In May, 1883, Hutton, joined by his wife, conveyed all his interest in the land in controversy to appellant, who has never resided upon it. In February, 1890, appellees settled upon different parts of this land for the purpose of acquiring preemption homesteads thereon. They made the necessary applications and affidavits, and had the survey made and the field notes returned to the General Land Office in compliance with the law to entitle them to the land, if at that time it was vacant public domain. In 1884, appellant applied to the Commissioner of the General Land Office for patent on the I-Iutton claim, and was informed that this land was embraced in an older survey, and as appellant was then the owner of such older survey, he made no further effort to procure the patent until after the settlement by, and the surveys for, appellees were made; but when he learned of this adverse claim, he again applied to the Commissioner for a patent, which was issued in the name of William Hutton, on the 8th day of August, 1890. The field notes of appellees’ surveys were filed in the General Land Office July 11, 1890. The case was tried by the court below without a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of appellees for that part of the land covered by their claims, and in favor of appellant for the remainder. No special findings of law or fact accompany the record. At the time appellees made their settlement, the land was enclosed in the pasture of appellant, and they were notified by him that he claimed it under the Hutton settlement. There being no special findings of fact in the record, we think the judgment rendered by the court below must be held to import a finding that I-Iutton’s application was not accompanied by the necessary affidavit to authorize a survey for him under the pre-emption laws in force at the time of such application. That the failure to accompany his application with such an affidavit is fatal to the claim of appellant, seems to be settled by the decisions of our Supreme Court. Miller v. Moss, 65 Texas, 179; Bledsoe v. Cains, 10 Texas, 455; 1 Sayles’ Real Estate Laws of Texas, sec. 322. Appellant contends, that under the evidence the court should have presumed that the necessary application and affidavit were made by Hutton. It is true that Hutton swears that he made an application and had a survey made in 1879, and it may be that had the court found in favor of appellant, we would have been constrained to hold that the evidence justified such finding; but the court having taken a different view of the evidence, and, as we must presume, having found .that the only application that was made was the one returned to the Land Office in 1880, and that this application was not accompanied by the necessary affidavit, we must hold that such finding was justified by the evidence in support of the judgment rendered. We are also not prepared to say that a finding by the court below that Hutton had permanently abandoned the place before he had occupied it the full three years would not be sustained by the evidence. It is true that a mere temporary absence would not work a forfeiture of such a claim (Bledsoe v. Cains, supra; Calvert v. Ramsey, 59 Texas, 490); but it may be that the court viewed the evidence in this case as showing an intention on the part of Hutton not again to make his-home upon this land; and if such was the finding, we would hardly be-be authorized to disturb the judgment. Let the judgment of the court below be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 31, 1893.","R. O. Prideaux v. W. L. Glasgow et al. No. 86. 1. Pre-emption Homestead—Affidavit Necessary to Application for.—An application for the survey of a pre-emption homestead claim on vacant public domain is fatally defective if not accompanied by the affidavit required by law. 2. Same — Abandonment of Residence upon.—See opinion for evidence that would sustain a finding that a pre-emption homestead settler had abandoned the land without an intention to again make his home thereon. 3. Practice on Appeal — Presumptions where no Special Findings by Trial Court.—Where the trial below is by the court alone, without any special findings of fact or law in the record, it will be presumed on appeal that the court did find the facts to be such as authorized the judgment, if there was evidence warranting such finding, even though there was other evidence that might have sustained a different finding.

"PER CURIAM. The appellees in this case recovered a judgment against the appellants in the District Court of Anderson County, on the 23rd day of November, 1891, to which judgment the appellants, who were defendants in the court below, excepted and gave notice of appeal to the Supreme Court. On the 6th day of January, 1892, the defendants perfected their appeal by filing a proper appeal bond. The appeal was returnable to the Tyler Term of the Supreme Court, which would have commenced, as the law then stood, on the first Monday in October, 1892; and the appellants would have had until the first day of the assignment, during said term, to which Anderson County belonged in which to file the transcript in the Supreme Court. The transcript was not filed in the Supreme Court and has not been filed in this court. On September 1, 1892, the law took effect establishing the Courts of Civil Appeals. Section 3 of an act to amend the law governing the practice in the District and County Courts, passed at the late special session of the Legislature, to conform it to the law establishing the Courts of Civil Appeals, approved April 13, 1892, provides: 11 That all appeals and writs of error taken and perfected from any District or County Court to the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals, before the taking effect of this act, shall be returnable to the Courts of Civil Appeals under the provisions of this act, and shall be decided under the same rules as if they had been so perfected after this law shall take effect.” Delivered November 17, 1892. Section 20 of the act creating the Courts of Civil Appeals reads: “In any appeal or writ of error as provided for in this act, the appellant or plaintiff in error shall file the transcript with the clerk of the Court of Civil Appeals within ninety days from the perfecting of the appeal or service of the writ of error; provided, for good cause shown, the court may permit the transcript to be thereafter filed upon such terms as it may prescribe.” If the appellant should fail to file a transcript of the record as directed, then the appellee may have the judgment of the court below affirmed on certificate. Law Spec. Sess. Leg., 1892, 28. In the absence of any specific provision of the law as to when the record shall be filed in cases in which the appeal has been perfected in the District or County Court for more than ninety days before the Courts of Civil Appeals were organized, we must look to the entire law on the subject, and determine, if we can, what the practice should be. To require the record to be filed within ninety days from the time when the appeal was perfected to the Supreme Court, would defeat the right of appeal, as that time had expired when the Courts of Civil Appeals were organized. We think that a reasonable construction of the law would be, that the appeal became perfected to this court on the day that the act establishing the Courts of Civil Appeals took effect, and that the appellants would have ninety days from that date, September 1, 1892, within which to file the transcript of the record in this court. As that time has not yet expired, the motion to affirm the judgment of the court below, on certificate, will be overruled. Motion overruled.","F. A. Weidemeyer et al. v. B. F. and W. Broyles.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This suit was brought by the heirs of S. Rhoads Fisher, to recover of the appellee, W. B. Hoskins, one-third of a league of land situated in Brazoria County, patented to Hiram H. Russell, March 17, 1875. Plaintiffs claimed title under an alleged transfer of the certificate by virtue of which the land was located to S. Rhoads Fisher, to whom they showed heirship. Defendant pleaded not guilty, and on the trial deraigned title from a junior transfer of the certificate, which was no doubt made under a forged power of attorney. Defendant pleaded also limitations of three, five, and ten years; also stale demand and estoppel. On the trial below the plaintiffs offered in evidence an instrument in writing, under which they claimed title to the certificate, purporting to have been executed by Hiram H. Russell and witnessed by E. M. Pease and H. C. Hudson. It was dated July 26, 1836, and attached thereto is the certificate of A. Brigham, first auditor in the Treasury Department of Texas, made on said date at Velasco, which recited, that before him, “ for the want of a judge or notary public, there being neither in this place, personally appeared Hiram H. Russell, who declared that the above is his true signature,” and also that it was attested in his presence by E. M. Pease and H. C. Hudson. Said instrument was endorsed, “ Filed 4th October, 1836. E. H. Winfield, clerk D. C. B.” It was also filed for record in the record of deeds for Brazoria County, August 30, 1887, and then recorded; and again, on proof made by the affidavit of H. Masterson, dated June 23, 1891, to the handwriting of E. M. Pease, and that the grantor and grantee were dead, and the other witness, H. C. Hudson, he verily believed to be dead, the instrument was filed for record June 23, 1891, and admitted to record on July 4, 1891, in said record of deeds. Plaintiffs also offered, in connection with said instrument, evidence of the genuineness of the signature of the subscribing witness E. M. Pease; and- also the early records of Brazoria county, to show that E. H. Win-field was clerk of the court in Brazoria in 1836 or 1837; and evidence that said instrument was found in the county clerk’s office in Brazoria County; that in the place where it was found there were papers of like character—Spanish records and the like. There is also evidence in the statement of facts that the instrument was found by plaintiffs’ attorney in a package of old deeds, in a place in the office where ancient documents were kept, during the year 1886 or early in the year 1887; also-tending to show that the grantor in said instrument, S. Rhoads Fisher, had possession of the certificate, and that it was claimed to be the property of the estate of said Fisher, and was lost. The original instrument has been sent up with the transcript for the inspection of the court. It bears every evidence of antiquity, and appears to be a genuine document. It is as follows: “ To all whom it may concern: Be it known and made manifest, that I, Hiram H. Russell, residing in the Republic of Texas, being fully entitled by law as a citizen and settler, furthermore as a member of the New Orleans Volunteer Greys, having been concerned in the capture of San Antonio at the commencement of the present war, to one unlocated third of a league of land in Texas; and whereas, by the general provision of the Constitution of Texas any citizen is permitted to transfer his headright or other right to land by bargain, sale, or' exchange, and in such case the person to whom such right shall have been transferred shall be entitled to the same as fully and completely as the person making the transfer might or could have been; now therefore, for and in consideration of the sum of 8100, the receipt whereof I hereby acknowledge, I do hereby grant, bargain, sell, and transfer unto S. Rhoads Fisher, a citizen of Texas, all my right, title, and interest in and to the above mentioned portion of land not yet located; and I do, for myself, my heirs, executors, and administrators, warrant and defend the right and - title herein transferred unto the said Fisher, his heirs and assigns, forever; hereby granting him and all who shall claim under him full and irrevocable power to locate, take formal possession of, and complete the title to the same, in my name or in his own name, according as may be most proper and legal in the full and complete securing of the same unto the said Fisher, his heirs, and assigns, together with all other rights and privileges which in any case may be requisite and necessary for the absolute ownership and enjoyment of said third of a league; and for the further stability of this instrument, I do by these presents renounce the benefit of all laws or parts of laws which may or can affect the validity or intention of this complete and absolute transfer. “ In faith whereof, I have hereunto affixed my hand and seal, this 26th day of July, A. D. 1836, town of Velasco. his [Signed] “ Hiram H. + Russell. mark “Witness: “ E. M. Pease, “H. C. Hudson.” On the objection of defendant, the court excluded the instrument from the consideration of the jury, and instructed them to return a verdict for the defendant. In terms the instrument was sufficient to transfer the title to the certificate, and consequently, upon its location, the title to the land. As an ancient document, it would be sufficient if there was evidence to show that it came from proper custody, because it appears to be free from suspicion and is over thirty years old. All the evidence as to the custody is, that by some means the deed was deposited by some one with the clerk of Brazoria County, probably at the date of the file mark thereon, and was found in the clerk’s office in an old package of deeds, in 1886 or in 1887. It would not be necessary for the instrument to come from the possession or custody of the grantee, but it must be shown to have come from a proper depository. 1 Whart. on Ev., 194. At the time of the execution of the instrument the land had not been located, and there was no occasion for the deposit thereof with the clerk of the Brazoria court. We do not think that the evidence was sufficient to support the transfer as an ancient instrument. It was also never properly of record, and was not admissible as a recorded instrument. But there is a distinction to be observed between the proof of an instrument for record under the registration laws, and the proof of the execution of an instrument when offered in evidence on the trial of a cause. In the latter case the proof must be made by the production of the subscribing witnesses, or one of them, if any, if he be living; but if the subscribing witnesses be dead or incompetent to testify, or can not be procured, and in other like cases, then secondary evidence of its execution is admissible, as this proof is made by proof of the handwriting of the subscribing witnesses. Cairrell v. Higgs, 1 Posey’s U. C., 56; 1 Whart. on Ev., secs. 726, 1359. The nonproduction of the witnesses should be accounted for by the party offering the deed; but after the lapse of thirty years the death of the witnesses will be presumed. The affidavit of Masterson, attached to the transfer, of the death of the witnesses and of the handwriting of E. M. Pease was not properly evidence; but it is stated in the bill of exceptions, that the instrument was offered with evidence of the genuineness of the signature of E. M. Pease. This, under the circumstances, was sufficient proof of the execution of the transfer for its admission in evidence before the jury, and the court erred in excluding it. Appellee contends, that the case was virtually tried by the court, and that there was a finding against the execution of the instrument after the hearing of all the evidence by the court, and that the case should now be so considered by this court, and the finding of the court below sustained. The bill of exception states, that “ the court excluded said instrument of transfer from the evidence, and refused to permit it to be read to the jury for any purpose, and instructed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant.” We do not feel authorized to deprive the plaintiffs of the right of trial of the issue by a jury, and shall reverse and remand the case. Defendant’s pleas and proof of limitations were met by plea and proof of coverture and minority on the part of most of the plaintiffs, and the judgment can not be affirmed on the ground of limitations. The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 2, 1893.","Annie P. Harris et al. v. W. D. Hoskins. No. 105. 1. Proof of Execution of an Instrument over Thirty Years Old. An original transfer of an unlocated land certificate, dated July 26,1836, bearing every appearance of antiquity and genuineness, though it does not come from the proper custody to be admissible as an ancient instrument, may be read in evidence by proving the handwriting of one of the subscribing witnesses, and that they are dead; and after the lapse of thirty years their death will be presumed. 2. Ancient Instrument—Proper Custody.—An instrument over thirty years old, which comes from the custody of the county clerk, but when it was filed with him there was no occasion for its deposit there, as the certificate it purported to transfer had not yet been located, does not come from the proper custody to admit it in evidence as an ancient instrument. Appeal from Brazoria. Tried below before Hon. William H. Burk-hart. H. Masterson and Branch T. Masterson, for appellants. 1. The land certificate issued to Hiram H. Russell was, up to the time of its location, personal property, susceptible of being sold as other personal property, by paroi, and the fact of sale could be established by facts and circumstances; and the paper transfer was admissible in evidence as an item of evidence in connection with the other testimony in the case as tending to show the ownership of the certificate in S. Rhoads Fisher, and should have been allowed to go to the jury. Watkins v. Gilkerson, 10 Texas, 340; Cox v. Bray, 28 Texas, 261; Evans v. Hardeman, 15 Texas, 481; Stone v. Brown, 54 Texas, 334; Miller v. Roberts, 18 Texas, 19; Peevy v. Hurt, 32 Texas, 150. 2. The land certificate sold by Hiram H. Russell to S. Rhoads Fisher being personal property, the assignment of it, although in writing, was not required by law to be recorded until it merged into real property by the location of it on the land in suit. The only question to be considered in determining its admissibility in evidence was the proof of its execution; and even this was unnecessary after it was authenticated for record in the mode pointed out by the statute, and duly recorded, as in this case. Simpson v. Chapman, 45 Texas, 566; Hearne v. Gillett, 62 Texas, 23; Holmes v. Coryell, 58 Texas, 686; Adams v. Railway, 70 Texas, 275. 3. The transfer from Hiram H. Russell being over thirty years of age, was admissible in evidence as an ancient instrument without proof of its execution. Ballard v. Carmichael, 83 Texas, 365; Holmes v.

Eugene J. Wilson, for appellee. 1. The instrument on its face being only a transfer of a “right ” to a land certificate, is a stale demand, more than fifty years having elapsed before its attempted enforcement, and the judge had the right to so construe it under the submission to him.

The issuance of the original headright certificate by the Board of Land Commissioners of San Augustine County to Hiram H. Russell in his name, on February 1, 1838, was such an act of repudiation of the alleged contract or transfer of said Russell’s right to Fisher as to set limitation in motion."
