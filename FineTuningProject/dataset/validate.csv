"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This appeal is from a verdict and judgment in favor of the surving wife and children of Newton R. Roberts, who was killed on the 24th of November, 1888, by one of appellant’s •north bound passenger trains, within the corporate limits of Queen City, in Cass County, about 125 yards south of a public crossing, on or near a pathway usually travelled by footmen, and sometimes by persons on horseback, which ran diagonally across appellant’s railway track. The evidence tended to show that deceased had entered upon the track at the public crossing, which was a wagon road, and had gone down the track, riding a mule, to about the place where he was killed. That this occurred about fifteen minutes before the train was in sight, and that the homicide occurred about thirty minutes after sundown. At this point the railway 'track was on an embankment about 10 or 12 feet high, and the deceased, when killed and for several minutes before the train was in sight, was engaged in trying, in vain, to lead his mule off the track and down the embankment, and seems to have been entirely unconscious of the approaching train. The evidence tended to show that the track was straight for several hundred yards south of this point, and that in approaching, deceased the train was running up grade, and the witnesses vary in their estimates of its rate of speed from 15 to 35 miles per hour. The deceased seems to have been on his way from Queen City to Atlanta, a distance of two or three miles; and the evidence was conflicting •as to whether or not he was drunk at the time of the homicide. It was .also conflicting as to the distance he could have been seen by the engineer just before he was killed; the train men claiming that they did not see him and could not have seen him at a greater distance than 150 feet on account of the darkness, other eye-witnesses testifying that he could have been seen as much as 400 yards away. There was also a conflict as to the time when the bell rang and the whistle blew; one witness testifying that it occurred at the very time of the killing, others testifying that it occurred when the train was from 35 to 175 yards distant. There was also a planing mill 30 or 40 yards east of the place of the accident, though there were no other houses nearer than about 200 yards. The evidence was conflicting as to the distance the train was from the deceased when he was first discovered by the train men, varying from 35 to 175 yards, and was susceptible of different constructions as to the time the air brakes were applied. The proof tended to show that the train, if running at 35 miles per hour, could have been stopped within 400 feet, and within about half that distance if running at 15 or 20 miles per hour. Deceased appears to have had a life expectancy of 21 years; to have been .a prosperous farmer, ginner, and trader, and to have contributed about $1000 annually to the support of his family. The amount of the verdict was $10,000. Appellees charged the train operatives with negligence; to which appellant replied with a general denial and a plea of contributory negligence. By the eighth assignment of error, appellant complains of the eleventh paragraph of the court’s charge, which is as follows: “ If you believe from the evidence that Newton R. Roberts voluntarily placed himself on defendant company’s railway track, and you further find that those in charge of defendant’s engine saw the said Roberts on the track before it reached him, but failed to ring the bell or blow the whistle as soon as they saw him, in order to warn said Roberts of the approach of said train, then the defendant would be guilty of negligence; and if you further find that by reason of such negligence on the part of the defendant’s employes, said Roberts was struck by such engine or train and killed, then the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover.” We are of opinion that this charge contains error. It seems to be well settled in this State, that negligence is a question of fact for the jury, and that the court is not warranted in instructing them that the failure of the train operatives to ring the bell or blow the whistle as soon as they see a man on the track, in order to warn him of the approach of the train, would constitute negligence. Calhoun v. Railway, 84 Texas, 226; Railway v. Lee, 70 Texas, 501; Railway v. Anderson, 76 Texas, 249; Railwaw v. Dyer, 76 Texas, 160. In Calhoun’s case, above cited, it is said: “ The court has the right to instruct the jury that it is the duty of the operatives of the engine in approaching a public crossing to ring the bell or blow the whistle; but it is a charge upon the weight of the evidence if it instructs them that to perform or the failure to perform this duty shall be given a certain effect.” As this error in the charge will require a reversal of the judgment, in view of another trial, we invite the attention of the trial court to the authorities cited above with reference to other portions of the charge of which both appellant and appellees might, under these decisions, we think, justly complain, and of which, in the sixth assignment, appellant does in part complain; these cases having been reported since the trial below. The ninth assignment of error calls in question the twelfth paragraph of the charge, which reads as follows: “If you believe from the evidence that the said Newton R. Roberts voluntarily placed himself on the defendant’s railway track, and you further believe from the evidence that at said time and place he was struck and killed by one of defendant company’s engines or trains, but you further believe that those in charge of the defendant’s engine and train exercised proper care in looking to see whether or not its track was clear, and that those in charge of the train saw the said Roberts on or near the track in front of the train, or could have seen him by diligently looking out in front of the train, in time to ring the bell or blow the whistle in order to give him warning of the approach of the train, and that they did ring the bell and blow the whistle in time for Roberts to have heard it and get off the track, then those in charge of said train would have had the right to presume that he would get off the track; and if you so find, then the plaintiffs can not recover, unless you believe those in charge of defendant company’s engine and train rang the bell and blew the whistle, and saw that said Roberts was not going to get off the track before it reached him, or could have ascertained that he was not going to get off the track by the exercise of due care and caution, in time to stop the train before it reached him, and failed to do so.” While we do not think the objection as urged to this charge by appellant’s assignment would require a reversal of the judgment, still we are of opinion that it is objectionable as not containing a clear and correct statement of the law as applicable to the facts of this case; at least, we think the jury might easily have misunderstood what was doubtless intended to be expressed. The court evidently had in mind the doctrine of discovered negligence; and if, as some of the language might seem to imply, it was intended to state that though the perilous position of deceased resulted from his own negligence, appellant would still be liable for the failure of its train men to discover this peril by keeping a proper lookout, the charge was incorrect. Where a person goes upon a railway track, and is at the time of the collision, by his own negligence, placed in a dangerous position, he is not entitled to recover damages resulting from the injuries received on account of the failure of the train operatives to discover his position of peril in time to avoid the accident. In such case, his contributory negligence precludes a recovery, unless it also appears that after his position of danger is discovered, the operatives are guilty of negligence contributing to the injury. Where, however, at the time of the collision he is not guilty of negligence, though originally negligent in going upon the track, an intervening cause absolutely or perhaps morally beyond his control having but him in a position of peril, it seems that the railway would be guilty of actionable negligence, if through the want of proper care its train men should fail to discover the dangerous position of the person on the track in time to avert the injury. Railway v. Ryon, 70 Texas, 56; Railway v. Symkins, 54 Texas, 615; Wasmer v. Railway, 1 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, 132. It may be doubted, also, whether the court should have instructed the jury, that the train operatives upon ringing the bell and sounding the whistle could presume that the deceased would clear the track in time to escape injury. He seems to have been actively engaged for sometime prior to the appearance of the train, and up to the very moment of the collision, in an earnest effort to induce his mule—an animal whose restive disposition is common knowledge—to quit the track. As to whether railway operatives may presume that a person upon the track will leave it,, depends upon the facts of each particular case. The other assignments complaining of charges given and refused are not well taken, unless it be the sixth assignment, to which reference has already been incidentally made. The remaining assignments, relating to the verdict of the jury, need not be considered. It follows that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 10, 1893.","The Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. Louisa Roberts et al. No. 419. 1. Negligence—Charge of Court on Weight of Evidence.—Negligence is a question of fact for the jury. The court has the right to charge that it is the duty of those operating a train to ring the hell or blow the whistle as soon as they see a man on the track ahead; but it is error, as upon the weight of evidence, to charge that a failure on their part so to do would constitute negligence. 2. Contributory Negligence—Going upon Railway Track.—Where a person goes upon a railway track and is, at the time of the collision, by his own negligence, placed in a dangerous position, he is not entitled to recover damages resulting from the injuries received on account of the failure of the train operatives to discover his position of peril in time to. avoid the accident. In such ease his contributory negligence precludes a recovery, unless it also appears that after his position of danger is discovered, the operatives are guilty of negligence that contributes to the injury. 3. Same—Discovered Negligence .—Where at the time of the collision the person on the track is not guilty of negligence, though originally negligent in going thereon, an intervening cause absolutely or morally beyond his control having put him in a position of peril, the railway company will be guilty of negligence if, through want of proper care, its train men fail to discover the dangerous position of such person in time to avert the injury. 4. Charge of Court—Presumption of Fact.—Whether railway operatives, after blowing the whistle or ringing the bell, may presume that a person upon the track will leave it in time, depends upon the facts of each particular case, and the court should not charge absolutely that they may so presume. Appeal from Cass. Tried below before Hon. John L. Sheppard. F. H. Prendergast, for appellant. The court erred in the eleventh and twelfth paragraphs of its charge. [These clauses are set out in the opinion.] Railway v. Nixon, 52 Texas, 28; Railway v. Smith, 52 Texas, 185; Railway v. Ryon, 70 Texas, 59; Railway v. Garcia, 75 Texas, 587; Railway v.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This is a garnishment proceeding, instituted on October 6, 1890, in the County Court of Wise County, by the appellants, Charles Scheuber & Co., as plaintiffs in garnishment, against the appellee, W. T. Simmons, defendant in garnishment. The trial, had before a jury, resulted on January 16, 1891, in a verdict and judgment discharging the garnishee. The appellants were among the creditors of one Harry May, a liquor-dealer at Decatur, Texas. At the date of the trial their claim had been reduced to a judgment in the sum of $351.34. On Monday, September 22, 1890, Harry May, for the purpose of securing certain creditors other than appellants, executed a deed in trust to W. T. Simmons, conveying his saloon and the goods and fixtures connected therewith. At the same time he furnished to W. T. Simmons $250 in money to enable the latter, in connection with funds to be secured from one Mr. Vance, to take out a retail liquor dealer’s license. This sum of $250 was in no way included in the trust deed, but.it was delivered to Simmons for the sole purpose of procuring the license referred to. This fund constitutes the subject of controversy herein. The garnishee answered, denying indebtedness to May at the date of the service of the writ, or that he knew of any person who had in his possession effects belonging to him. He alleged, that at said date he held in his hands the sum of $250; that this sum was, on or about October 1, 1890, delivered to him by Harry May, and that before service of the writ, “ May agreed and directed that this respondent pay to the First National Bank of Decatur out of said money the sum of $50, the remainder to be apportioned among the creditors mentioned in said trust deed, and according to the distribution of the trust fund therein provided, which this respondent has done.” This answer was controverted by appellants, and issues by them were accordingly tendered. The sole evidence offered by appellee in support of these allegations was the testimony of a witness, Mr. Greathouse, manager of the First National Bank, as follows: “When I came into town Monday morning, and found that May had made the mortgage and had overdrawn for $46.60, I saw him and asked him why he had done so, and told him I wanted him to settle the overdraft at once. He told me that he had paid W. T. Simmons $250 toward procuring license; that he had no other use for the money than to get the license, and that he was willing that Simmons should pay me out of the $250 the sum of $46.60 for the overdraft, and that the remainder of the $250 should be apportioned among the creditors named in the mortgage in which Simmons was trustee.” In evident response to this testimony, the effect of which was quite emphatically contradicted by May and other witnesses for appellants, the court gave to the jury a charge which appellants appropriately assign as error, and which is as follows: “If you find that prior to the service of said writ of garnishment on defendant, that Harry May delivered to him $250 in money, and that he held said money when said writ was served, you will nevertheless find for defendant, unless you believe that the plaintiff has, by a preponderance of the evidence, shown that said May did not, at sometime prior to the service of said writ, agree with H. Greathouse, as the representative of the First National Bank, that said money might be paid to said bank and other creditors of May; and the burden is on plaintiff to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that no such agreement was made by said May.” If the agreement referred to in the above instruction was made by May and accepted by Greathouse as an assignment to the latter of so much of the funds in Simmons’ hands as should be sufficient to pay the debt to Greathouse (admittedly the sum of $47.60), we do not think, that to operate as such an assignment, it was necessary that the garnishee, Simmons, should himself have been present thereat or privy thereto. If, however, the agreement was in the nature purely of a negotiation not intended as a final contract by the parties, it could not operate as such an assignment. What the intent was should have been left to the determination of the jury under the evidence. The effect of this agreement, however, whatever the intention may have been, could not extend to the creditors referred to in the charge, because they were in no sense parties to the agreement. It does not appear that they were present, nor is there any intimation in the record, as we read it, that Mr. Greathouse represented them. Unless they knew and assented to the assignment, if indeed it was such, May, the supposed assignor, could not be held, so far as they were concerned who were entire strangers to the arrangement, to have placed the funds beyond his control. Drake on Attach., sec. 525. The instruction is therefore manifestly erroneous. The charge is further criticised, because it places the burden of proof on the plaintiffs with reference to the issues tendered. In this connection we deem it sufficient, in view of another trial, to call attention to the following language of our Supreme Court in Railway v. Terry, 50 Texas, 134: “In a proceeding of this character [a garnishment proceeding], the creditor is the actor, and the burden of proof is undoubtedly upon him; and unless he establishes the truth of his averments impeaching the answer of the garnishee, the latter must unquestionably be discharged. The garnishee is primarily required to stand merely upon the defensive. Hence it is not incumbent upon him to establish the truth of his answer,, but simply to repel the efforts of the creditor to impeach it.” For the 'error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause is-remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 30, 1893.","Charles Scheuber & Co. v. W. T. Simmons. No. 749. 1. Garnishment — Prior Agreement that Garnishee may Pay Other Creditors.—M., having funds in the hands of S., agreed with G., a creditor, that S. might pay G.’s debt out of the funds, and apply the balance ratably to the debts due certain other creditors. S. was not a party to the agreement, and as it seems had not made the actual payment and application of the funds as therein designated prior to service on him of a writ of garnishment by plaintiffs, who were also creditors of M. Held: 1. In order for the agreement to operate as an assignment to G. of So much of the funds as would pay his debt, it was not necessary for S. to be present thereat or privy thereto. 2. But if the agreement was in the nature purely of a negotiation not intended as a final contract by the parties, it could not operate as such assignment; and this question of intent should have been submitted to the jury. 3. As G. did not represent the other creditors referred to in the agreement, they were not parties to it, and its effect could not extend to them so as to place the remaining funds beyond his control. 2.

There was no valid contract entered into between Harry May and Simmons for the disposition of the §250 in question prior to the service of plaintiff’s writ, nor was there any contract entered into between Harry May and any one else prior to the service of the writ herein that could bind this fund in the hands of W.

"MARR, Judge. The counsel for the appellant state the nature and result of the suit as follows: “This suit is an action of trespass to try title, brought by appellant against appellees, by petition in the usual form, filed in the District Court of Jefferson County, May 5, 1891; the land sued for is part of lot 193, in block 39, in the city of Beaumont, in Jefferson County. The cause was tried without a jury by the District Court of Jefferson County, at its May term, 1891, and judgment rendered for appellees, William Higgins and Mary Higgins. Appellant Bordages appeals. ‘ ‘Appellant claims said premises under a judgment of the District Court of Jefferson County, rendered at its November term, 1890, in cause 1180, The City of Beaumont v. William Higgins and Mary Higgins. This judgment fixed a lien on the premises in controversy, in favor of the city, for local assessments for a sidewalk constructed in front of the said premises by the city, and ordered the premises in controversy sold as under execution. The appellant was the purchaser at such sale, and this suit is for possession of the premises. “The District Court held the judgment of the same court previously rendered open to collateral attack; that its judgment foreclosing a lien on the property for local assessments for the construction of sidewalks was void, because such local assessments were not taxes, and no other lien existed on which said judgment could be based.” The language used by the court below in its conclusions of law does not expressly justify the statement of counsel that the court held its former judgment “ subject to collateral attack and void,” but its decision as rendered in this case leads indubitably to the conclusion as drawn by counsel. The court found “that the judgment under which the sale of the property in controversy was made could not be attacked in this proceeding;” but as the court had found, as “ a conclusion of fact,” that the local assessments imposed by the city of Beaumont upon the property were not taxes within the meaning of the constitutional provision allowing a homestead to be sold for the taxes due thereon, the court, therefore, held in effect that the sale of the property was invalid, and gave judgment for the defendants. How the court reached this last conclusion without overturning or ignoring the former judgment of the District Court which authorized the sale of the property as it was subsequently made, we do not comprehend. The property in dispute is the homestead of the appellees, and has been for many years, and the local assessments or improvements were made thereupon by the city in the year 1890, at a cost of $20. The city of Beaumont is incorporated under the general laws, and in pursuance of the authority granted to such cities by articles 375 and 376 of the Revised Statutes, in the year 1889 passed an ordinance, through its common council, regulating the construction of pavements and sidewalks in the city, and the mode and manner of making the same, as well as of fixing the liability of the owners of the abutting property. The ordinance in effect, like the statute, provided that <6 the cost of the construction of any sidewalk erected by the city shall be defrayed by the owner of the lot, or part of lot or block, fronting on the sidewalk;” and further, that the assessment should create a lien on the property to secure such assessments and the costs of collection, for which it might be sold; and that the lien could be foreclosed by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction in default of payment, etc. The ordinance moreover required due notice to the owner, and gave him the right to erect the improvements as designated by the city; but if he failed to do so, then the city should construct them at his expense. In this case it appears that the appellees were duly notified to construct the sidewalk in front of their lot; but failing to do so, the city then erected the same. Upon the failure of the appellees to pay the costs of the sidewalk as erected by the city, the latter filed its suit in the District Court of the county by a petition, which seems to contain all of the essential averments to give the court jurisdiction and to authorize the foreclosure of the lien claimed by the city upon the property in that case. All of the facts and proceedings were duly alleged, and each of the appellees was duly cited by personal service, as provided by law in any ordinary civil suit, to appear and defend the action. They made default, and the District Court gave judgment against them and in favor of the city, foreclosing the lien upon the part of the lot owned by the defendants, and directed it to be sold as under execution to satisfy the amount of $20 (which the court found to be due the city), and the costs of the proceeding. A venditioni exponas issued upon the judgment, and the property in controversy was duly sold and conveyed to the appellant by the sheriff under the writ and judgment, for the sum of $27.50, which was the total amount of the assessment and the costs of court. The appellant, among others, presents the following assignments of error: 1. “The court erred in holding that the judgment of the District Court, the order of sale, the sheriff’s return thereon, in cause No. 1180, The City of Beaumont v. William and Mary Higgins, and the sheriff’s deed made to plaintiff in pursuance thereof, under all of which plaintiff claimed the premises in controversy, did not vest the fee simple title of said premises in the plaintiff.” 2. “The court erred in holding that sidewalk assessments were unconstitutional and could not be enforced against the homestead.” We are constrained to hold that both of these assignments are well taken. It is no longer an open question in this State, that local assessments for pavements or sidewalks, or other improvements of a similar character, when imposed and levied by a city, according to law, upon the abutting property, are special taxes for which the homestead may be sold as other lands in the mode which may be provided by law. The homestead may be subjected to forced sale under the Constitution for taxes due thereon, and it has been several times decided by the Supreme Court that those local assessments, if regularly laid, will create a lien upon even the homestead, of which the District Court, under the Constitution, has ample jurisdiction, and may foreclose the same. We bow to these decisions, and hold that the homestead of the appellees was not protected b)r the Constitution from these taxes, or assessments. Lufkin v. Galveston, 58 Texas, 549; Wood v. Galveston, 76 Texas, 126; Adams v. Fisher, 63 Texas, 654; same case, 75 Texas, 657; Allen v. Galveston, 51 Texas, 302; Roundtree v. Galveston, 42 Texas, 613. Were it otherwise, however, the judgment of the District Court foreclosing the lien in the original suit between the city and the appellees would preclude any inquiry into the validity of the assessment and lien, upon this collateral proceeding, as will be understood as we proceed. The appellees insist that that judgment is void, because the ordinance of the city of Beaumont, which we have already outlined, was likewise void. The ordinance, among other things, provided that the sidewalks should be constructed of “ brick, stone, or wood, or such other material as may be designated by the committee on bridges and streets, the committee to be composed of three aldermen, and to be appointed by the mayor.” This, it is claimed, was a delegation by the common council of a part of its legislative power and control over the subject to others, and in violation of law. Perhaps this position is entirely correct, and it seems to be supported by authority. Thompson v. Schermerhorn, 6 N. Y. App., 92. Still, if the question were before us in such way that we would be required to decide it, we might hold, that after rejecting this provision of the ordinance, enough would remain to accomplish the purpose of the act, and to justify its execution. The sidewalk which was erected upon the land in dispute was constructed of wood, one of the materials specified in the ordinance. But however this may be, we must hold that the judgment of the District Court in the original suit, as already suggested, is conclusive of this question, and of all others of like character which might have been invoked against that judgment in some direct attack upon it, or as reasons why it should not have been pronounced in the first instance, had the appellees appeared and contested the original proceedings. We are aware of no well considered case in which it has been held by any court of last resort that a judgment of a court of record and of general jurisdiction, rendered in a controversy where the court had regularly acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter and the person of the defendant, is absolutely void or subject to collateral attack for even errors of law apparent upon the face of the record. The erroneous decisions of the court upon questions of law are just as final and binding as would be its erroneous determinations of questions of fact arising upon the evidence. Such judgments are, at most, only voidable in some appellate or revisory proceeding. In this case we have discovered no fatal irregularity even in the proceedings in the original suit, as already intimated, were we called upon to review the same. Freeman correctly states the law upon the question in hand in the following language: “Jurisdiction being obtained over the person and over the subject matter, no error in its exercise can make the judgment void. The authority to decide being shown, it can not be divested by being improperly or incorrectly employed. Error of decision may be corrected, but not so as to reach those who have relied in good faith upon its correctness.” (This sentence relates to direct attacks.) “ The same rules apply to actions to recover delinquent taxes as in other cases, in respect to collateral attacks. It can not be shown, to avoid the effects of such judgments, that the taxes were previously paid. Neither will such judgment be any the less effective because it appears from the judgment roll that the assessment was illegal and void.” Freem. on Judg., sec. 135, and authorities cited, and note 5; 1 Black on Judg., secs. 170, 247, 261; Murchison v. White, 54 Texas, 78; Boggess v. Howard, 40 Texas, 153. A judgment by default is no exception to the general rule. Freem., secs. 330, 532. There are authorities to the effect that where a special tribunal is created or a special jurisdiction is conferred upon a court of record to enforce the collection of taxes, a judgment by default in such proceeding is not conclusive upon the owner of the land. Laws cited in 1 Black on Judg., sec. 247, and Cool, on Tax., 358, 359. But these decisions have no application to the question in hand, for the reason that the District Court in this State does not exercise a special or limited jurisdiction when it forecloses a lien upon land, but its authority to try “all suits for the enforcement of liens upon land” is derived directly from the Constitution as a part of its general jurisdiction. Const., art. 5, sec. 8. Doubtless the popular belief, justified by experience, that scarcely any tax sale would confer a valid title to land, conduced to the small price at which the land of the appellees was struck off by the sheriff; but the sale, as we have seen, was judicial, and could scarcely be termed a “ tax sale.” This brings us to the consideration of the objections made by the appellees to the sale of their homestead upon the alleged grounds of gross inadequacy of price and excessive levy by the sheriff. The part of the lot owned by the appellees (and which was ordered to be and was sold) is 80 feet wide and 60 feet long, and was worth over- $1000 when sold under the judgment. Their improvements occupied only 16 feet front, and on each side thereof there was a strip of the land 32 feet in width, which was shown to have been worth several hundred dollars. It is claimed that the sheriff should have levied upon one of those “strips,” which would have been greatly more than sufficient to have satisfied the judgment and costs, instead of selling the entire property. We are compelled to hold, however, that this claim is without any legal foundation. Both the judgment and the writ of venditioni exponas commanded the sheriff to seize and sell the entire portion of the lot owned by appellees, and left him no discretion in the matter. There is no doubt that the price for which the land was sold is grossly inadequate; but that alone, without fault upon the part of the purchaser, will not vitiate the sale; nor would an excessive levy, if shown, coupled with such inadequacy of price, be sufficient to avoid the sale, unless it should further appear, as does not in this case, that such levy conduced to the insufficiency of the price. Vide Jones v. Pratt, 77 Texas, 210; Pearson v. Flanagan, 52 Texas, 266; Cook v. De la Garza, 13 Texas, 431; Atcheson v. Hutchison, 51 Texas, 223; Scott v. Solomon, 59 Texas, 593; Haskins v. Wallet, 63 Texas, 213. We have not in the examination of this case confined ourselves to the points made by the appellees, but have diligently searched the record to discover some legal ground upon which we could affirm the judgment of the District Court, but in vain. We reversé it with great reluctance, on account of the apparent hardship that will thus be inflicted upon the appellees. They are shown to be two “ old and infirm negroes” (husband and wife), who have occupied this land for a number of years as their only home and place of abode; and now it seems, from the record, that their homestead is to be taken from them for a paltry sum, and on account of petty street improvements. They may have been foolish — perhaps obstinate or ill advised; but these things, if true, which does not appear, do not lessen the asperity of the case. It is to be hoped that the almost cruel consequences of these proceedings will serve to some extent as a salutary warning, and that the next time the people utter their will upon the homestead exemption the cities of the State can then no longer levy “locals assessments” upon the homes of the people, but shall be required to provide for the improvement of “ streets, alleys, and sidewalks ” by ad valorem taxation, at least so far as homesteads are to be affected. A sense of duty and the inexorable mandates of the law compel us to recommend that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded. Adopted March 22, 1892. UPON MOTION TO REFORM JUDGMENT. HENRY, Associate Justice. Upon report of the Commissioners of Appeals the judgment in this cause was reversed at the last Galveston Term of this court, and the cause itself was remanded for a new trial. Before the adjournment of that term a motion was filed by the appellant to reform the judgment, and instead of reversing and remanding to reverse and render judgment for the appellant. We have re-examined the record with the view of determining whether our disposition of the cause was correct, and we have concluded that it was not. The cost of constructing the sidewalk adjacent to the lot owned by the appellees was $20. Without questioning, for the purposes of this appeal, the correctness of anything that was said by Judge Harr in the opinion adopted by us,, in regard to the regularity of the proceedings of the city in the construction of the improvement, so as to make the cost of it justly a debt against the lot and its owners, and in holding that its being a homestead did not prevent the lien from attaching to the lot, we are of the opinion that some other considerations of importance have been overlooked. Article 475 of the Revised Statutes provides how the estimate of the cost of such improvements shall be made, and declares that the amount imposed shall be ‘ ‘ levied and assessed as taxes and shall be a lien upon the property until the payment of the same.” In the case of Allen v. Galveston, 51 Texas, 318. this court said: ‘ ‘ These grants of power to make local assessments are strictly construed and must be strictly followed.” Cooley says, in his work on Taxation, that where a right to bring suit to collect a tax is expressly given, ‘ ‘the statute must be closely followed, and any conditions which are named must be observed.” Page 435. Article 474 of the Revised Statutes, by virtue of which the tax now in question was imposed, directs that it shall be collected “in equal annual payments, not less than five in number.” This would have required the appellees in this case to pay four dollars each year for five years. Article 476 provides for a notice to be given of the time when the tax will become due; and if it is not paid, it provides as follows for the enforcement of the lien on the land: “Said officer or committee shall levy on so much of any property on said list, on which said tax has not been paid, as will be sufficient to pay the same, and the same notice of sale as is required in sales for other tax shall be given; and if said tax be not paid before the day of sale, said officer or committee shall sell said property in the name, and under the circumstances, and to the extent, and subject to the same conditions which are or may be provided by ordinance for the sale of real estate in the city charged with the payment of taxes imposed by said corporation; and said officer or committee shall execute a deed to the purchaser at any such sale, and all the provisions of this title in reference to a deed drawn by the assessor and collector shall apply to the deed provided for in this article.” One of the important rights here secured to the owners of the property by reference to other tax sales is, 1 ‘ that when real estate is offered for sale, the smallest portion of ground (to be taken from the east side of the premises) shall be sold, for which any person will take the same and pay the taxes, and costs, and fees.” Rev. Stats., art. 446. The authority to bring a suit or the collection of the tax is conferred by article 477, Revised Statutes, reading as follows: “ In addition to the power and authority granted to the city council to collect said assessment of taxes as aforesaid, they shall have the further power and additional remedy of instituting suit in the corporate name, in any court having jurisdiction of the recovery, against any owner of property, for the amount due for any such work so made as aforesaid; and the city council shall provide, by resolution or ordinance, under the provisions of this title, for carrying out and executing the powers in this chapter conferred; and may adopt such resolutions, and enact such ordinances, and make such regulations as they may deem necessary. ” It is not necessary for us to say that the last clause quoted was not intended to confer upon the council power to pass ordinances in conflict with, or to enlarge or limit, the provisions of the statute. It confers the power upon the city council to enact ordinances in harmony with the statutes, and,'in strict subordination to them, to provide ways and means for applying and enforcing them. The article (477) authorizing a personal suit and judgment is explicit and unambiguous. It only authorizes such a suit ‘ ‘ for the recovery against the owner of property for the amount due.” It is a personal suit that is provided for, and a moneyed judgment only is mentioned. It does not authorize a suit against the property. It does not authorize a personal judgment against the owner of the property, together with a foreclosure of the lien upon the property. A lien upon the property is given by the statute, but the manner of its enforcement is carefully and fully provided for. The right to also bring a suit is not left to inference; neither as to whether one may be brought at all, nor as to what it shall include, if brought. It may be brought “ against the owner for the amount due,” “in any court having jurisdiction.” We think it must be presumed, that when the Legislature expressly provided for the two modes of procedure, each one complete within itself— one providing exclusively for a remedy against the property, and the other exclusively for a personal remedy — the intent of the law was fully expressed, and that it should be interpreted and enforced as written. The record shows on its face that the suit was brought by the city against the property to enforce the lien, and not against the owners of the property to recover a personal judgment, and that the judgment was rendered in the same way. The District Court has a general jurisdiction to render a judgment to enforce a lien on land, without regard to the amount of the debt or the value of the land. The tax of $20 was in this case a lien on the land, because the law made it so; and if the Legislature had given a suit for the enforcement of the lien, as well as the recovery of the debt, the jurisdiction of the District Court would have existed by the terms of the Constitution. But not when the Legislature has provided another remedy for the enforcement of the lien and has failed or refused to give a suit for that purpose. If the record in the case in which the judgment was rendered foreclosing the lien had failed to disclose that the cause of action was one over which the court had nó jurisdiction — if it had been silent in that respect — we would be required in this case (where it is brought collaterally in issue) to presume that it was rendered upon a state of facts giving jurisdiction, and it would then, as is said in Judge Harr’s opinion, preclude all further inquiry. In the case of Withers v. Patterson, 27 Texas, 496, Justice Bell clearly expresses the rule and its limitations as follows: “If the court orders a sale of land when the circumstances do not exist which under the law authorize it do so, it acts in doing so without jurisdiction, or, in other words, without authority. These are plain propositions. The difficulties which are presented to courts arise in cases where there is a deficiency of proof as to the circumstances under which the court acted in ordering the sale. “The question in such cases is, how far is proof (which is wanting) to be supplied by presumption ? In the absence of proof there undoubtedly always arises a presumption that a court of general jurisdiction has acted, in doing a thing which it has power under certain circumstances to do, within the limits of its authority. The presumption is that the court has done what it was right to do, and not that it has done a wrong. The circumstances which would have authorized the court to act as it did act are presumed to have existed. But presumptions are indulged in the absence of proof, and not against proof.” As the record in the suit brought by the city of Jefferson to enforce the tax lien discloses on its face the want of jurisdiction in the court, the judgment rendered was void, and it must be treated as a nullity whenever it is brought in question, whether it be in a direct or a collateral proceeding. The distinctions between the proceeding to enforce the lien against the property and the suit for the debt are so apparent, and their different effects upon the rights of the property owner generally, and especially in the instance now under consideration, are so important as not to admit of the conclusion that the Legislature intended that they should be intermingled, instead of each being pursued as an independent or distinct remedy. The sum adjudged against the property was $20. The costs of court and for making the sale amounted to $14.05. The judgment was rendered on the 24th day of November, 1890. The sheriff sold the entire lot on the 7th day of April, 1891. After the judgment, and before the sale, the property owners paid to the attorney of the city on the tax the sum of $6. The property brought at the sheriff’s sale $35. The lot measured 60 by 80 feet. The evidence of the market value of the lot ranged from $800 to $1600. It had on it the residence of the owners, on each side of which there were strips of land each about 30 feet wide, each one of which, the owner testified, was worth $600, and that he had been offered that price for one of them. The result of the suit, if allowed to have effect, would be to compel the owner to pay the entire tax, with costs, in less than one year, and to have his whole property sacrificed in a body at a sale to collect a tax; whereas, if the property had been proceeded against under protection of the statute, it could only have been for $4, if nothing had been paid; and even if sold for the whole debt, it seems reasonable to conclude that less than the whole lot might have been found sufficient. When the result of disregarding a compliance with the specific terms of the remedies given by the statute may lead to such important differences, we do not think that the courts can treat the distinctions made by the Legislature as immaterial, nor permit the two remedies to be intermingled. It appears that the city council had passed an ordinance on the subject, of this tax, which, among other things, provided as follows: “ The cost of the construction of said sidewalk shall be a lien in favor of the city for the amount thereof on the property of such owner, and said lien shall exist in favor of the city for such costs, and shall be by the city enforced in any court having jurisdiction of the subject matter of a suit brought for the purpose, and said property sold according to law to pay the cost of such construction, besides the costs of suit.” The language of this ordinance clearly embraces the jurisdiction that was attempted to be exercised by the District Court, and if the city council had been invested with the power to annul or amend an act of the Legislature, it would support the judgment in this case. But, as we have said, the city council had no authority to enact an ordinance inconsistent with the statute. The motion will be granted, insomuch as it seeks to set aside the judgment heretofore rendered by this court, and the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed. Delivered June 24, 1892.","J. K. Bordages v. William and Mary Higgins. No. 229. 1. Sidewalk Assessments — Liability of Homestead. — The city of Beaumont, under the authority of articles 375 and 376, Bevised Statutes, passed an ordinance providing that the cost of constructing any sidewalk in the city should be defrayed by the owner of the abutting lot, and gave him the right to make it; but if he failed to do so, the city should construct it and assess the cost thereof against such abutting owner, and such assessment should become a lien for the amount thereof against the property of such owner, and might be enforced in any court having jurisdiction, by suit and foreclosure. Such a suit (in all respects regular) having been brought and judgment of foreclosure had, and sale of appellees’ homestead made thereunder for the sum of $27.50, held: It is no longer an open question in this State that local assessments for pavements or sidewalks, when imposed by a city according to law upon the abutting property, are special taxes, for which the homestead may be subject to forced sale. 2. Conclusiveness of Judgment —Collateral Attack. —The judgment of the District Court foreclosing the lien in the original suit between the city and the property holder, though by default, precludes any inquiry into the validity of the assessment lien in a collateral proceeding. 3. Same. — The ordinance provided that the sidewalk might be constructed of brick, stone, wood, or such other material as might be designated by the street committee, who were composed of three aldermen to be appointed by the mayor. This is claimed to be a delegation by the common council of a part of its legislative power, and there are authorities to support this position, but the judgment of the District Court is conclusive of this question, and of all others of like character which might have been invoked against the original judgment. 4. Res Adjudicata. — We are aware of no well considered opinion where the court has acquired jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit and of the person of the defendant, in which it has been held that the judgment rendered was subject to collateral attack for errors of law apparent upon the face of the record. Such erroneous decision is just as final and binding as would be its erroneous decision on a question of fact. 5. Jurisdiction. — The rule which provides, that error in the exercise of jurisdiction, after it has been properly obtained over the person of the litigant and the subject matter of the suit, can not make the judgment rendered void, applies to actions to recover delinquent taxes, as in other cases, in respect to collateral attacks. It can not be shown, to avoid the effect of such judgments, that the taxes were previously paid or the assessment illegal and void. 6. Jurisdiction of the District Court, — Where a special tribunal is created or a special jurisdiction conferred upon a court to enforce the collection of taxes, a judgment by default for taxes is not conclusive on the landowner; but the District Court does not exercise a special or limited jurisdiction in enforcing a lien upon land for taxes, but its power to do so is derived directly from the Constitution. 7. Foreclosure Sale — Inadequacy of Price. — The lot was worth $1000 and sold for $27.50. There is no doubt that the price paid was grossly inadequate, but that alone will not vitiate the sale, even with an excessive levy (had there been one) added. 8. Levy not Excessive. — The lot was 80 feet wide, the improvements occupied only 1G feet front, and on each side thereof there was a strip of land 32 feet wide. Although a levy on one of these strips would have been sufficient to satisfy the money judgment rendered, both the judgment and the venditioni exponas directed the sale of the entire lot, and the sheriff had no discretion in the matter of the levy. 9. Homestead Law — Suggested Amendment. — The power given cities to levy on a homestead for local improvements should be withdrawn, and improvement of streets provided for by ad valorem taxation. ON 3IOTION BY APPELLANT TO REFOR3I AND RENDER. 10. Sidewalk Improvements. — Article 475, Revised Statutes, provides how the estimate of the cost of such improvements shall be made, and declares that the amount imposed shall be levied and assessed as taxes, and shall be a lien upon the property until the payment of the same. These grants of power must, be strictly construed, and the statute closely followed. 11. Collection of Tax, How Enforced. — Article 474 of the Revised Statutes requires that the tax shall be collected in not less than five annual payments. Article 476, Revised Statutes, provides that the levy shall be on so much property as will be sufficient to pay the same, and like notice of sale as in sales for other taxes shall be given, and sale shall be subject to the same conditions provided by ordinance for other tax sales. One of the important rights here secured to the owner is a sale of the smallest portion of ground that any person will take, and pay the taxes, 12. Authority to Sue. — Article 477 authorizes suit as an additional remedy, and requires the city council to provide by ordinance for carrying out and executing the powers conferred, but does not give the council power to pass an ordinance in conflict with or enlarging or limiting the provisions of the statute, but only in harmony with and strict subordination to them. 13. Same — Construction of Statutes. — Article 477, Revised Statutes, only authorizes a personal suit and moneyed judgment against the owner for the amount due. It does not authorize a suit against the property, nor one against the owner and the property together. A lien is given by statute, but the manner of its enforcement is provided. Suit may only be brought against the owner for the “ amount due.” 14. Same. — The Legislature having provided two modes of procedure, each complete within itself, one exclusively against the property and the other exclusively against the person, the law should be interpreted and enforced as written. 15. Jurisdiction of the District Court. — The suit which is the basis of the sale of appellees’ homestead was a suit to enforce the lien, and not for a personal judgment. The tax of $20 was a lien by statute; but the Legislature not having given a suit for its enforcement, but having provided another remedy, the District Court was without jurisdiction. 16. Want of Jurisdiction Apparent of Record. —When the record fails to disclose a want of jurisdiction, jurisdiction is presumed as against a collateral attack, but such presumption is not indulged against proof; and the record (in the judgment foreclosing the tax lien) upon its face disclosing the want of jurisdiction, the judgment was void and must be pronounced a nullity whenever brought in question, whether in a direct or collateral proceeding. 17. Legislative Intent. — Distinctions between proceedings to enforce the lien and suit for the debt are so apparent, and their different effect upon property owners so important, that it can not be presumed that the Legislature intended the remedies to be intermingled. 18. Invalid Tax Ordinance. — The ordinance of the city of Beaumont giving power to any court of competent jurisdiction to entertain a suit to foreclose the tax lien, was enacted without authority and is inconsistent with the statute. ON MOTION FOR REHEARING. 19. Construction of Statutes — Article 376,Revised Statutes,defines the powers of the city council with reference to sidewalks, and makes the assessment a lien upon the abutting property, and authorizes collection by a sale of the lot in such manner as the city council by ordinance may provide. The passage of the ordinance by the city of Beaumont, under which the suit to foreclose the tax lien was instituted, was authorized by this section. Articles 474, 475, 476, 477, Revised Statutes, relate to avenues, streets, and alleys exclusively, and examination of articles 375 and 376 in connection with those relating to avenues, streets, and alleys, will show that they are treated as separate and distinct. Article 376 is a special and independent provision relating to sidewalks, and is not in any manner controlled by articles 474, 475, 476, and 477, nor is the manner of sale controlled by article 446. 20. Homestead Subject to Sale. — The fact that the lot was the homestead of Higgins and wife would not defeat the lien of the assessment, nor prevent its being sold in satisfaction thereof. 21. Practice. — In view of the gross inadequacy of price, and because the case went off on another ground, the first judgment of the Supreme Court is adhered to, and the case reversed and remanded. Appeal from Jefferson. Tried below before Hon. W. H. Ford. The opinions state the case. Douglas & Lanier and O’Brien & O’Brien, for appellant. The District Court being a court of general jurisdiction, and the judgment in cause 1180, The City of Beaumont v. William and Mary Higgins, having been rendered according to the course of the common law, after due service of citation on each of the defendants therein, its judgment is not open to a collateral attack as attempted in this case, but the same is conclusive between the parties thereto and their privies in estate. Seguin v. Maverick, 24 Texas, 526; Nichols v. Dibrell, 61 Texas, 539; Johnson v. Templeton, 60 Texas, 238; Wilkerson v.

Galveston, 51 Texas, 320; Cool. on Tax., 446, and note; Elliot on Roads and Streets, ch. 23, p. 369. Where a sheriff’s sale under an order of court is regular, mere gross inadequacy of price, even in a direct proceeding brought for that purpose, is no ground for setting aside such sale; and the facts of this case show.and the judge trying same finds that the sale in question was in all things regular. Jones v. Pratt, 77 Texas, 210. R. H. Leonard, for appellees. The lot was sold at a grossly inadequate price, which under the circumstances should render the sale void. Cornelius v. Burford, 28 Texas, 202-208; Riddle v. Bush, 27 Texas, 675-678. The sale of said lot 193,.under and by virtue of the city ordinance No. 42 of the city of Beaumont, should be held null and void, because said ordinance is without authority of law, unconstitutional, null and void; because said ordinance shows that the city council delegated its authority to enforce said ordinance to a committee and the enforcement of the ordinance was at the option of the committee.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. The original petition was filed by the appellee, H. Gross, against the appellants, F. Strauss & Co., on the 30th day of August, 1889. The amended petition was filed November 11, 1889. The action is upon a written and verbal contract. The written contract is as follows: “ Office of F. Strauss & Co., Wholesale Liquor Dealers, “ No. 62 West Second Street, “ Cincinnati, February 26, 1889. “ This agreement, made by and between F. Strauss & Co,, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Heyman Gross, of Lampasas, Texas, witnesseth: That said F. Strauss & Co. have engaged said Heyman Gross as their travelling salesman at a salary of $200 per month from March 1, 1889, in consideration of which salary the said Heyman Gross agrees to sell such goods as the said F. Strauss & Co. handle, and to effect sales for them which shall aggregate from $35,000 to $40,000 per annum. No orders by the said Heyman Gross shall be considered as sales unless the same are approved by said F. Strauss & Co. F. Strauss & Co. furthermore agree to pay the travelling expenses of the said Heyman Gross, which shall not exceed $8.50 per day, and shall be less if possible. “ Witness: “Ferd H. Strauss. F. Strauss & Co., H. Gross.” The foregoing agreement is set out in the petition; and it is further alleged, that in addition thereto it was verbally agreed between the parties at the time and after the date of the same, and prior to March 1, 1889, that plaintiff would be paid by defendants to the extent of $150 per month, and that defendants would retain $50 per month of the salary of $200 per month until the expiration of one year from the 1st of March,, 1889, as a guaranty that plaintiff’s sales should aggregate the amount set forth in the written contract; and that he would not be required to keep an itemized account of his travelling expenses under the contract, but that he should report the same to defendant from time to time, and the-same, not to exceed $8.50 per day, would be paid by defendants as it should be reported and incurred. That pursuant to the written agreement, plaintiff, on the 1st day of March, 1889, entered upon his duties as travelling salesman for defendants, and continued faithfully to perform his duties under the contract, when on the last date, he was discharged by defendants and notified that his salary would be discontinued. That during the time he served them he had made sales for them amounting to more than $10,000, which were approved by them, during which time his travelling expenses amounted to $682.40, which were from time to time reported by him to them. That from the time of his discharge, June 1, 1889, to October 1, 1889, he diligently sought other employment, but failed to secure it, but on October 1, 1889, defendants still refusing to carry out their agreement, he found and accepted employment at $150 per month, with expenses paid by his employer. That during the time he was out of employment, from June 1 to October 1, 1889, his reasonable expenses were $125. That he has always, up to the 1st of October, 1889, been ready and willing to carry out his contract with defendants, and frequently offered to do so. That he could easily have effected sales for defendants during the year from the 1st of March, 1889, for an amount over $35,000, which would have been approved by them if they'had retained him; that the original contract did not specify Whether sales by plaintiff should be for cash or on a credit, but before the 1st of March, 1889, it was agreed that he should sell for cash or on a credit, as he might see proper. The petition specifies the amounts which defendants are liable to pay him,. $600 salary for March, April, and May, 1889; $682.40 for his expenses, during that time; $800 as damages for his illegal discharge, the amount of salary due for the time he was out of employment, from June 1, 1889, to October 1, 1889; and §50 per month during the time he earned by other employment §150 per month from October 1, 1889, to March 1, 1890, §250; aggregating §2332.40. He admitted payment of §1000, leaving a balance due him of §1332.40, for which he asked judgment. Defendants filed exceptions to the petition, to the effect, that it did not state a cause of action; that it seeks to recover unearned wages, and sets up a paroi agreement changing a written agreement; but the exceptions were not, it seems, called to the attention of the court; at least, there was no ruling upon them. Defendants filed a general denial; admitted the written contract to pay plaintiff §200 per month and §8.50 per day as expenses while travelling on defendants’ business; that prior to June 1, plaintiff’s services were dispensed with, and that on that date they were due him as salary §600, due for March, April, and May, 1889; but alleged that of this sum §300 had been paid his wife at his request; that on account of the expenses for travelling due him, being §665.40, they had paid him §700, and denied that he had incurred §120 as expense since June 1, 1889, or any other sum. Defendants alleged, that under the contract they had the right to discharge him at any time, which he knew, and fully consented thereto, and that the hiring of plaintiff was by the month. Defendants also set up, that while plaintiff was in their service he sent them an order for one W. L. Marshall, amounting to §447.08, which they refused to fill, whereupon plaintiff agreed in writing to guarantee the payment of the order if they would furnish the goods; that they did upon such guaranty fill the order, which Marshall had refused to pay, and plaintiff became indebted and bound to pay defendants the amount, for which they asked judgment. They also asked for further judgment against plaintiff for §1000 on account of his neglect of their business, and the further sum of §34.68, amount overdrawn by plaintiff for travelling expenses, making a total claimed by them against plaintiff of §148.68. The case was tried by the court, and judgment was rendered for plaintiff for §868.32, with interest from March 1, 1889, at 8 per cent. Defendants have appealed. The written contract was proved as alleged, and it was shown by plaintiff’s testimony that the verbal contracts set up by him were made by the parties on the same day, in the afternoon, after the written contract was executed. This was denied by the evidence of defendants. ■ It was agreed, that plaintiff worked under the contract three months, from March 1, 1889, to June 1, 1889, when the defendants repudiated the contract and discharged him; that during the three months plaintiff’s travelling expenses were §665; that on account of salary and expenses defendants have paid plaintiff §1000; and that plaintiff is liable to defendants for the Marshall debt of §447.08. The court filed findings of facts, supported by the testimony, that the written contract was made as alleged, and that afterwards, on the same day, the verbal contract was made that defendants should retain $50 per month of plaintiff's salary as a guaranty that his sales would amount to $35,000 at the expiration of one year (the foregoing facts agreed to); that plaintiff was wrongfully discharged after he had worked three months; that plaintiff used due diligence to secure other employment, but failed to do so until October 1, 1889, when he obtained employment as alleged at $150 per month; that the contract was an employment for one year at $200 per month. It was also proved, that plaintiff could have made sales for defendants of their goods to the amount of $35,000 or $45,000 during the year if he had not been discharged. Appellants have assigned errors as follows: “1. The court erred in overruling defendants’ second special exception to plaintiff’s first amended original petition. “ 2. The court erred in overruling defendants’ third special exception to plaintiff’s first amended original petition. “ 3. The court erred in overruling defendants’ fourth special exception to plaintiff’s petition. “ 4. The court erred in permitting plaintiff to introduce testimony to vary the written contract, the said testimony not being of an explanatory nature. “5. The court erred in its findings of the facts herein. “6. The court erred in construing the instrument sued on to be a hiring by the year. “ 7. The court erred in its declaration of the law herein. “ 8. The court erred in finding judgment for the plaintiff.” These assignments, except the fourth and sixth, fail to point out any specific error, and under the rules should not be considered. The fourth assignment is not as explicit as it should be; it fails to designate the particular act of the court complained of. We presume it refers to the testimony of plaintiff, that it was agreed by him and defendants, after the written agreement, that defendants should retain $50 per month of his salary until the end of the year, as a guaranty that he would sell as much as $35,000 or $40,000 worth of goods during the year. It was admissible. It was a concession by plaintiff to secure the performance of the contract—an agreement collateral to the main agreement, made after it and not inconsistent therewith—and was not obnoxious to the rule, that prior and contemporaneous paroi agreements should not be admitted to vary or change the terms of a written contract. Besides, it was admissible as furnishing some explanation of the indefinite terms of the writing as to the period of employment. Thomas v. Hammond, 47 Texas, 43; 1 Greenl. Ev., secs. 282, 284a (note 2), 304 (note 4); Railway v. Jones, 82 Texas, 157. Was it error to construe the contract as an employment for one year ? Taking the entire contract together, the employment of plaintiff as travelling salesman at a salary of $200 per month from March 1, 1889, in consideration or conditioned that he make sales aggregating $35,000 or $45,000 per annum, it would seem that it was the intention of the parties that he was to continue in the service for one year. The year’s service was to determine his right to the stipulated salary. This view is strengthened by the subsequent agreement that defendants were to reserve $50 per month of the $200 until the end of the year as a guaranty that plaintiff would sell $35,000 or $40,000 worth of goods during the year. It can not be held that the lower court’s construction of the contract was erroneous. On the contrary, we think it was correct. The evidence shows that plaintiff sustained the damage ascertained by the court on account of the breach of the contract without cause by defendants, after allowing the credit of $1000 and of the Marshall account. Ho reversible error is assigned, and our opinion is that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed. Delivered February 15, 1893.","F. Strauss & Co. v. H. Gross. No. 134. 1. Defective Assignments of Error.—Assignments of error which do not point out some specific error under the rules, should not be considered on appeal. See example. 2. Parol Collateral Agreements. — A paroi agreement collateral to the main agreement in writing, made after it and not inconsistent therewith, is admissible in connection with the written contract. It is not obnoxious to the rule that prior and contemporaneous paroi agreements are inadmissible to vary the terms of a written contract. See example. 3. Construction of Contract of Hiring.—The employment of plaintiff as a travelling salesman at a salary of $200 per month from March 1,1889, in consideration or conditioned that he make sales aggregating $35,000 to $40,000 per annum, would indicate an intention of the parties that the term of service should be for one year. This construction is strengthened by testimony to a subsequent paroi agreement that the hirer might retain $50 per month until the end of the year as a guaranty for the sale of the stipulated amount of goods during the year. From such testimony the finding of the court that the hiring was for one year is sustained. Appeal from Lampasas. Tried below before Hon. W. A. Blackburn. W. T. League and A. G. Walker, for appellants. Parol statements made subsequent to the execution of a written contract can not be made so as to vary the legal construction of the written instrument. Plaintiff alleged in his petition, “that in addition to the stipulations in said contract, it was verbally agreed and understood by and between plaintiff and defendant, at the time of and after said contract was entered into, and prior to March 1, 1889, that plaintiff would be paid $150 per month, and that defendant would retain $50 per month out of said plaintiff’s salary of $200 per month until the expiration of one year from March 1, 1889, as a guaranty that said plaintiff’s sales would aggregate the amounts set forth in the contract.” Litchenstein v. Brooks, 75 Texas, 196; 2 Pars, on Hon., 60; 1 Add. on Con., 364. Mathews & Wood, for appellee. Appellee having been discharged without cause before the expiration of his time of employment, he was entitled to recover all damages sustained by reason of his discharge. These damages were the amount of one year’s salary and the plaintiff’s travel-ling expenses while in defendant’s employ, less all wages that plaintiff had received and could possibly receive from other employment until the expiration of the year, and less all payments made to plaintiff by defendant. And the facts being proved from which the amount of damages could be ascertained, the court did not err in rendering judgment for the amount of damages as so ascertained."
"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This appeal is prosecuted by J. P. Smith, and the City Bank of Sherman from a judgment rendered April 30, 1890, by the District Court of Wichita County, in an action of trespass to try title, wherein J. J. Lang, appellee, as' plaintiff, recovered from appellants, as defendants, seven tracts, or 4936 acres of land. This land was at one time admittedly the property of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, and from it, as a common source, the appellants and the appellee deraign title. Conclusions of Fact.—August 28, 1885, J. J. Lang recovered a judgment for the sum of $26,621 against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company and others, in the District Court of-Wise-County. December 8, 1886, under a valid alias execution and levy, the land was sold at sheriff’s sale, and Lang became the purchaser thereof. Such is his title. April 24, 1885, the Boatman Savings Bank recovered a judgment for the sum of 820,740 against J. W. Dabbs, R. M. Henderson, A. A. Henderson, S. G. Tomlinson, Walker Fore, W. J. Morphy, as-principals, and against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, J. W. Wilson, J. W. Sacra, John H. Stone, F. J. Hall, and R. S. Rollins, as endorsers. June 1, 1886, by virtue of this judgment and alias process issued thereon, the land referred to was sold at sheriff’s sale, J. P. Smith, the appellant, becoming the purchaser. He conveyed to his codefendant, the City Bank of Sherman, an undivided one-fourth interest, by deed dated February 25, 1888. This constitutes the title of appellants. In July,. 1884, R. M. Henderson, one of the principal debtors in the judgment of the Boatman Savings Bank v. J. W. Dabbs et al., delivered to R. S. Rollins, one of the endorsers upon the note upon which that judgment was rendered, two notes against J. P. Smith, J. B. Reed, and E. G. Thurmond. The purpose of this transfer and delivery was to secure Rollins, the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, and the other endorsers upon the note to the Boatman Savings Bank. On November 11, 1885, judgment was had against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond for the sum of 88250 on one of these collateral security notes; and on the same day the Boatman Savings Bank recovered a judgment against the same defendants upon the other one of the notes for the sum of $8250. A stay of execution on both these judgments was had until June 1, 1886. March 2, 1886, the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company transferred to F. M. Daugherty, subject to the interest of the Boatman Savings Bank, the two judgments last mentioned. On May 20, 1886, the Boatman Savings Bank, by its attorneys, transferred, in consideration of the sum of $8537.35, to J. P. Smith the judgment of the Boatman Savings Bank v. J. W. Dabbs et al. The consideration paid by Smith, $8537.35, was the exact amount then remaining due upon the judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank v. J. W. Dabbs et al. The amount due upon the two judgments against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond, held, as above indicated, by the Boatman Savings Bank as collateral security, was $16,500, with interest at 10 per cent from their date. On May 20, 1886, the date of the transfer by the Boatman Savings Bank through its attorneys to Smith, the latter held against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company four promissory notes, as follows: 1. A note for $9200, dated August 1, 1884, with 10 per cent interest from date, payable one year after date to the order of S. A. McAdams, endorsed by him in blank, and credited September 1, 1885, with $2540. 2. A note for $6583, dated July 1, 1884, with 10 per cent interest per annum from date, payable one year after date to the order of J. M. Rols, and by him endorsed in blank, and credited September 1, 1885, with $7140. 3. A note for $3982.75, dated July 1, 1884, with 12 per cent interest from date, payable one day after date, to the order of J. M. Rols, and by him endorsed in blank, and credited January 12, 1885, with $500. 4. A note for $8781.66|, dated July 15, 1884, with 10 per cent interest from date, payable one year after date to the order of R. McCubbin, and by him endorsed in blank, and credited September 1, 1885, with $5140. Conclusions of Lato.—Under the foregoing facts, we concur with the trial court, that the Boatman Savings Bank was subrogated, as regards the judgments against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond, to the rights of the original owners of those judgments, Henderson, Dabbs, and others, principals in the main judgment, and of Rollins, the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, and others who were sureties therein. Coleb. on Coll. Secur., secs. 217, 212. These collateral judgments against Smith and others were held by the Boatman Savings Bank as a pledge to secure the payment of the original judgment against Dabbs and others. As a pledge, they were an incident to the debt evidenced by the main judgment, and were so transferable with the latter. Coleb. on Coll. Secur., sec. 79, p. 107; Freem. on Judg., sec. 431; The Batesville Inst. v. Kaufman, 18 Wall., 151. We fail to appreciate the distinction, in this respect, sought to be drawn by appellants’ counsel between a pledge and a mortgage. The thing pledged ,• in its character as a security, is as much an incident of the debt intended thereby to be secured as would be a mortgage. The transfer of the main judgment to Smith operated as a transfer of the collateral, and going thus hand in hand, so to speak, the latter, to the extent of the former, must be held to have operated as a cancellation of the former. Otherwise it will have altogether lost its character as a pledge for the former. It is not to be questioned, that had Smith paid to the Boatman Savings Bank the amount of the collateral judgments against himself, such payment would to the extent thereof have discharged the main judgment. Unless the converse be true, the purpose with which the Boatman Savings Bank held the collateral judgments would be defeated, and Dabbs, with the remaining principals, and the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company and the remaining sureties on the main judgment, would be deprived of all benefit from the collateral held for them by the Boatman Savings Bank. It would seem that payment, under such circumstances, of the one judgment would operate pro tanto to extinguish the others, and vice versa. Freem. on Judg., sec. 467. When Smith took a transfer from the Boatman Savings Bank of the judgment against Dabbs, Henderson, and others as principals, and the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company as endorsers, it can not be so accurately said that he purchased the judgment as that he paid it. And this is true, because he owed the amount which he paid; not indeed for the reason that he was directly a party to the judgment which was transferred to him, but for the reason that he was a debtor in two judgments held by the transferrer as a security and a pledge for the judgment transferred, and that as between himself and the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company he was primarily liable. His obligations, reduced to judgments, were held by the Boatman Savings Bank as a security for the obligation of Dabbs and of the cattle company which he purports to have purchased. When he, with J. D. Reed and E. G-. Thurmond, executed the notes on which were founded the judgments against him, he contracted that these notes might be assigned by their holders as a pledge or security for any debt which might be due by them. He must be held then to have contracted for their payment in contemplation of the fact that they might or would be assigned to the Boatman Savings Bank (as to any other person, natural or artificial), to whom their payees might become indebted. He is not, under the facts stated, to be regarded as occupying the attitude of a stranger, taking as such an assignment of the judgment. He did not purchase it; he paid it. Otherwise the very purpose for which his primary obligations had been legitimately pledged would be defeated. It can not be said that this interpretation of the transaction produces a result which will operate as a hardship upon Smith. The money paid by him upon the principal judgment will have been applied to the payment of his own obligations, and in a manner which might be considered as within his contemplation at the time he bound himself by the promissory notes afterwards pledged to secure the debt of their holders. The latter will have secured the benefit of the collateral securities, legitimately obtained and pledged by them to the payment of their obligation; and the Boatman Savings Bank, the pledgee, will have collected the amount justly due it. Thus, ‘ ‘ all things ’ ’ between the several parties 11 will have been made even,” and the behests of equity fully subserved. The fact, insisted upon by appellant, that at the time of the transfer by the Boatman Savings Bank to Smith the latter held other notes of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, does not affect the conclusion above expressed. These notes can not, as we think, be used to thus defeat the specific purpose with which the judgments against Smith were pledged, not only in the interest of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, but also of its cosureties and others, principals in the main judgment. The further fact which appellants sought to prove, that in 1888, F. M. Daugherty, assignee (subject to the rights of the Boatman Savings Bank) of the collateral judgments, brought suit against Smith to revive these judgments, is alike, in our opinion, immaterial. That suit and the issues therein involved must be regarded as “ res inter alios acta.” Nor do we find merit in the contention of appellants against the admissibility of the testimony of the witness Rollins, wherein he refers to the notes against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond, giving the names of those who signed them, and stating their date and amounts and the particular notes on which the judgments against Smith, Reed, and Thurmond were rendered. The character of these notes as pledges was the issuable fact in this connection. This fact rested in paroi. It could not be otherwise proved, because it did not otherwise exist. The notes themselves were merged in judgments and the judgments were read in evidence. We do not think that it was improper that the witness should be permitted, in explanation of this issuable fact, to state, without producing the notes themselves, the date and amount thereof and the names of the signers, and to trace them to the judgments, which were themselves introduced. This testimony seems to us to have been but collateral to the main issue. 1 Greenl., sec. 89. The further fact, that at the date of the transfer to Smith the collateral judgments were not mature, is also, in our opinion, immaterial, since they were mature on June 1, 1886, the date of his purchase at the sheriff’s sale. As in our opinion the judgment on which this sale rested had been by Smith, in the manner above indicated; paid off and satisfied, there was then and is now no basis for appellants’ title. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 30, 1893.","J. P. Smith et al. v. J. J. Lang. No. 73. 1. Judgment as Collateral Security — Payment — Principal and Collateral Security Debts Mutually Extinguished, When. —B. obtained a judgment against D. and others, and afterwards held, by transfer and as collateral security for its payment, two judgments against one S., which were the property of some of the defendants in the principal judgment against D., and which in their aggregate exceeded the amount then remaining due on such principal judgment. S. paid to B. such remaining amount, and took a transfer of the principal judgment to himself. Held: 1. Such transfer operated as a transfer of the two judgments held as collateral security, which were thereby, as against S.. the judgment debtor therein, extinguished to the extent of the amount he had so paid for the principal judgment; and conversely, the transaction operated as an extinguishment of the principal judgment, so that a subsequent execution sale of lands of the defendant made thereunder by S. was void. 2. The fact that at the time S. took the transfer of the principal judgment he held notes against one of the judgment debtors therein—the one whose lands he afterwards had sold thereunder—could not be used to defeat the specific purpose for which the two collateral judgments were pledged, viz., the protection of all the judgment debtors in the principal judgment. 2. Parol Evidence of Written Instrument—Where the character of certain notes as pledges was the issuable fact, and this matter rested in paroi, it was not error to allow a witness to state, without producing the notes themselves, the date and amount thereof, and the names of the signers, and to trace them to the judgments into which they had been merged, and which judgments were themselves in evidence.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. This suit was brought by the appellant in the District Court of Anderson County on April 14, 1890, against W. J. Hamlett and wife, J. B. Watkins, and Milton Rush. The object of the suit was to recover judgment against defendants Hamlett and wife fur debt due by them on a promissory note, and judgment also for same debt against defendant Rush upon alleged assumption of same by Rush, and an assignment thereof to plaintiff by defendant W. J. Hamlett; and for the foreclosure of a mortgage upon two tracts of land, one containing 40 acres and the other 160 acres of land, executed by defendants Hamletts to cure the debt sued for, and which land had been purchased by defendant Watkins at a sale made under a junior mortgage executed for his benefit by said Hamlett and wife; and for the further purpose of enforcing the vendor’s lien upon said lands; and upon another tract of 200 acres, formerly occupied by Hamlett and wife, and which, together with the 160 acres and the 40 acres, mortgaged as aforesaid, were conveyed by Hamlett and wife to defendant Rush, for a valuable consideration, on January 5, 1887. The defendants Hamlett and his wife answered by general denial and plea of coverture for the wife. The defendant Watkins answered the plaintiff’s petition by admitting the prior lien of the plaintiff, and avei> ring that the defendant Hamlett having made default in the payment oí his debt to defendant, he had caused the trustee in his mortgage, under power óf sale given therein, to sell the said 160 and 40 acres of land, and at said sale defendant became the purchaser; and further averring that by the terms of the sale made to defendant Rush by Hamlett and wife, Rush assumed the payment of Hamlett’s debt to plaintiff, and his debt to defendant also; and that the deed of conveyance from Hamlett to Rush reserved the vendor’s lien on all of the tracts of land sold to Rush, and that said lien had been transferred to plaintiff. He prayed that the court would require the plaintiff to first sell the tract of 200 acres, upon which there was no mortgage, before seliing the other two tracts purchased by defendant at the sale made as aforesaid under his mortgage; and he further prayed that if both the mortgaged land and the other tract sold to Rush should be sold under the decree of the court, and if the amount realized from the sales should be insufficient to satisfy both the plaintiff’s debt and his own, that he might have judgment against Rush for any balance due him; and for general relief. Defendant Rush, on the 21st of November, 1890, filed, under affidavit, his amended original answer to plaintiff’s petition, in which he denies that he ever assumed to pay either Hamlett’s debt to plaintiff or Hamlett’s debt to defendant Watkins. He admits that he traded his homestead in Ellis County to Hamlett for 400 acres of land in Anderson County, and that at the time of the trade he knew that the two tracts of 40 and 160 acres each were subject to the mortgages of plaintiff and defendant Watkins, and that he traded for the land subject to the liens; but he denies that he agreed to become liable for either of said debts, and avers that he traded with the distinct understanding and agreement with the said Hamlett that he would not become responsible for either his debt to plaintiff or his debt to Watkins, and that the tract of 200 acres, which was the homestead of Hamlett and wife, must be free from all liens or other incumbrances, otherwise he would not exchange lands with him. That his own homestead was paid for and free from all liens, and that he must have one in the same condition. That upon the assurance of Hamlett that such was the case, the trade was agreed to, and Hamlett was to convey the homestead free of liens, and the other tracts of 160 and 40 acres each; he to redeem these lands or not, as he, defendant, might elect. And in addition Hamlett was to execute to him his eight negotiable notes for $350 each; and defendant and wife were to convey to Hamlett their homestead in Ellis County; that his wife and himself, on their part, did execute to Hamlett a deed to their homestead, and that Hamlett executed his eight notes to defendant, each for $350, and delivered to defendant a deed for the three tracts of land. That defendant, relying on the assurances of Hamlett, supposed and believed that the deed of conveyance was executed in accordance with the terms of the trade, and did not know that said deed reserved a lien upon the lands, and by its terms made him liable for the debts of Hamlett, until the deed was examined by his counsel, after the institution of plaintiff’s suit. Charges that the recitals reserving a lien and making defendant liable for debts due plaintiff and defendant Watkins were inserted through procurement of Hamlett, without the consent or the knowledge of defendant, and that Hamlett well knew that he, defendant, would never have conveyed his homestead had he known that a lien would be retained upon the lands' sold him, or that he was to be made liable for Hamlett’s debts; avers his ignorance of the law, and that he is unable to read manuscript, and that he relied upon Hamlett to have the deed properly drawn; charges him (Hamlett) with fraud, and prays that the deed from him to Hamlett may be reformed and made to conform to the terms of the trade; and for general relief. On the 23d day of April, 1891, plaintiff filed, with leave of the court, his first supplemental petition, excepting to defendant Rush’s first amended original answer, and on same day defendant Rush filed his original answer to demands of defendant Watkins, in which he adopts his first amended original answer to plaintiff’s petition. Upon this state of the pleadings the case was on the same day, April 23, 1891, called for trial, when all parties announced ready, and a jury was impanneled; and when the pleadings had all been read the plaintiff moved to submit his exceptions to Rush’s answer to the court, and the court declined to consider the same, because the day for considering and determining questions of law, in cases in which juries were demanded, had passed; and plaintiff’s cause had been called on that day for the purpose of hearing exceptions, and none were presented for the consideration of the court; to which ruling the plaintiff excepted, and the trial proceeded; and after argument had begun, plaintiff discovering that some of his evidence was not before the court, as he supposed it to be when he announced ready, took a voluntary nonsuit, and thereupon the trial proceeded upon the answer of defendant Rush, charging fraud, and praying that his deed from Hamlett be reformed. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and judgment was rendered, reforming the deed in accordance with the prayer of the complainant Rush, and dismissing the plaintiff’s suit as to the other defendants, without prejudice to plaintiff; and motion for new trial having been overruled, plaintiff gave notice of appeal. The first error assigned is the refusal of the court to consider and determine the exceptions filed by leave of the court, on the day of the trial of the cause, to defendant Rush’s first amended original answer. In support of the first proposition under this assignment appellant cites Rev. Stats., arts. 1192 and 1269, and Teas v. McDonald, 13 Texas, 349. With all deference to counsel, we do not think these authorities applicable to the question before us. Article 1289, Revised Statutes, makes it the duty of the court to dispose of all questions of law in causes in which trial by jury is demanded, as far as practicable, before the day set for the trial of such cases. The trial judge in this case, in an addendum to plaintiff’s bill of exceptions, states that Monday, the 20th of April, 1891, was the day set for hearing and deciding questions of law in the jury cases, and that on that day the docket was regularly called and all parties given an opportunity to present their exceptions, and that none were presented in this case by the plaintiff. The answer of defendant, to which exceptions were filed on the 23d of April, had been on file since the 20th of November, 1890. The plaintiff offered to the trial court no excuse for or explanation why his exceptions were not presented prior to the day set for the trial of jury cases. Under such circumstances we can not hold that the court erred in refusing to entertain the exceptions when presented. Article 1289 is obligatory upon the judges of the District Court. Its purpose is obvious, and unless a judge is clearly guilty of abuse of power in his efforts to enforce the observance of this statute by litigants, this court will not interfere. The second error assigned is, that the court did not reinstate the cause upon plaintiff’s motion to set aside nonsuit. The basis of plaintiff’s suit against defendants Hamlett and Watkins was a note or bond of Hamlett, with attached coupons, and the grounds for his motion to reinstate are thus stated in the motion: “ Plaintiff resides in New York, and was not present at the trial of this cause. The bond and coupons, as well as the $99 notes sued on, were in the possession of the L. M. Watkins Land Company, and when suit was instituted it was believed by plaintiff’s attorneys, and so understood, that some of the coupons, to-wit, those due February, 1888, 1889, and 1890, and those due August, 1888, 1889, and 1890, not being paid, that the bond for $1000 became due, which is a fact, and so alleged, and gave plaintiff his right of action against defendants. “ When plaintiff’s counsel announced ready for trial, they were of opinion that said coupons were attached to said bond; but after argument had commenced, it was found that the coupons past due at the time of filing of the petition were not in their possession, but were believed to be in the possession of Watkins, one of the defendants, and laboring under such mistake, plaintiff announced ready for trial.” From this it will be seen that had counsel inspected the bond before announcing ready for trial, tjiey would have discovered the loss of the coupons; and the sole question presented for our determination is, did the trial judge abuse his discretion in refusing the motion to set aside the nonsuit ? While we admit that the court might properly have sustained the motion, as to defendants Hamlett and Watkins, we are not prepared to say that his refusal to do so would warrant us in reversing the ruling, when no injury is shown to result to plaintiff. The third and fourth assignments we will not consider seriatum, as the objections urged under them to the action of the court in refusing plaintiff’s motion to grant him a new trial may be considered under three heads: (1) That the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict; and (2) that the weight of the evidence is against the verdict; and (3) that the evidence discovered since the trial, as shown by the affidavit of McKinney, should have secured a new trial. As to the first objection, we think the evidence was amply sufficient to sustain the verdict, if the jury gave credence to the testimony of the witnesses for the defendant. It was the province of the jury to determine the credibility of the witnesses, and if they gave credit to the defendant’s witnesses, rather than to plaintiff’s, the verdict should not be disturbed in the absence of any evidence tending to show that it was the result of prejudice or other improper influence. The second proposition is, that the weight of the evidence was clearly with the plaintiff, and therefore the verdict, under the law, as given in the charge, should have been set aside. We consider the case to be one of a conflict of testimony, rather than a question of preponderance of evidence; and when this is the case, and the trial judge who hears the witnesses testify refuses to set aside the verdict, it is well settled that the appellate court will not do so. We deduce from the record these conclusions of fact, viz.: That the defendant Rush and W. J. Hamlett agreed to an exchange of lands; that Rush conveyed his homestead to Hamlett in consideration of the conveyance to him by Hamlett and wife of their homestead containing 200 acres, and the two tracts of 160 and 40 acres each, and the execution of eight negotiable promissory notes for $350 each by Hamlett to Rush, and that the 160 and 40 acres tracts were received by Rush with the full knowledge of the mortgages of plaintiff and defendant Watkins, and that Rush paid some $140 on these mortgage debts after he took possession of the lands; and that after a few months he concluded the lands were worth less than the debts for which they were liable, and he then determined not to redeem them, and so notified both Hamlett and his creditors. Delivered October 14, 1892. We further conclude, that Bush made large and valuable improvements upon the 200 acres, the former homestead of Hamlett, and that Bush was not present when the deed of conveyance from Hamlett to Bush was prepared by McKinney, under instruction from Hamlett, and that there is no evidence that the deed was read to Bush, or that he read it for himself, before delivering his deeds to Hamlett. When these facts are considered in connection with the testimony of all the witnesses, we are not prepared to say that the preponderance of the evidence is against the verdict. The appellant’s first proposition under the fourth assignment is not questioned, but the law as contained in this proposition is not applicable to the facts. The “newly discovered evidence” is the affidavit of McKinney, the notary who prepared the deeds from Hamlett and wife to Bush, and from Bush and wife to Hamlett, and took their acknowledgments. The testimony of this witness is: “I have no recollection of reading the deed to Mr. Bush, as the law does not require a notary to read a deed to a man before he acknowledges it. Yet I am satisfied that Mr. Bush did fully understand that the vendor’s lien was retained in the deed on all the 400 acres of land, to secure the payment of the two notes named in the deed; he may have forgotten.” This affidavit is clearly not such as the law requires to support an application for a new trial, on ground of newly discovered evidence. Besides, the answer of Bush setting up fraud was filed on the 20th day of November, 1890, and the deeds of conveyance showed that McKinney took the acknowledgments, and no reason is shown why the deposition of this witness, if material, was not taken before the trial. We discover no error for which the judgment should be reversed, and we therefore affirm it. Affirmed. Justice Williams did not sit in this case.","Joseph E. Briggs v. Milton Rush et al. No. 5. 1.

When April 20, 1891, was the day for hearing and deciding questions of law, by the custom and usage of the court, in jury cases, and on that day the docket was called and all parties given opportunity to present their exceptions, and none were presented to the answer of the defendant, which had been on file since November 21,1890, but on the day of trial, April 23,1891, exceptions were filed by the plaintiff, and after announcement of ready for trial action by the court upon them was sought, the refusal of the court to entertain them was not an abuse of its judicial discretion. 2. Nonsuit — Reinstatement.—After argument begun the plaintiff discovered that some of his evidence was not before the court, and took a nonsuit, and the case proceeded to judgment as between the defendants. The ground for the motion to reinstate being that plaintiff resided in New York, and was not present at the trial, and that his attorney when he announced ready for trial supposed certain overdue coupons were attached to the bond sued on, or were in the hands of one of the defendants, and did not discover his mistake until after announcement; held (no injury being shown to result to the plaintiff), that refusal of the motion was not an abuse of judicial discretion. 3. Verdict. — If the jury gave credit to defendant's witnesses rather than to the plaintiff's, the verdict should not be disturbed, in the absence of any evidence tending to show that it was the result of prejudice or other improper influence. 4. Correction of Deed — Case in Judgment. — R. and H. agreed to an exchange of lands. R. conveyed to H. his homestead, in consideration of the conveyance to him by H. and wife of their 200 acres homestead, and two other tracts of land of 40 and 160 acres, and the execution of eight notes for $350 each. There were two mortgages upon the two tracts of 40 and 160 acres when R. traded for them, of which he had notice and upon which he afterward paid $140, but subsequently concluded that said lands were worth less than the debts for which they were mortgaged and determined not to redeem them, and so notified H. and his creditors. The deed from H. to R. reserved a vendor’s lien upon all the land sold, and by its terms bound R. to pay the mortgage debts. These recitals were alleged by R. to have been inserted fraudulently, through the procurement of H., and without the knowledge or consent of R , who averred ignorance of law and inability to read manuscript, and reliance upon H. to have the deed properly drawn. There was no evidence that the deed was read to R., or that he read it himself before delivery of his deeds to H. R. subsequently made valuable improvements on the 200 acres homestead tract of land he had purchased. Under these facts, a verdict and judgment reforming the deed and releasing the homestead from the lien of the debts was affirmed. 5. New Trial for Newly Discovered Evidence. — When the deed attacked for fraud was dated January 5, 1887, the answer alleging fraud filed November 20, 1890, and the trial April 23, 1891, the evidence of the notary who took the acknowledgment to the deed, detailing what took place at that time, was not newly discovered evidence authorizing grant of a new trial.

"KEY, Associate Justice. The appellants, who were bankers, doing business in Lampasas, Texas, brought this suit December 11, 1888, in the District Court of Lampasas County, against John Hanen and appellees, on a note for $1025, executed by them to appellants on March 25, 1888, payable ninety days after date. At the trial appellants dismissed as to defendant Hanen. At the time of the execution of the note sued on appellants held the personal notes of John Hanen, one for $400 and the other for $718.17, and attached to each of the notes was a mortgage on sheep and the wool thereon to secure the particular note to which the mortgage was attached and all other indebtedness of said Hanen 11 then existing or which might thereafter arise.” After the execution of the note sued on the plaintiffs took another note from Hanen for $936.12, to which was attached another mortgage, securing same and all other indebtedness of said Hanen “ then existing or which might thereafter arise,” this mortgage covering the same sheep as those covered by the mortgage attached to the note for $718.17. The appellees in their answer admitted the execution and delivery of the note sued on, and answered further as follows: That they signed said note as sureties for Hanen; that their suretyship was not only known to plaintiffs at the time the note was signed, but they signed as such sureties relying upon the representations of both Hanen and plaintiffs that all of Hanen’s indebtedness to plaintiffs, which at the time amounted to about $2243, was secured by mortgages on all of Hanen’s sheep, which then numbered about 1300 or 1400 head, of the value of about $2600 or $2800; that appellees never saw the mortgage, but relied upon the statements of plaintiffs that they held such mortgages; that plaintiffs failed to register either of said mortgages, permitted Hanen to remain in possession of the sheep, and permitted him to ship 320 head of them, of the value of $1000, out of the State of Texas, and permitted him to sell the wool of said sheep; that after the execution of the note sued on Hanen paid off the said note for $400 and said note for $718.17, and plaintiffs cancelled said notes and the mortgages thereto attached and surrendered them to Hanen, and about the time of the payment and surrender of the note for $718.17 took from him the note for $936.12 with the mortgage thereto attached; that the indebtedness secured by the mortgage last taken was in great part incurred after the execution of the note sued on; that plaintiffs foreclosed the last mortgage given without making appellees parties to the suit, taking judgment and decree of foreclosure only for amount then due on the note for $936.12, and at the foreclosure sale thereunder bid in 776 head of the sheep for $338, then being worth $1500, but the same were prevented from bringing their full value by reason of other liens being secured thereon after the execution of said mortgages, which other liens were secured by reason of plaintiffs’ failure to register their mortgages; and that by reason of such failure the appellees had lost their rights to the balance of said sheep, and other persons had acquired superior rights thereto. The appellees also alleged the insolvency of Hanen, and prayed that they be discharged from all liability on the note sued on. Appellees further prayed, that in the event it should be held that they were not entirely discharged from all liability, that plaintiffs be required to account for all of said mortgaged property, etc., and also for general relief. 'At the trial an agreement between the-parties was made and filed, by which it was agreed as follows: 1. That the note for $718.17 and mortgage attached set out in defendants’ answer was executed on February 25, 1888, and said note was can-celled April 10, 1888. 2. That the note for $400 and mortgage attached set out in defendants’ answer was executed on March 10, 1888, and said note was paid June 5, 1888. 3. That the note for $936.12 and mortgage attached set out in defendants answer was executed on April 10, 1888, and was made up with the amount of said $718.17 and interest and some cash advanced Hanen on that day, and the mortgage attached covered the same property described in the note for $718.17. 4. That no part of the judgment in favor of J. H. & L. W. Galbraith against John Hanen on said note for $936.12, a copy of which is attached to defendant’s answer, had been paid, beyond the sum of $164.13, paid on September 7, 1888. This agreement being made, the balance of the case was submitted tó the jury on special issues, in response to which the jury found as follows: 1. Stanley and Townsend signed the note sued on as sureties, and plaintiffs knew they signed as sureties. 2. They were induced to sign the note by the declarations of plaintiffs that they held a mortgage to secure all of Hanen’s indebtedness to them. 3. Plaintiffs informed them that they held a mortgage on 1300 or 1400 head of sheep and the wool thereon. 4. At the time defendants signed the note sued on, the sheep on which plaintiffs held the mortgage were worth $2 per head. 5. The §400 note was paid off by Hanen after the execution of the note sued on, and the note and mortgage were surrendered and delivered to Hanen. 6. The note for §718.17 and the mortgage given to secure the same were surrendered to Hanen after the execution of the note, sued on. 8. Plaintiffs have realized out of the mortgaged property the $400 note and the amount received from the sale of sheep at Goldthwaite, less amount of attachment and cost, or about §167. 9. Plaintiffs did not file any of said mortgages for record. If they had done so the property would have been sufficient to satisfy all the indebtedness of Hanen and defendants to plaintiffs at the time of the execution of the note by defendants. 10. In July, Hanen shipped about 320 head of the mortgaged sheep, worth about $1.75 per head, to a foreign market. Plaintiffs permitted by not preventing such shipment; they did not authorize such shipment by special authority, but did by not preventing same. 11. The sheep that were shipped were included in the mortgage to secure the note for $718.17. In answer to special issues submitted on request of plaintiffs, the jury found: 2. By failure to record the mortgages there were lost the sheep secured by Wood, value about $492, and the amount of the attachment at Goldthwaite. 3 and 4. The mortgages, attached to the notes for §718.17 and §400 were released by cancellation of the notes, each note and mortgage being the same instrument of writing. In answer to special issues submitted on request of defendants, the jury found: 2. The evidence does not show that plaintiffs have accounted for all the wool of all the sheep mortgaged. The court then, upon the said written agreement filed and the findings of the jury, rendered judgment for appellees, from which appellants have appealed. No motion to set aside the verdict or for new trial was made. We adopt the foregoing written agreement of the parties, and the findings of the jury in response to the special issues submitted to them, as our conclusions of facts, to be used as such, if appellants desire to carry the case to the Supreme Court. The -first assignment of error is, that the court erred in holding that the mortgages set up in appellees’ answer were security for the note sued on. The record does not show that the court so held. One of the defenses interposed by appellees was, that if in fact the note sued on was not secured by mortgages, that appellants had induced appellees to sign the same by representations that they held mortgages to secure all of Hanen’s indebtedness to them. The findings of the jury sustain this plea, and the court may have been of the opinion that these mortgages did not operate as security for the debt sued for, and judgment may have been rendered on the finding of the jury referred to. The alleged error in the second and third assignments in the ruling of the court in excluding parol evidence offered for the purpose of showing that the mortgages were not intended as security for the debts sued for, even if well taken, can not avail to reverse the ease; because if these mortgages do not secure this debt, then, as the jury found that appellees were induced to sign the note by appellants’ representations that they held mortgages to secure all of Hanen’s indebtedness, appellees are not liable. Such representations, if false and relied upon by appellees, were a fraud upon them. Brandt on Sure, and Guar., secs. 348, 352. The fifth assignment of error is as follows: “ The evidence failing to show that the defendants Townsend and Stanley sustained any loss by failure of plaintiffs to record their mortgages, said failure to record would be no defense to plaintiffs’ cause of action.” The sixth assignment of error is as follows: “ The surrender of the $400 note and mortgage attached upon payment of said $400 note did not operate as a cancellation or extinguishment of said mortgage, except to the extent of said $400 note, in the absence of proof of an express release of the entire mortgage.’ ’ It will be observed that these assignments do not assert that there were no findings of the jury that loss had resulted from the failure to record the mortgages, nor that the findings do not show a full cancellation of the mortgages. The jury found that by failure to record the mortgages there were lost the sheep secured by Wood, value about $492, and the amount of the attachment at Goldthwaite; and that the mortgages attached to the two notes were released by cancellation of the notes, each note and mortgage being the same instrument of writing; so these assignments must be treated as assailing these findings of the jury. This being the case, and appellants having failed to present a motion for a new trial in the court below, asking to have the verdict and judgment set aside because not supported by the testimony, they will not be heard to urge this objection on appeal. Foster v. Smith, 1 Texas, 70; Reynolds v. Williams, 1 Texas, 311; Hart v. Ware, 8 Texas, 115; Cain v. Mack, 33 Texas, 135; Sears v. Green, Posey’s U. C., 727; 2 Thomp. on Trials, sec. 2712. The eighth assignment of error asserts, that the appellants were not required to take any active steps against Hanen, the principal in the note sued upon, but had a right to remain inactive, and to depend for protection upon the sureties on said note. To this proposition we do not assent. While it is true that for the purpose of having an execution run against the property of the principal, generally, it does not require, for the protection of the surety, that the payee of a note shall institute suit at any particular time, unless requested in writing to do so by the surety; yet, when property is pledged to the creditor, by mortgage or otherwise, to secure a debt, and the latter has the right to control the property, he becomes trustee for the surety as well as the principal, and he rests under the same obligations that other trustees similarly situated do. The surety, by paying the debt, has the right of subrogation to all the security held by the creditor, and the law demands of the trustee — the creditor — the exercise of reasonable care and diligence for the preservation of the property, to the end that it may be devoted to the purpose for which the trust was created — the payment of the debt. The fourth assignment of error is as follows: “ The judgment of the court below is contrary to law, and not supported by the evidence or findings of the jury, for the following reasons: The defendants having admitted the plaintiffs’ cause of action, as alleged by plaintiffs, and having assumed to avoid said cause of action on the following grounds: “ 1. Because of the suretyship of defendants Townsend and Stanley, and an alleged change made by plaintiffs in the contract by which said sureties were bound. “2. Because of the loss of certain sheep and wool belonging to the principal, John Hanen, which defendants allege were bound for the payment of the note sued on; said loss, as defendants allege, being occasioned by the failure of plaintiffs to register their chattel mortgage. “3. Because of the loss of certain sheep belonging to the principal! John Hanen, which defendants allege were bound for the payment of the note sued on; said loss being occasioned, as defendants allege, by the shipment of 320 head of sheep out of the State by authority of the plaintiffs. “4. Because of the release by plaintiffs of certain mortgages given by John Hanen, alleged to be security for the payment of the note sued on; and the evidence and findings of the jury being wholly insufficient to sustain either of said defenses, judgment should have been rendered for plaintiffs.” Delivered November 9, 1892. Appellees except to this assignment as being too general, and we think the exception is well taken. Both the statute and the rules require that assignments of error shall specifically point out the alleged error; and the statute declares that errors not thus assigned, and not fundamental, shall be considered as waived. This assignment is nothing more than an assertion that the judgment is not supported by the evidence and findings. The fact that it recites the nature of the several defenses interposed by appellees, and that they had assumed the burden of proof, does not relieve the assignment from the objection made. For the reasons already stated in regard to the fifth and sixth assignments, we can not consider the action of the jury in passing upon the testimony submitted to them; and applying this assignment to the findings of the jury and the agreed facts, the record discloses fourteen separate findings of the jury, and four distinct facts are agreed to; and appellants by this assignment say that these findings and facts do not sustain either of the four defenses set up by appellees, without specifying wherein they fail so to do. Repeated decisions of the Supreme Court have held such assignments to be too general. Yoe & Harris v. Montgomery, 68 Texas, 338; Ackerman v. Huff, 71 Texas, 317; Sup. Ct. Rules 25, 26; Rev. Stats., art. 1037, and cases there cited. The seventh assignment of error, to the effect that the surrender of the $718.17 note and mortgage attached, and taking a new note for $936.12 with mortgage attached, on the same property, the new note including the debt for which the old one was given and some cash advanced, did not constitute a change in the contract entered into by appellees, or operate as a cancellation or extinguishment of the first mortgage, even if well taken, can not result in a reversal of the judgment; because, if it be conceded that there was no change made in appellees’ contract of surety-ship, still there were other defenses set up in their answer, and for want of a sufficient assignment of error we are precluded from considering whether or not they are sustained; and because that portion of this assignment which alleges that there was no cancellation or extinguishment of the first mortgage named therein, in effect, assails the finding of the jury that the mortgage was released, which, as heretofore shown, can not be done in this case, because there was no motion for a new trial made in the court below. No reversible error is assigned, and the judgment is affirmed. Affirmed.","J. H. & L. W. Galbraith v. J. R. Townsend and J. E. Stanley. No. 18. 1. Immaterial Issue. — Sureties made defense that they were induced to sign the note sued upon by the false representation by the principal and the payees that it was secured by a chattel mortgage upon a flock of sheep. The jury sustained the plea. Held, upon a judgment for the defendants’ sureties, such judgment could have been rendered upon such plea, and that it could not be assumed that the court necessarily had found upon another hypothesis, viz., that the sheep had been mortgaged, and the security lost by negligence of the plaintiffs. 2. Same — Parol Testimony. — It was immaterial that parol testimony may have been excluded to show upon what debts the sheep were security, the jury having found that the sureties were induced to sign upon the fraudulent and false representations that the note had been secured by the chattel mortgage. 3. Practice — Failure to Move for New Trial. — In absence of a motion for new trial, the Andings of fact by the jury will not be revised on appeal, for want of testimony to sustain them. 4. Care and Diligence by Creditor Holding Security. — When property is pledged to the creditor by mortgage or otherwise to secure a debt, and he has the right to control the property, he becomes a trustee for the surety as well as the principal, and he rests under the same obligations that other trustees do under like circumstances — reasonable care and diligence for the preservation of the property, to the end that the debt be paid. Grounds of loss were that the creditor had failed to register the mortgage, whereby the property became subject to other liens, and had permitted part of the property to be shipped off and sold. These would release the surety. 5. Assignments oí Error. — Both the statute ancl the rules require that assignments of error shall specifically point out the alleged error. The fact that an assignment recites the nature of the several defenses interposed, and avers that the defendants (appellees) had assumed the burden of proof, does not relieve an assignment from the conditions of the statute when the assignment in effect merely urges that the judgment is not sustained by the testimony. See example. Appeal from Lampasas. Tried below before Hon. W. A. Blackburn. W. B. Abney, for appellees. 1. It did not appear from the mortgages set out in defendants’ answer that the note sued on in this case was secured thereby. The mortgages set out in defendants’ answer on their face show that they were to secure the personal indebtedness of John Hanen only, and not the joint indebtedness of Hanen and other persons. Smith v. Montgomery, 3 Texas, 199; Brandt on Sure, and Guar., secs. 97, 98. 2. Parol evidence was admissible to identify the debts and show the consideration for the mortgages introduced in evidence, especially after defendants had offered some testimony as to the consideration. Taylor v. Merrill, 64 Texas, 494; Northington v. Tuohy, 2 Ct. App. C. C., 326; Hitz v. Bank, 111 U. S., 725; Herm. Chat. Mort., sec. 60; Jones on Mort., sec. 352. 3. If the debt sued on was secured by the mortgages in evidence, a failure to record such mortgages would only operate as a release of the liability of the defendants on the note sued on to the extent of the loss sustained by them by the failure to record. Brandt on Sure, and Guar., sec. 389; Herm. Chat. Mort., sec. 157. 4. The plaintiffs were not required to take any active steps against John Hanen, the principal in the note sued on, but had a right to remain inactive and depend for protection on the sureties on said note. Rev. Stats., art. 3660; Hunter v. Clark, 28 Texas, 162; Brandt on Sure. and Guar., secs. 208, 290, 391. Mathews & Wood, for appellees. 1. The case was tried on certain facts agreed on and on special issues submitted to the jury; and no question being raised, either on motion for a new trial or by the assignments of error, as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, the statement of facts can only be considered in passing upon the exceptions saved to the exclusion of testimony. Rev. Stats., arts. 1331, 1332, 1333; Sutton v. Carabajal, 26 Texas, 497; Farris v. Bennett, 26 Texas, 568; Raines v. Calloway, 27 Texas, 679; Ledyard v. Brown, 27 Texas, 406; Young v. Van Benthuysen, 30 Texas, 763; Smith v. Warren, 60 Texas, 462. 2. Appellees having become sureties on the note sued on, which was a debt of Hanen’s, and by the terms of the mortgage was secured thereby, parol evidence was not admissible to show that it was not the intention of appellants and Hanen that the note should be secured by the mortgages. Wilson v. Childress, 2 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 427; Johnson v. Brown, 51 Texas, 65; Jones v. Cavasos, 29 Texas, 428. 3. While the failure to record the mortgages only operated as a release of appellees to the extent of the loss sustained by such failure to record, yet the burden of proving the value of the property thus rendered unavailable for the payment of the secured debts was upon appellants; and neither the testimony nor the findings of the jury showing the value of such property, the presumption is that such value was sufficient to pay the secured indebtedness. Murrell v. Scott, 51 Texas, 520, 526; Brandt on Sure., secs. 370, 386, 387. 4. Under the circumstances existing at the time and the relations existing between appellants and appellees, the appellants did not have a right to remain inactive, allow Hanen to ship 320 head of the mortgaged slieep out of the State, and depend for protection on the sureties on the note sued on."
"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Appellee bought an excursion ticket from Galveston to San Antonio and return, via the International & Great Northern Railway from Galveston to Houston and the Southern Pacific from Houston to San Antonio. When ready to return from San Antonio to Galveston he applied to the agent of the appellant at San Antonio for a sleeping car ticket. The agefit required him to produce his railroad ticket, which the appellee did, and then sold appellee a ticket for a berth on the sleeper San Pedro from San Antonio to Galveston, for which he paid the agent the price demanded. On arrival at Houston the car San Pedro was detached from the Southern Pacific train and attached to a Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe train, to be taken to Galveston. After having proceeded a short distance from- Houston, appellee was advised by the conductor of the sleeping car that he could not travel over the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe on his train ticket, because it was for passage over the International & Great Northern Railway. He claimed his right to go to Galveston on the San Pedro, but he was told by the railway conductor that he must pay fare or leave the train. Not having money to pay fare, he chose to leave the train, and was, from about six or seven miles out, returned to Houston free of charge on a north bound train over the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway. This action was brought to recover damages for the breach of appellant’s contract to carry the appellee to Galveston in one of its sleeping ears. Plaintiff alleged, that by reason of the breach he suffered much trouble, inconvenience, annoyance, delay, expense, mental pain, and distress. The cause was tried by a jury, and resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $879.15. The sleeping car ticket contained the stipulation, 51 Good for this date and car only, when accompanied by first class railroad ticket; San Antonio to Galveston,” and was sold after defendant’s agent had inspected the plaintiff’s railroad ticket. Plaintiff had no knowledge of any exclusive arrangement between the defendant company and the Gulf, Colorado <& Santa Fe Railway Company, by which the latter should transport the cars of the former from Houston to Galveston, and could rely upon an implied undertaking on the part of the defendant to carry him to Galveston over the route designated in his railroad ticket. It was reasonably within the contemplation of the parties when the sleeping car ticket was sold and the contract of carriage entered into, that the plaintiff would be subject to ejection from defendant’s car for nonpayment of fare, if said car should not be transported to Galveston over the route called for, which was the International & Great Northern Railway. Hence the measure of damage would be for such mental suffering or feeling of humiliation as attended the ejection as a direct result therefrom, and such inconvenience, expense, and loss of time as might be shown to be the direct, natural, and proximate result of the breach of the contract to carry. Railway v. Gilbert, 64 Texas, 536; Railway v. Terry, 62 Texas, 380. Plaintiff was permitted to testify, over the objection of the defendant, that upon his return to Houston he experienced mental distress by reason of his not arriving at Galveston on the morning of the same dajq and from the apprehension that his delay might cause him to be discharged from his employer’s service, and from the fear that he could not get to Galveston in time to make a remittance to his principal, according to his usual custom of transacting business with his principal. The causes for damages shown by this evidence, other than such mental worry as might ordinarily attend his delay in reaching Galveston, were not reasonably within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into, and if cause for damages at all, it should have been alleged and proved by the plaintiff that the facts were known to the defendant at the time, and that plaintiff was liable by reason of the condition of his business affairs to suffer loss if he should not reach Galveston in the morning rather than in the evening. For the same reason the court erred also in the admission of the evidence of W. T. Wall, a witness for the plaintiff, as well as for the further reason that part of this testimony was the mere opinion of the witness. Plaintiff was permitted to show that he did not have sufficient money to pay his fare to Galveston, as a reason why he did not pay fare and continue on his journey, instead of suffering himself to be ejected. The defendant objected to the evidence as irrelevant and immaterial, and that there was neither allegation nor evidence that the state of the witness’ resources was communicated or known to defendant when the ticket was purchased, and that the damages that might result from the fact were not in the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made. A passenger will not be required to pay fare twice, or fare in excess of the proper fare, to prevent the damages resulting from a wrongful ejection by the carrier. Railway v. Mackie, 71 Texas, 491. But in this case no additional fare was demanded by the defendant, and the ejection was made for the failure of the plaintiff to pay the railroad fare, and we think that under the circumstances it was the duty of the plaintiff to pay the railroad fare if he had the money, so as not to aggravate the damages, the rule being that he must use reasonable care to prevent the aggravation of damages; and for this reason the evidence was admissible. Defendant requested the following charge, the refusal of which is assigned as error: “ By the issuance of the sleeping car ticket by the agent at San Antonio, the defendant assumed no liability for any breach thereof that might occur, unless damage should follow such breach, and such damage was proximate to the breach. “ Defendant is in no event liable for any damage to plaintiff’s feelings, or for his mental distress growing out of his failure to get to Galveston at the regular morning hour of arrival of the train which he left at the switch, or growing out of his fear of discharge from service in the sewing machine company.” There was no error in refusing this instruction, because, while the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover for mental anxiety occasioned by his failure to reach Galveston on account of special business considerations, still his general discomfort and inconvenience growing out of such failure would be proper elements of damage. As the judgment of the court below will be reversed for the error indicated with reference to the admission of evidence, it will not be necessary to pass upon the assignment of error, that the verdict of the jury is excessive in amount, nor those relating to the language of plaintiff’s counsel in examining the witness Curry and in his opening remarks to the jury, as they also relate to the probable prejudice of the jury in assessing damages which are assigned as excessive. The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and, remanded. Delivered February 23, 1893.","Pullman Palace Car Company v. D. McDonald. No. 88. 1. Sleeping Car Tickets — Measure of Damages.—Appellee’s ticket from San Antonio to Galveston was via Southern Pacific Railway to Houston, and via International & Great Northern from thence to Galveston. After its inspection, appellant's agent in San Antonio sold appellee a ticket for a berth on the sleeper San Pedro, from San Antonio to Galveston. At Houston the sleeper was attached to a Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe train, and appellee, about six miles-from Houston, was put off the train because his railway ticket did not entitle him to ride on that train, and because he refused to pay fare, having no money. It was reasonably within the contemplation of the parties when the sleeping car ticket was sold, that appellee would be subject to ejection from the sleeper for nonpayment of railway fare, if the sleeper was not transported to Galveston over the route called for, and the measure of damages would be such expense, loss of time, and mental suffering as directly resulted therefrom. 2. Mental Suffering not within the Contemplation of the Parties.—Plaintiff was permitted to testify to his mental distress, after his return to Houston, by reason of his not arriving at Galveston on the morning of the same day, and his apprehension of discharge from his employer’s service by reason thereof, and his inability to make remittance to his principal according to his usual custom. (He was a sewing machine agent.) These causes of damage were not reasonably within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was entered into, and if cause for damage at all, should have been alleged, and defendant's knowledge of them proved. 3. Evidence that Plaintiff had no Money was admissible, although it was not alleged that the state of plaintiff's resources was known to defendant. It was the duty of plaintiff to pay the railroad fare if he had the money, because he must use reasonable care not to aggravate the damages, and for this reason the evidence was admissible. 4. Damages — General Discomfort and Inconvenience. — Though plaintiff would not be entitled to recover for mental anxiety occasioned by his-failure to reach Galveston, on account of special business considerations, still his general discomfort and inconvenience growing out of such failure would be proper elements of damage. Appeal from Galveston. Tried below before Hon. Wh. H. Stewart'. Hume & Kleberg, for appellant. 1. Upon a breach of contract, the damages which the injured party is entitled to recover for such breach are such as may fairly and reasonably be considered as arising naturally— that is, according to the usual course of things—from the breach itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract as a probable result of a breach of it. Express Co. v. Darnell Bros., 62 Texas, 639; Greenwood v. Pierce, 58 Texas, 130; Brandon v. Manufacturing Co., 51 Texas, 121; Seale v.

The court erred in allowing plaintiff’s counsel, over the objection of defendant, to ask his witness W. T. Wall whether plaintiff suffered mental distress by reason of having to leave the train, and to what such mental distress, if any, was due; plaintiff’s counsel stating his purpose to be to prove by witness that plaintiff did suffer mental distress by reason of having to leave the car, and that such distress was due to his anxiety to reach Galveston Monday morning, and to his apprehension of discharge by his employer, and to his desire to remit to his employer that day.

Lovejoy & Sampson, for appellee. 1. In a suit against a carrier for improperly putting a passenger off of one of its cars, general allegations of damage are sufficient to admit proof of such damages as naturally and necessarily follow the wrongful act. Mental suffering, discomfiture, inconvenience, expense, etc., are .the natural and proximate results of the breach of the contract, and are implied and need not be plead. Railway v.

It was the duty of plaintiff to have paid the train fare if he had the money or could have gotten it; because where one person is injured in person or property by the negligence of another, it is the duty of such party not to aggravate the damages, but, to the contrary, to use reasonable care, diligence, and prudence to lessen or limit the damages; and if he fails in this duty, he can only charge the defendant with such damages as would have resulted had the duty been performed. 1 Suth. on Dam.. 148; 3 Suth. on Dam., 729; Field on Dam., 130."
"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This suit was brought in the District Court of Parker County by appellant, against appellee, to recover the sum of $90.27, amount of a promissory note, with interest, and to foreclose the vendor’s lien on certain land described in the petition. The defendant relied as a special defense upon a partial failure of consideration arising out of the deficiency in the quantity of land. The court tried the case without a jury and rendered judgment for the defendant; hence this appeal. 1. November 18,1881, the Franco-Texan Land Company by deed conveyed to defendant the land on which foreclosure is sought. 2. This deed by metes and bounds sets out the land conveyed, and concludes the description therein with the recital that the land contains “ 102.59 acres, more or less, being the southwest fractional part of survey No. 327.” The instrument recites a consideration of $82.07 cash, the balance secured in six promissory notes, the last of which is the one here involved. It expressly retains the vendor’s lien, and provides that the deed shall become absolute as a conveyance on payment of all the notes. 3. The land conveyed is out of a larger tract owned by appellant, through patent from the State, recorded February 20, 1878. The patent describes the entire tract as containing 511.79 acres. The tract, however, does not contain this quantity, because the calls for distance are required to yield to the calls in the patent for marked lines and corners. 4. At the time of the purchase the plaintiff, vendor, represented to the defendant that there were 102.59 acres in the tract conveyed. The defendant relied upon these representations, and so purchased the land. There was no actual fraud on the part of the vendor, both the vendor and vendee believing at the time that the tract contained the quantity named. 5. There were, however, only 85 acres embraced in the tract conveyed. The deficiency is caused by the calls for distance being controlled by calls for lines and corners marked and established. 6. The sale was a sale by the acre — that is to say, that in arriving at the price the parties estimated the tract to contain 102.59 acres — and the price agreed upon was $4 per acre. 7. Soon after the purchase the defendant moved on the land and has ever since resided thereon, undisturbed in his title or possession of the land actually conveyed to him. He did not, however, discover the deficiency until after he had paid the purchase money notes, except the last, which is here sued upon. 8. The deficiency in the land, 17.59 acres, at $4 per acre, exceeds the amount of the note involved, with interest. We do not concur with appellant in its first contention, that the answer of defendant is subject to general demurrer. The answer, in effect, alleges that the land was sold by the acre; that the plaintiff falsely represented that there were 102.59 acres in the tract; that defendant relied on these false representations, and was by them induced to purchase; that there was a shortage of 17.59 acres, which defendant did not discover until after the payment of the fifth note; that plaintiff knew of the discrepancy at the time of the sale to defendant. The answer prayed an abatement of the price to the extent of the value of the deficiency. We believe the correct doctrine to be, that where land is sold by the acre, and the parties are under a mutual mistake as to the quantity conveyed, or where the vendee is moved to the purchase by the false representations of the vendor, even though innocently made, and the deficiency is afterwards discovered, equity will grant to the vendee a proportionate abatement of the purchase price. The vendee may seek this relief under a plea of partial failure of consideration, setting up the mistake or the false representations. Mitchell v. Zimmerman, 4 Texas, 75; Walling v. Kennard, 10 Texas, 508; Moore v. Hazelwood, 67 Texas, 626; Wheeler v. Boyd, 69 Texas, 298. This rule does not obtain in the absence of actual fraud, when the sale is in gross; and it would seem that the deed unexplained and for a designated number of acres “ more or less,” would, if its execution and delivery be unaccompanied by an understanding to the contrary, indicate a sale in gross, and not by the acre. Bellamy v. McCarthy, 75 Texas, 294. It does not follow, however, that the vendee in the deed containing the recital “ more or less” will thereby be precluded, under allegations of fraud or mistake, from pleading and proving an agreement contemporaneous with the execution of the deed, making the transaction a sale by the acre and not in gross. In this case, under the allegations of the answer, the defendant was the victim of misrepresentation; the quantity of land sold was of the “ essence of the contract,” and “ the deficiency is so great as to have been material.” Equity under such circumstances will grant relief, although the land is described in the deed as so many acres, “ more or less.” Smith v. Fly, 24 Texas, 351. Delivered December 13, 1892. It follows, from the views above expressed, that we also differ from appellant in its succeeding contention, that the court erred in admitting the parol testimony of the defendant to show the transaction to have been a sale by the acre and not in gross. Under the allegations of the answer, showing fraud or mistake, this testimony was admissible, not so much for the purpose of contradicting the deed as for the purpose, with reference to the entire transaction, of indicating the proper interpretation of the expression “ more or less ” contained in the deed. Smith v. Fly, 24 Texas, 351; Weir v. McGee, 25 Texas Supp., 31. We think there was ample evidence to sustain the finding of fact and to justify the conclusion of law by the court that the transaction was a sale by the acre and not in gross. The judgment is therefore affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Stephens did not sit in this case.","Franco-Texan Land Company v. A. B. Simpson. No. 33. 1. Deed — Rule where there is a Shortage in Land. — Where land is sold by the acre, and the parties are under a mutual mistake as to the quantity conveyed, or where the vendee is moved to the purchase by the false representations of the vendor as to the amount, even though innocently made, and the deficiency is afterward discovered, equity will grant to the vendee a proportionate abatement of the purchase price. 2. Same — Sale in Gross — “More or Less.” — The above rule does not obtain in the absence of actual fraud when the sale is in gross; and it would seem that the deed unexplained, and for a designated number or acres "" more or less,” would, if its execution or delivery be unaccompanied by an understanding to the contrary, indicate a sale in gross, and not by the acre. 3. Same. — But where the vendee is the victim of misrepresentation; where the sale is by the acre and the quantity of the land is of the essence of the contract, and the deficiency is so great as to have been material, equity will grant relief, although the land is described in the deed as so many acres “ more or less.” 4. Parol Evidence to Explain Deed. — Under proper allegations of fraud or mistake, a sale by deed reciting the land as so many acres more or less may be shown by parol evidence to have been in fact a sale by the acre, and not in gross.

Ward, 12 Texas, 209; Silver v. Frazier, 81 Am. Dec., 662. 2. Where a deed of conveyance of land mentions the number of acres, and also contains a description of the land by metes and bounds, or contains the words “ more or less,” the call for the number of acres is a mere descriptive call, and does not entitle the vendee to an abatement of price in the event the tract contains a less number of acres than that named in the conveyance.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Action for damages from personal injuries received by appellee while engaged in the service of appellant repairing cars. Judgment was recovered for $3500. The suit.was instituted November 13, 1888, and on a former trial appellant recovered judgment for $6000, which was reversed by the Supreme Court because the amount of the judgment was excessive. 78 Texas, 657. At the time of the injury plaintiff was 25 years old. He was by occupation a house carpenter, and had been in the employ of defendant about three months in its repair yard at Palestine, repairing cars. On October 11, 1888, he was engaged at work with other workmen putting a sill in the end of a flat car. He, was between two cars, which stood two or three feet apart, when a switch engine which ran in on the repair track struck the cars' in front of him, and pushed the car on which he was at work against the next car, and broke his arm below the elbow. A. T. Wood was foreman of the switch engine, and had charge of it in making up trains and putting cars where they belonged. Cars in bad order were taken out of trains and switched on to the repair tracks. The foreman of the switch engine or a switchman would throw the switch for that purpose. On the day of the accident Wood went in on the repair track with the switch engine to get out a couple of cars. He said: “We hallooed out to look out, the same we always do when we want to go in. I think the bell was ringing at the time. That was all the engineer had to do, and the fireman even did that. It was his duty to ring the bell, and besides that we hallooed to look out on that occasion. There were no flags out, and I did not see anybody under the cars.” There were a number of engines moving in the yards and bells were ringing; the shops were close by, and they were noisy from the beating of metal, the running of machinery, and the men at work. Plaintiff testified, that he did not know that the engine was coming in, and that the first that he knew that anything was going to happen the cars were coming against him, and he did not have time to get out; that no one had given him notice, and that no notice at all was given. That the company had never given him any instructions about any rules it liad for giving notice, and he did not know whether they had any rules or not; that he supposed they would protect him, and that they had rules suffi-' cient for that purpose. Plaintiff was employed in the car building department, of which one, Siddons was master; he worked under a foreman named Williams, but Siddons had the authority to employ the men. Whenever the switch engine went on to the repair track to take ears in or to bring them out, the usual notice was to halloo “ look out,” and the bell was kept ringing while the engine was moving. It was usual for the switchman or the foreman of the engine to halloo out to the men on the repair track whenever an engine came in. The switches leading to the repair track were kept locked, and the switchman carried the key and unlocked the switch whenever it was necessary to run in an engine. There were rules to protect the men working on the repair tracks. When an engine was about to go in on a track the rules were for the switchmen to notify the men by ringing the bell of the engine and also to halloo to the men. The foreman of the repair yard would also, if he were there, notify them. It was the duty of both the foreman of the engine and the foreman of the men to give notice. It was the rule that somebody must always, give notice. There was a conflict of evidence as to the use of flags. It was testified that the company furnished the workmen with flags, which were stuck up on the track, and that when a flag was up it was forbidden to touch a car with the engine. There was no flag up when plaintiff was injured. Some of the evidence showed that flags had not been brought into use when the accident occurred. With respect to the injury, the plaintiff testified that his right arm was broken just below the elbow and a mark was left where it was broken; that he could not use it at all for about four months; that the arm was about a half-inch shorter and was weaker than it was before, and he could not lift much that was heavy with it; that it hurt him when he worked. It diminished his capacity as a carpenter. Before he was injured he could make $2.50 a day, but since he could only make 82.25. He worked for the defendant at 82, but that was because he got a steady job. The occupation of a carpenter required heavy lifting, and he could do no heavy work. He could not use a plane as long and as well as before, nor reach to nail overhead without a great deal of inconvenience. That his arm seemed stiff, and he could not turn his hand up without bending his elbow in toward his body; this arm was not so large as the other since it was broken, and the development of the muscle had been affected; it was not so large. The bone bulged out where it was broken. Dr. West, a physician, testified, that the rotation of the arm was destroyed by the formation of callus between the two bones which united them; that the bone was broken near the joint, and it was unusual for a fracture of that kind to leave any use at all; that it was a comminuted fracture — that is, the bone had been broken in pieces. The arm had been shortened, he thought, from the overlapping of the bones. In a lateral strain plaintiff could bear as much pressure as he ever could, but not as much in lifting at right angles. With the bones grown together and lapped an injury of that kind would last plaintiff as long as he lived. lie thought both bones had been broken. Dr. Colley testified, that it was a simple fracture of the ulna, the inner bone of the right arm; that the arm was well, and he did not see why plaintiff could not use it as well as he could before; there was a protuberance which might grow less. Dr. Colley was defendant company’s surgeon and treated plaintiff in the hospital of the company to which he had been taken after the accident. Dr. West had examined plaintiff’s arm and was familiar with' its condition. Appellant has assigned errors: 1. That the verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence, because the evidence showed that plaintiff had worked in the yard about three months before the injury, and knew all about the rules and regulations under which that work was carried on, and the methods adopted and practiced to protect the men at work, had never complained, and therefore assumed the risk of such imperfect methods, if they were imperfect. 2. The verdict of the jury was excessive in amount, under the evidence. 3. There was error in permitting plaintiff, over defendant’s objection, to prove that defendant caused danger flags to be used after plaintiff’s injury. On the former appeal of this case the charge of the court below was the same that was given on the trial from which this appeal is had, and the Supreme Court then approved the charge, and said: “It was the duty of defendant to establish regulations which would have advised its servants who were engaged in moving cars on to the track where plaintiff was at work of his position, and it should also have provided adequate means of warning them of the approaching danger.” 78 Texas, 660. That the means of warning plaintiff of the approach of danger were inadequate, is involved in the finding of the jury under the charge of the court; and no question of that is made by the appellant; but the question is, that the plaintiff was aware of the means used and should not have continued in defendant’s service without complaint; that by doing so, he assumed whatever risk there was in so continuing. The court correctly instructed the jury, that if the defendant had failed to establish reasonable rules to protect employes, and plaintiff knew this, or by the use of ordinary care might have known it, and still continued in the employment exposed to such danger, he could not recover. Whether the plaintiff knew of the rules established for the protection of the workmen, or by the exercise of ordinary care might have known them, was a question for the determination of the jury, and for us to set aside the verdict in this respect we should be able to say that plaintiff, from his service of three months in the repair yard of the defendant, was bound to know what means, if any, were provided for the protection of the workmen, for he testified that the company had never given him any instructions as to what rules it had about giving notice; that he did not know whether it liad any rules or not, but that he was working under the supposition that it would protect him and that the rules were sufficient for that purpose; and the only evidence from which we could infer that he knew the rules, or might have known of them, was the time of service. The defendant would not be liable for the negligence of a fellow servant of the plaintiff if it furnished adequate means and rules for the protection of the plaintiff while at work; nor would the defendant be liable, although the means furnished and the rules established were inadequate, if the plaintiff had knowledge thereof, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence might have liad knowledge thereof, and voluntarily continued in the service of the defendant. But if the precautions taken by the defendant were inadequate, and the plaintiff did not know what precautions were being taken, and was not chargeable with the want of ordinary care in failing to ascertain what the precautions were, then the defendant would be liable. We can not say that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence in failing, within the time he was in the service of the defendant, to ascertain the precautions that were being used. He was relying on the defendant to protect him, and it not having been shown that anything had occurred to attract plaintiff’s attention to just what precautions were being taken, we do not feel authorized to say that three months service in the yard would be considered evidence of negligence on his part. While the amount of the verdict may seem large, yet plaintiff has received a permanent injury, and the usefulness of his right arm has been impaired for life. It does not appear that the jury was influenced by passion or prejudice, and we will not disturb the verdict. It has been held that it is error to admit evidence of changes on the part of a railway company to improve the service after an accident, and properly so, although the change should have been suggested and caused by the accident itself, because it is for the public good that the operation of railways should be rendered as safe as possible. ■ But the evidence objected to, as to the use of the flags after the accident had occurred, was in rebuttal of the testimony of the witness Siddons, that flags were kept for use by employes before and at the time of Hall’s injury, and plaintiff offered the evidence for the purpose of showing that the custom of using flags was after and not before the injury to plaintiff. The evidence was to show when the flags were used, and not to show negligence by failure to use them; and the court admitted it for the purpose for which it was offered alone, and so instructed the jury. There was no error in the admission of the evidence under the circumstances. Delivered November 3, 1892. We find no error in the record, and the judgment of the court below will be affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Williams did not sit in this case.","International & Great Northern Railway Company v. J. B. Hall. No. 17. 1. Case Approved. — The International & Great Northern Railway Company v. J. B. Hall, 78 Texas, C57, approved. 2. Knowledge of Rules a Question for Jury. — Whether the plaintiff (a workman in the employ of the company) knew of the rules established for the protection of the workmen, or by the exercise of ordinary care might have known them, was a question for the determination of the jury; and for us to set aside the verdict in this respect we should be able to say that plaintiff, from his service of three months in the repair yard of defendant, was bound to know what means, if any, were provided for the protection of the workmen. 3. Inadequate Precautions — Liability of Company. — Defendant would not be liable for the negligence of a fellow servant of plaintiff if it furnished adequate means and rules for the protection of plaintiff while at work, nor would it be liable, although the means furnished and the rules established were inadequate, if the plaintiff had knowledge thereof, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence might have had, and voluntarily continued in its service. But if the precautions taken by defendant were inadequate, and plaintiff did not know what precautions were being taken, and was not chargeable with want of ordinary care in failing to ascertain them, then defendant would be liable. 4. Evidence of Changes made After Accident. — Evidence of improved methods adopted by the company after the accident, and in consequence thereof, is not primarily admissible; but when admitted in rebuttal of the evidence of the opposite party, and the jury in the charge are specially instructed as to the purpose for which it has been admitted, such action is not ground for reversal. 5.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellee resided at Navasota,Grimes County, and his brother Henry resided at Allen, in Collin County. On the 24th day of March, 1890, the wife of Henry Bennett delivered to appellant, at Allen, the following message, addressed to appellee at Navasota, “ Come at once; Henry is dying.” The message was transmitted at once to Navasota and was received there at 8:50 o’clock a. m. of the same day. It was not delivered to appellee until the afternoon of March 26. On that day, before its delivery, appellee had learned from other sources of the dangerous illness of his brother, and went to appellant’s office in Navasota for the purpose of ascertaining, by wire, his condition, and the message was then delivered to him. Thereupon he sent over appellant’s line a dispatch to his brother’s wife, asking information as to her husband’s condition. This message was not delivered to Mrs. Bennett until next day. Appellant, failing to receive an answer, took the train at Navasota the night of the 26th and went to Allen, when he learned that his brother had died on the 25tli and was buried on the 26th. He brought this suit to recover damages for the failure to deliver both messages. At the trial he was permitted to introduce, over appellant’s objections, the copies of the messages delivered to him and to his sister-in-law-, respectively. The objection was that the original messages delivered to appellant were the primary evidence. Appellee also introduced evidence of the sending of the message from himself to Mrs. Bennett, and the date of the delivery of the same, and of the fact that no answer was received, which was objected to by appellant, on the ground that it was irrelevant and calculated to mislead the jury. The court charged the jury, that they would not consider the evidence as to the last message, and that appellee could not recover damages growing out of it. Appellant sought to excuse its failure to deliver the message to appellee by showing that he was unknown to its agents, and that they used due diligence to find him in Navasota, and failed to do so. The evidence upon this point was conflicting. There was positive testimony in behalf of appellee that he had resided in Navasota for three months, was well known there, and was at home in town, and could easily have been found during the whole of the 24th, 25th, and 26th of March; and that his residence was in fact pointed out to appellant’s messenger while the latter was searching for him. This last fact was denied by appellant’s witness, and there was testimony strongly tending to show that appellee left Navasota on the 23d and went to a neighborhood about twenty-five miles away, and did not return until the evening of the 25th. It is not controverted that appellee’s wife was at home during this time. Appellant, however, claims that its agents could not learn anything of such persons in Navasota. It was shown that about noon of the 24th appellant’s messenger reported to its operator at Navasota that appellee could not be found, and that the operator notified appellant’s agent at Allen. The latter informed Mrs. Bennett, and she then informed the operator at Allen, that appellee was not in Navasota, but was near Bryan, and sent him a message, over appellant’s line, to that place. The admission of the copies of the telegrams delivered by appellant’s agents, on which the suit is founded, was not error. Lumber Co. v. Tel. Co., 58 Texas, 394. Nor was there error in the admission of evidence as to the sending and delay in delivering the telegram from appellee to Mrs. Bennett, and the failure of appellee to get a reply. The suit was based in part on those facts, and evidence of them was proper. While appellee failed, in the opinion of the court below, to show a right to recover growing out of that transaction, this could not render erroneous the ruling admitting the evidence. The alleged declaration of the messenger boy, whether admissible as original evidence or not, was competent to contradict him, and affect his credibility before the jury. But we are of opinion it was admissible as affirmative evidence in appellee’s behalf. The messenger was the agent upon whose acts and investigations the appellant largely relied to show a discharge of its duty to appellee. What he said, while engaged in the search, which might in any degree illustrate the degree of his diligence and the good faith of his efforts, was directly pertinent to the issue. The court charged the jury as follows: “The fact that the message was promptly received at Navasota, and that Bennett lived there, being shown, the burden of proof to show that the message was not delivered to Bennett promptly resulted from some excusable cause, is on the defendant, and it must establish such excusable cause by a preponderance of the evidence, by which is meant the greater weight and degree of credible evidence. ’ ’ Appellant contends that the court erred in charging upon the burden of proof at all, and that the rule given was in itself incorrect. We need not consider what facts would ordinarily make out a prima facie case against a telegraph company for damages for delay in delivering a message. If the purpose of the suit was to recover general damages only, and the burden consequently was on plaintiff to show only a breach of contract, the rule laid down in this instruction might be correct. But when the main recovery sought is special damages, such as are here claimed, certainly the burden ought to be on plaintiff to show such a breach of contract; in other words, such negligence in the delivery of the dispatch as caused such damage. Delivered December 15, 1892. The charge of the court nowhere told the jury that the onus in this particular was on plaintiff, and the court refused a special instruction asked by appellant announcing such rule as the law of the case. Again: Whether the burden was on defendant or not, to show the exercise of proper diligence to deliver the message, the real controversy under the evidence was upon the question of fact, whether or not appellee was in Navasota on the 24th and 25th, and the practical effect of the charge given, probably, was to lead the jury to believe that it was incumbent on appellant to show that appellee was elsewhere. We can not assent to this as the law of the case. Appellee’s whereabouts was peculiarly known to himself, and it would be unjust to require appellant to show it. It was required, rather, to explain its own conduct and show proper efforts to deliver the telegram. We do not suppose that the district judge intended to impose the burden on the defendant to show plaintiff’s absence from town, but such was the state of the evidence that this was the application a jury would probably make of the instruction. And this illustrates what seems to us the impropriety of giving such charges upon the burden of proof in cases where the evidence stands as it did here. We think there can be no doubt that both parties introduced evidence sufficient, if true, to discharge any burden cast upon them by the law. The issues, therefore, resolved themselves wholly into questions as to the weight of evidence and credibility of witnesses. Knowledge of the rules regulating the burden of proof at the opening of the trial, or at particular stages of the evidence, could not afford any light to guide the jury in determining what witness was most credible or what fact the most weighty. A case standing thus upon the evidence should be considered as a whole, and not by piecemeal. Railway v. Geiger, 79 Texas, 13. We think the part of the charge which we have quoted was erroneous. Omitting from the charge those parts relating to the burden of proof, it is a very fair and clear submission of the case to the jury. This disposes of all the assignments of error except the sixth and seventh, which are too indefinite to be considered. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. The defendant in error is the administrator de bonis non of the estate of Thomas Barron, deceased. His predecessor in a representative capacity was Katie Barron. As administratrix of the estate of Thomas Barron, she brought this suit against W. W. Bush, J. J. Hittson, and Jack Hittson, to recover the amount alleged to be due on a promissory note charged to have been executed by W. W. Bush, J. J. Hittson, and Jack Hittson ,and payable ‘ ‘to the order of Katie Barron, administratrix estate of Thomas Barron.” The judgment was rendered against these defendants in favor of the successor, G. W. Gentry, administrator and defendant in error. From this judgment Jack Hittson prosecutes this writ of error. The judgment was had by default upon an amended petition. The original petition described the cause of action, with other elements of description, as a promissory nóte for the sum of $4325, and with credits thereon as follows: $200 September 24, 1886; $434.95 November 1, 1886. The amended petition on which judgment was taken described the cause of action as a promissory note for the sum of $4325, without credits. Among other matters assigned as error (a discussion of which we waive, because unnecessary), the judgment is complained of as erroneous on account of the excess in the amount in the amended over that claimed in the original petition. It is apparent that the plaintiff in error was not served with notice of the amended petition. It may well be apprehended that a defendant who would not resist a demand for $3690.05, due upon the cause of action as described here in the original petition, would strenuously contest a claim for $4325 as described in the amended petition. This difference, according to our calculation, was carried into the judgment rendered against the plaintiff in error. The cause of action as set out in the amended petition was, we think, a new cause of action, and differed from that originally declared upon. The defendant Jack Hittson therefore was, in our opinion, entitled to notice of the amended petition. Without such notice he was deprived of the opportunity and the right to contest the demand, the validity of which was decreed against him. Such a judgment is erroneous. Morrison v. Walker, 22 Texas, 18; Stewart v. Anderson, 70 Texas, 598. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 30, 1893.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This suit was originally brought by appellant, to recover from Eppie Robertson and G-. B. F. Maxwell certain real estate situated in Cooke County. Charles M. Stevens intervened in the suit, claiming the property in controversy. Isaac Cloud was the common source of title. The controversy turns upon the priority of the judgment and execution liens under which appellant and appellees respectively deraign title from the common source. The record contains conclusions of fact, which we adopt, with the qualification stated below. As the judgment lien under which appellees claim is prior in time to that of appellant, its validity presents the first question for determination. This judgment was obtained by Charles M. Stevens in the Federal Court at Dallas, Texas, against Isaac Cloud and others, and the abstract, which was duly filed, recorded, and indexed in the record of abstracts of judgments of Cooke County, reads as follows: “In the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas, at Dallas.—I, A. J. Houston, clerk of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas, at Dallas, do hereby certify, that in said court, on the 22d day of May, 1885, the plaintiff recovered judgment against the defendants, A. J. Addington, Isaac Cloud, and Z. T. Addington, for the sum of $11,589.30, all of which said judgment is yet due, with interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from its date, in cause number 767, and styled Charles M. Stevens v. A. J. Addington et al., all of which appears from the records of said court.” Then follows the authentication of the clerk in due form. The sole objection taken to the sufficiency of this abstract, upon which the trial court held it to be invalid, was, that it did not show the amount of costs recovered, it being made to appear by the proof that the costs taxed in that case amounted to $61. In passing upon an abstract very similar to this one, made by the same clerk, which recited, after giving the amount of the judgment and the rate of interest, without stating the amount of the costs, that “all of which said judgment and costs is yet due and unpaid,” the Federal Supreme Court, Chief Justice Fuller delivering the opinion, in a recent case disposed of the objection raised, that it did not show the amount due thereon, by a single sentence, as follows: “ The only ground on which this abstract and index could be held insufficient was, that the names of the plaintiffs were not given in full in either abstract or index.” The ■ opinion reviews the decisions of our Supreme Court construing the judgment lien statute, and concludes that the names of all the members of a plaintiff firm need not be shown either by the abstract or index. Cooke v. Avery, U. S. Sup. Ct., decided January 23, 1893, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep., 340. Without determining whether our courts should follow that decision in this respect, we are of opinion that it is correct in holding, that the statute is substantially, if not literally, complied with, so far as stating the amount due upon the judgment is concerned, when the abstract shows the amount for which the judgment was rendered, exclusive of costs, and the rate of interest which it bears, and states that the total amount remains due and unpaid. It seems to us, that it would at least create a lien for that amount, if not for the amount of the costs. If this conclusion be correct, it will lead to an affirmance of the judgment. In the court’s second findings of facts, in passing upon the abstract and index of the judgment subsequently rendered and recorded against Cloud and others, under which appellant claimed, the only objection sustained was, that it was indexed under the letter B as follows: Bank, First National of Decatur. In addition to this finding, it appears from the statement of facts, that the record of this abstract did not contain the authentication of the clerk, if, indeed, the abstract itself had been certified. Without passing upon the merits of these objections, we have reached the conclusion, that if by reason of a stricter construction than we have adopted, the record of the Stevens abstract be held bad, that of the Decatur bank must for the same reason be held invalid also. If then the judgment liens be both excluded from consideration, and the rights of the parties be determined by the execution sales under which they claim respectively, the judgment must be affirmed, because the levy and sale under the Stevens judgment antedated the bank’s levy and sale. These conclusions render the other issues raised in the case wholly immaterial, and they will therefore not be considered. The judgment will be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 16, 1893.","First National Bank of Decatur v. Isaac Cloud et al. No. 116. 1.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This suit was brought by J. J. Fisher against E.R. Stiff, as principal, and Gabe Beck, as guarantor, to recover the sum of $10,200, on account of the alleged failure of Stiff to deliver to Fisher 2000 head of. yearling steers, as provided in a contract entered into between them on the 21st day of December, 1889. By the terms of' this contract these cattle were to be delivered about the 20th day of April,. 1890, at or near Valley View, in Cooke County, Texas, after being classed and passed upon at Stiff’s ranch in Collin and Denton counties; but to be-counted at Valley View. The steers were to be a good, smooth lot of merchantable cattle, free from defects, and of full age .at the time of delivery; and were to be bought in Collin, Grayson, Ellis, and Dallas counties. The price agreed upon was $7 per head, to be paid as follows: $4000 cash (which was paid), $3000 about the 10th of January, 1890 (which was also paid), and the balance at the time of delivery. This contract was made by J. J. Fisher, through his agent, P. S. Witherspoon, who was to drive the cattle from the Stiff ranch, but Fisher was not to be responsible for losses until after they were counted at Valley View. A further advance payment of $1200 was afterwards made, under circumstances which, if, appellee’s witnesses be deemed credible, would warrant the inference that the money was obtained by falsely representing or fraudulently concealing material facts on the part of Stiff. No cattle having been delivered on or before April 20, 1890, appelleesued to recover the money paid on the contract and the difference between the contract price and the market value, in the total sum above named. Attachment writs were sued out at the same time, to-wit, on the 22d day of April, 1890, upon the grounds, (1) that Stiff had disposed of liis property with intent to defraud his creditors, and (2) that the debt sued for was due for money obtained under false pretenses. The cattle of Stiff in Grayson, Collin, and Denton counties were levied on under these attachments and replevied by him. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee for $9200, and from the judgment approving this verdict this appeal was taken. 1. Appellant Stiff moved to quash the attachment, because the same was based upon a claim for unliquidated damages. The overruling of this motion being assigned as error, presents the first question for determination. Near the beginning of the present century Mr. Justice Washington, of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Fisher v. Consequa (2 Wash., 384), in construing the attachment statute of Pennsylvania, in which the words “ debt” and “ demand” occur, while recognizing that in strict law language “ debt” is a precise sum due by express agreement, announced the proposition, “ that the uncertainty of the sum due does not, in the common understanding of mankind, render it less a debt.” That was a case of contract, by which the defendant bound himself to deliver the plaintiff teas of a certain quality and suited to a certain market; and on failure to do so, to pay the difference between teas of such quality and such as should be delivered. In sustaining an attachment sued out to recover the difference, he uses this language: “A promise, whether express or implied, to pay as much as certain goods or labor are worth, or as much as the same kind of goods may sell for on a certain day or at a certain market, or to pay the difference between the value of one kind of goods and another, creates, in common parlance, a debt.” In determining whether the attachment should issue, he applied this test: The demand must arise out of a contract, without which no debt can be created, and the measure of the damages must be such as the plaintiff can aver by affidavit to be due. These principles have been applied in many subsequent cases, though the decisions are not uniform. Drake on Attach., secs. 12-23. It is true, in that case there was an express promise to pay this difference; while in the case here submitted there was but an implied promise to pay the difference between the contract price and market value at the time and place of delivery. In some of the cases, however, cited by Mr. Drake above, there was no express promise. We are of opinion that the words “ debt” and “ demand,” as used in our attachment statute, should not be so restricted in their meaning and scope as appellants contend, and that no error was committed in overruling the motion to quash the attachment. While a strict compliance on the part of the attaching creditor with the statute has been steadily enforced in this State, it seems to us that in construing the meaning of the law itself, to adopt an illiberal rule is to disregard the expressed will of the Legislature. Rev. Stats., Final Title, sec. 3; see, also, Hochstadler Bros. v. Sam, 73 Texas, 315; Wilson v. Wilson, 50 Am. Dec., 685; And. Law Die., 315; 1 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law., 986. 2. Another defense interposed by appellants is, that about the 1st of April, 1890, a new contract was entered into between the parties, materially changing, and abrogating to the extent of the changes, the old one. We find from the evidence, that about the date named Stiff and P. S. Weatherspoon, as agent for Fisher, and also for J. R. Stevens, who had a similar contract for the delivery of 1500 cattle, in view of the fact that Stiff had a part of the cattle ready for delivery, and that Fisher and Stevens were desirous of receiving them earlier than the date specified in the original contracts, agreed that Stiff might, instead of making one delivery of all the cattle about the 20th of April, deliver 1500 or 2000 of them on the 10th of April and the rest on the 1st of May; and that the cattle should be counted at Stiff’s ranch instead of Valley View, upon Stiff’s furnishing the pens and fuel necessary for branding the cattle. The parties made preparation to deliver and receive the cattle in accordance with this arrangement. To this end one R. M. Sloan and Chris. Brooks, in the employ of Fisher and Stevens, under the direction of Witherspoon, proceeded at once with their men and horses to the ranch of Stiff, in Den-ton County, to brand and receive the cattle. Appellants complain that the court refused to give their requested instruction, to the effect that if the jury should find that the contract sued on was afterwards so altered and changed ■ that a different period of delivery was agreed on, and said subsequent agreement was afterwards relied upon and accepted by the parties in substitution of the original agreement, to find for the defendants. The court charged, in effect, of which complaint is made, that the substituted contract as alleged by defendants would not prevent the plaintiff from maintaining his action upon the original contract, unless it appeared that the new contract had in fact been performed by defendant, or that he was ready, willing, and able to perform the same according to its terms; and to find for defendant in the event defendant had offered to perform his part of the new contract, and was ready, willing, and able to do so. It seems to us that the exact time and place of the delivery were not of the essence of the original contract, which provided that the delivery should be made at or near Valley View, and about the 20th day of April. These slight changes as to details in executing the original contract seem to us to have been made by the parties for their mutual convenience, in subordination to its main purpose. Without going into the questions of accord and satisfaction and accord without satisfaction, so ably discussed by counsel, we have reached the conclusion, that unless Stiff was ready, willing, and able to avail himself of the privilege of the first delivery at his ranch in Denton County, he could not insist upon the right of the second delivery at the same place and at a later date. Under the evidence in this case, it must be held, we think, that the verdict of the jury, which is supported thereby, imports a finding that Stiff intentionally broke his contract with Fisher. These conclusions dispose of the eleventh, thirteenth, and fourteenth assignments. 3. The second assignment of error complains of the admission in evidence of the contracts of one Stevens, made through his agent, P. S. Witherspoon, about the same time and of similar impprt, to-wit, for the delivery of 1500 head of cattle at the same time and place. Stiff having failed, up to the 22d of April, 1890, to deliver any cattle under either contract, attempted to prove on the trial of this case that he had more cattle ready to deliver than was required to fill the Fisher contract. We think it was compentent for appellee to prove in rebuttal, or even as original evidence in developing his case, that Stiff had obligated himself to deliver cattle at the same time and place in fulfillment of the Stevens contract also. In fact, Witherspoon was the common agent of Fisher and Stevens, and the transactions were too intimately blended to fully investigate the one without acquiring knowledge of the other. The scope of this evidence was properly limited, as shown in the court’s explanation appended to the bill of exceptions, and the reasons there stated for its admission seem to us to be entirely sufficient. 4. The fourth assignment of error challenges the correctness of the court’s ruling in admitting testimony to prove the market value of the class of cattle called for in the contract in Cooke County generally, instead of limiting it to the value at Valley View. It was shown that there was no market at Valley View different from the market in the county generally; and it seems, therefore, clear to us, that as Valley View was a part of Cooke County, the market value of the county was a proper consideration for the jury. Certainly the proof offered showed the market value “ near,” if not “ at,” Valley View, which was all the contract required. 5. Complaint is made of the court’s action in giving and refusing charges in respect to a certain mortgage executed by Stiff, in favor of the First National Bank of McKinney, on the cattle in Question, to secure an indebtedness of 113,000. The requested instruction, insisted upon as correct by the ninth assignment of error, contains the proposition, that if the debt secured by this mortgage was real and not fictitious, the jury should have been instructed that the giving of this mortgage was not a fraudulent disposition of property. It is clear to us that this charge, if given, would have withdrawn from the jury the consideration whether or not the instrument was in fact executed with a fraudulent intent. The eighth assignment insists, that the court should have instructed the jury that the mortgage of the McKinney bank, if taken with the knowledge of and for money furnished to complete the contract sued upon, would be inferior and subordinate to Fisher’s right to said cattle under Ms contract, and that a seizure by the bank under sequestration proceedings would be subordinate to Fisher’s rights. We are not prepared to say, under the facts contained in this record, that this charge correctly states the law as applicable thereto, and are also of opinion that the charge of the court complained of in the fifteenth assignment on this subject was not erroneous. 6. The third assignment of error reads as follows: “ The court erred in permitting plaintiff to introduce in evidence the declarations and acts of one Mangum, in order to bind defendant Stiff by same, over objections of defendants, * * * and in refusing to exclude such testimony, upon motion of defendants.” This testimony was, in substance, that one Mangum met witness Jim Witherspoon on the 22d day of December, 1890, at Pilot Point; introduced himself, and stated that Stiff had sent him from McKinney to tell them that they (the Witherspoons) could not take the cattle without paying the $13,000 mortgage claimed by the McKinney bank; also, that said Mangum came to R. M. Sloan on that day, but prior thereto, at Sloan’s camp, and asked for Witherspoon; that he said he had come from McKinney and had a message from Captain Stiff for Wither-spoon, stating that Witherspoon could not take the cattle, as he would hot lift the mortgage; also, that on the 23d day of April, 1890, said Man-gum met Chris Brooks at the pasture, and endeavored to drive seventy-five or eighty head of the cattle from the Denton County pasture through the gate into the Collin County pasture, which attempt was prevented by witness; that said Mangum claimed to represent Stiff in finding out whether the cattle were attached. One of the objections to this testimony was, that there was no proof of the agency or authority of said Mangum in making such statements or doing such acts, save his own declarations, which were insufficient to prove agency. The purpose of this testimony seems to have been to show a collusion between the McKinney bank and Stiff; and that Stiff, instead of complying with his contract in good faith, was endeavoring to use the mortgage of the McKinney bank as an obstruction to the fulfillment of his engagement. It will be seen, therefore, that the testimony was of a material character. That the acts and declarations of the agent are inadmissible to establish agency is elementary. It is not required, however, that the proof of agency be full and satisfactory before such acts and declarations are admissible. If competent evidence has first been introduced tending to prove the agency, the acts and declarations of the agent, if otherwise competent, may be admitted, as it is the province of the jury to pass upon the sufficiency of the proof .upon this as well as other issues of fact. Mech. on Ag., sec. 106. No complaint is made of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, nor of the failure of the court to instruct the jury to disregard these acts and declarations in case the authority to make them was not •otherwise shown. The only question then for us to pass upon is, did the evidence tend to show that Stiff sent Mangum with a message to Witherspoon ? The circumstances seemed to demand of him that he should at least send a representative to meet Witherspoon at Pilot Point on that day, as he failed to return himself, according to promise made on the previous day. He admits that he did send Mangum, but denies that it was for this purpose. In other respects his testimony was contradicted by some of the witnesses. The circumstances.tended to show, if appellee’s witnesses were credible, that it was more reasonable and probable that Mangum was sent with a message to Witherspoon oh that day than to carry money to a ranchman, as claimed by Stiff. The judge trying the case, with the witnesses before him, concluded that there was evidence tending to support appellee’s theory on this point; and we are not prepared to hold that in this there was error. As the testimony of Mangum, though a nonresident, was not produced, and no attempt was made to procure it, we have hesitated much in approving this ruling. 7. The plea in reconvention contains a traverse of the two grounds upon which the attachment was sued out. Upon the issue thus raised as to the truthfulness of the ground that the debt was due for money obtained under false pretenses, appellants requested the following charge, which was refused: “If you believe from the evidence that plaintiff J. J. Fisher advanced to defendant E. E. Stiff the sum of $1200, which money was obtained by false pretenses made by Stiff, and the remainder of the money advanced by plaintiff was not obtained in such way, then you are instructed, that the obtaining of such money in such way would not justify the charge made in the affidavit that the money sued for was obtained under false pretenses.” The evidence clearly called for this charge, if it be the law that an attachment is wrongfully sued out on this ground where only a part of the debt is due for property obtained under false pretenses. This question seems, so far as our research has gone, never to have been raised before, and must therefore be disposed-of without the benefit of precedent. It seems to us an attachment in such ■case is permitted*by the statute only to secure the debt, and none other, due for the property so obtained, and that an affidavit, for instance, which alleges that a debt of $10,000' is due for property obtained under false pretenses, where only about one-tenth of the debt is due for property obtained in that way, must be held to be not only literally but substantially false; and that a seizure of a debtor’s property to secure so large a sum is wrongful, unless upon some other ground the attachment is lawfully sued out. We are therefore constrained to hold that for this error alone the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 7, 1893. Pending a motion for rehearing, the opinion of the Supreme Court was-had upon certified question as to whether the trial court should have given the requested charge, relating to the affidavit for attachment, as set forth in the last paragraph of the foregoing opinion. Stiff v. Fisher,. 85 Texas, 556. Motion overruled.","E. R. Stiff et al. v. J. J. Fisher. No. 90. 1. Attachment—Debt and Unliquidated Damages.—The difference between the contract price of property and its market value at the time and place it should have been delivered constitutes, not a claim for unliquidated damages, but a debt such as will""support an attachment, since the demand arises out of a contract, and the measure of damages is such as plaintiff can aver by affidavit to be due; and it is not material whether the promise to pay such damages be express or implied. 2. Substituted Contract — Right of Action upon the Original Contract Remains, When. — Where a substituted contract made slight changes as to details in executing the original contract, in relation to matters not of the essence of the original contract, the court did not err in charging that such substituted contract, set up by defendant, would not prevent the plaintiff from maintaining his action upon the original contract, unless it appeared that the new-contract had in fact been performed bjr the defendant, or that he was ready, willing, and able to perform the same according to its terms. 3. Evidence of Another Contract Admissible, When.—Where, in an action for failure to deliver certain cattle, the defendant attempted to prove that he had more cattle ready to deliver than was required to lili the contract, it was competent for the plaintiff to prove in rebuttal that defendant had also obligated himself to deliver cattle at the same time and place in fulfillment of another contract with another person. 4. Market Value—Place of Delivery.—Where a contract called for the delivery of cattle at or near V., a town in C. county, it was competent to prove the market value of such cattle in C. county generally, it being shown that there was no market at V. different from the market in the county generally. 5. Attachment—Fraudulent Disposition of Property.—In an action where an attachment had issued on the ground that the defendant had disposed of his property with intent to defraud his creditors, and there was proof that the defendant had mortgaged the property, the court correctly refused an instruction containing the proposition, that if the debt secured ""by the mortgage was real and not fictitious, the giving of the mortgage was not a fraudulent disposition of the property, since such a charge would have withdrawn from the jury the consideration whether or not the mortgage was, in fact, executed with a fraudulent intent. 6. Agency — Declarations of Agent Admissible, When. —It is not required that the proof of agency be full and satisfactory before evidence of the agent's acts and declarations are admissible. If competent evidence has first been introduced tending to prove the agency, the acts and declarations of the agent, if otherwise competent, may be admitted, as it is the province of the jury to pass upon the sufficiency of the proof upon this as well as other issues of fact. 7. Attachment—Affidavit for, True only in Part.—An affidavit for attachment which alleges that the debt sued for is due for property obtained under false pretenses, where in fact only a small part of the debt is due for property obtained in that way, is both literally and substantially false, and a seizure of the debtor’s property to secure the larger sum is wrongful. Appeal from Cooke. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. T. F.Mangum and Stuart & Lewis, for appellants.—1. The court erred in overruling defendants’ motion to quash the attachment, because the -same is based upon a claim for unliquidated damages not fixed by the contract, but dependent upon contingent facts, and necessarily requiring the estimate and intervention of a jury. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., secs. 152, 153, 155, 156, 183, 184; Drake on Attach., secs. 25, 26; Jefery v. Woolley, 5 Halst., 123; Hochstadler v. Sam, 73 Texas, 315. 2. If, in lieu of the obligations o.f a pending contract, a binding promise for a new consideration, performable at a future day certain, is given, which new promise is, by intent and effect of the new agreement, itself a satisfaction and extinction of the old, then the remedy upon the original cause is wholly gone, and can not be revived by failure to perform the new agreement. This question is one of intent from all the facts. A contract is discharged by alteration of its terms, when what is to be done is so far altered as to be inconsistent with it and to amount to a new contract. Railway v. Harriett, 80 Texas, 73; 2 Pars, on Con., 682, 684, note f; Babcock v.

It was not competent nor legal to establish defendants’ incapacity to comply with the Fisher contract sued on, by establishing the existence of a like contract with Stevens. 4. In the absence of a market at the place of delivery, Valley View, the market value of the cattle there could only be shown by proof of the market price at the nearest point where property of a like character, in like quantity, could be bought and sold, with addition of the cost of transportation.

The mortgage to the First National Bank of McKinney was subordinate to Fisher’s equitable right of specific performance of the contract by delivery of the cattle, and could not be used to defeat this right. Coleman v. Dunman, 67 Texas, 390’; 3 Pome.Eq., sec. 1296; 2 Pome. Eq., .secs. 801-821. 6. The declarations or admissions of one who assumes to be agent for another are not admissible to prove such agency. Latham v. Pledger, 11 Texas, 439; Insurance Co. v. McGregor, 63 Texas, 399; Coleman v. Colgate, 69 Texas, 89; Mech. on Ag., secs. 100, 101. 7. Proof that $1200 was obtained under false pretenses would not justify the charge made in the affidavit for attachment, that the money sued for in this cause, $10,200, was obtained under false pretenses. Davis & Harris, for appellee. 1. The measure of damages depended upon the market value of the cattle, and there was no such uncertainty in regard to it as would prevent the suing out of an attachment. Hockstadler v. Sam, 73 Texas, 315; Drake on Attach., sec. 12, et seq.; 1 Wade on Attach., sec. 10, et seq.; Wilson v. Wilson, 50 Am. Dec., 685. 2. The charge of the court as to the substituted contract was all that was required by the evidence on that subject. Overton v. Conner, 50 Texas, 113; Railway v. Gordon, 70 Texas, 87; Schwartz v. Evans Co., 75 Texas, 198; 6 Wait’s Act. and Def., 413. 3. The contract with J. R. Stevens, being set forth by appellants in their answer, was admissible in evidence; and besides, it was admissible-upon the question of the ability of appellants to comply with their contract. 4. The evidence of the market value of the cattle was admissible under the circumstances of the case. Sedg. on Dam. (6 ed.), 334; 2 Suth. on Dam., 375; Cohen v. Platt, 69 N. Y., 352. 5. The charge of the court as to the law of attachments and the measure of damages was all that was demanded by the evidence, and the charges requested were incorrect and inapplicable to the facts.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On June 9, 1888, appellant received for shipment by the same train at Brandon, in Hill County, Texas, to be carried to East St. Louis, in the State of Illinois, 46 head of cattle for •one A. Roberts, 70 head of cattle for E. Roberts, 63 head of cattle for Sloan & Roberts, 48 head of cattle for D. B. Sloan, 26 head of cattle for Dyer Bros., 22 head of cattle for W. J. Turner; and at Kerens, in Navarro County, Texas, it received from J. J. Goodnight 49 head of cattle, to be carried, by the same train as those above named, from said place to East St. Louis, in the State of Illinois. At the time of receiving said cattle as aforesaid, each of said parties, with the agent of appellant, executed a separate written contract, in each of which it was stipulated that said parties agreed, that “as a condition precedent to his right to any damages for any loss or injury to his stock during the transportation thereof or previous to loading thereof for shipment, he would give notice in writing, verified by affidavit, of his claim therefor to some general officer of said first party, or to its nearest station agent, before said stock is removed from the point of shipment or from the place of destination, and before said stock are mingled with other stock, within one day after the delivery of such stock at its point of destination, and before the .same shall have been removed, etc., to the end that such claim may be fully and fairly investigated; and that a failure to fully comply with the terms of this clause shall be a complete bar to any recovery of any and all such claims.” In reaching East St. Louis, the point of destination, it was necessary for said cattle to pass over the line of a connecting carrier from Cairo, Illinois, which was the terminus of appellant’s line, and at East St. Louis appellant had no general officer or station agent within the meaning of the contract aforesaid, but from one to two miles distant therefrom, at St. Louis, in the State of Missouri, it did have its general offices and general officers within the meaning of said contract, but the evidence does not show which, if any, of these was present at the office of appellant during the day on which the notice called for in the contract was required to be given. The first feeding station after loading the cattle would have been at Texarkana, in the State of Texas; but the cattle having arrived there on time, and not having been in the cars longer than 23 or 24 hours, on the suggestion of the conductor of appellant that they would be able to reach Pine Bluff, the next feeding station, on time, appellee agreed that the cattle need not be unloaded until they reached this last named station. Between Texarkana and Pine Bluff, however, one of appellant’s trains had been derailed, preventing the passage of the train containing these cattle and causing their delay for about 8 or 9 hours, and thus kept the cattle in the cars from 41 to 45 hours without unloading, feeding, or watering. The evidence shows that after cattle have been kept in cars as much as 28 hours they damage very rapidly, causing them to become feverish, so that when they reach food and water they take too much, and that the damage thus caused is not remedied by subsequent good treatment on the journey. The damage found by the court below to have been caused by the unusual delay above set forth was estimated at $1555 upon all of the cattle, including those of Goodnight. The court also found that this damage was caused by negligence on the part of appellant; and also that the contract requiring notice to be given by appellees was not reasonable under the circumstances of this case. No notice as called for in the contract was, in fact, given of this damage. Appellee, on July 23, 1888, filed this suit to recover the damage so caused to all of the cattle above named, alleging transfers from the other owners to him of their claims for such damage, and on the trial he proved such transfers from all the parties except, Goodnight, but proved no transfer from him. In his petition he alleged the damage to be $5 per head, and on the trial recovered judgment for $1555, as above stated. Appellee tenders in this court a remittitur of $245, being $5 per head on the 49 head of Goodnight cattle, together with interest thereon at 8 per cent per annum from the date of the ""judgment, and asks that the judgment rendered below as to the remainder of such damage be affirmed. Appellant’s first assignment of error complains of the action of the court below in overruling its general demurrer to appellee’s petition. Appellant’s objection to the petition, as we gather from the propositions made under this assignment, is, that it is not sufficiently specific in stating the damage to the cattle and the difference in their market value caused by the treatment complained of therein. We are of opinion that the petition was sufficient, on general demurrer at least, and that appellant’s specific objections, as set forth in its bill of exceptions, can not be made to answer the purpose of special exceptions. Appellant’s second, third, and fourth assignments of error complain of the action of the court below in permitting appellee to introduce in evidence the written transfer from the other shippers to him of their claim against appellant for the damages caused to them, and in permitting appellee by verbal evidence to identify the claims referred to in this transfer with the ones sued on by him. The ground of the objection to this transfer was, that the appellant’s name is given in appellee’s petition as “ The St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas,” and the transfer from these several parties was of their claims for damages against “ The St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company;” appellant claiming that this constituted a fatal variance which could not be supplied by verbal evidence. Appellee in his petition did not declare upon this written transfer, but only alleged in general terms that these several parties, for a valuable consideration, had transferred their claims to him, and the instrument complained of was offered to prove this allegation; and under the allegations in plaintiff’s petition we think he was correctly allowed to introduce any evidence that would show that he was the owner of these several claims for damage against appellant, and that this evidence could either have been wholly written, wholly verbal, or partly written and partly verbal; and we do not think the objection comes within the reason of those cases relating to variances between a written instrument declared on in the pleading and the one offered in evidence. But even if these decisions should apply, we are not prepared to hold that the variance in this case could have misled appellant, and therefore be held material. Mason v. McLaughlin, 16 Texas, 24. Appellant’s fifth and seventh assignments of error complain of the action of the court in permitting appellee to introduce evidence of a slight delay to the train containing the cattle between Brandon and Corsicana, Texas, the delay complained of being alleged in the petition to have occurred between Kerens, Texas, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas, both points being east of Corsicana. Where the trial is before the court without a jury the admission of improper evidence is not ordinarily sufficient to require a reversal. Schleicher v. Markward, 61 Texas, 99; Andrews v. Key, 77 Texas, 35. In this case the court in its findings expressly states that this delay was not taken into consideration, and of course, under these circumstances, the admission of this evidence, even though error, would be no ground for reversal. Appellant’s sixth assignment of error complains of the action of the court in permitting the witness E. Roberts to testify that defendant’s track at the place where the delay occurred was in bad condition, the ground of objection to this evidence being that there was no allegation of bad track in appellee’s petition. There was, however, an allegation that the delay to these cattle was caused by the negligence of appellant, and we think this evidence was admissible to show such negligence. At any rate it could only be classed as immaterial or irrelevant; and the trial being before the court without a jury, the admission of such evidence is not ground for reversal. Andrews v. Key, cited above. Appellant’s eighth and ninth assignments of error complain of the action of the court in admitting verbal testimony to show that the terminus of appellant’s line of railway was at Cairo, Illinois, and from there to East St. Louis, the point of destination, the cattle were carried by a connecting line. This evidence was admitted as bearing upon the reasonableness of the written contract requiring appellees to give notice of their damage at the place of destination, and was admitted, in connection with other evidence, to show that appellant had no agent at the point of destination to whom the notice called for in the contract could be given. For this purpose we think the evidence was admissible. Appellant’s objection to this evidence was, that there was no allegation in appellee’s petition that appellant did not own and operate a through line to East St. Louis. Appellee did allege that appellant had no station agent nor general officer at the point of destination to whom the notice could be given. The burden, however, was upon appellant to allege and prove the reasonableness of its contract as applied to the facts of this particular case, and this evidence was properly admitted to rebut the issue upon this question. During the transit of the cattle between Pine Bluff and Cairo, A. Roberts and E. Roberts, who were with the cattle attending to them for the shippers, signed written statements at Jonesboro and Bird’s Point to the effect that the cattle were then in good condition, and in its tenth and eleventh assignments of error appellant complains of the action of the court in permitting verbal evidence, especially from these witnesses, to supplant, contradict, and vary these written instruments. That such instruments are not to be classed as conclusive admissions, or as constituting an estoppel, we think clear. Mr. Wharton, in his work on the Law of Evidence, volume 2, section 1077, says: “ Supposing an admission is set up, not as the basis of a contract, but simply as the concession of a fact on which the opposite party relies to make his case, then the admission, as we have already seen, is not a probatio, but a levamen probationis; it does not prove a fact, in the strict sense, when offered against the declarant, but it relieves the party relying on it from proving such fact, thereby throwing the burden of disproving on the declarant. By the scholastic jurists such admissions were spoken of sometimes as half-proofs, sometimes as presumptions. With us, evidence that they were made may be admissible, either as yielding presumptions against the party charged, or as relieving (under ordinary circumstances) the party offering them from the necessity of more formal proof. At the same time it must be remembered that they are not conclusive proof of what they state; that they may be readily neutralized by proof that they were uttered in ignorance or levity or mistake; and hence that they are, at the best, to be regarded as only cumulative proof, which affords but a precarious support, and on which no party should be content to rest his case. * * * In fine, where the party seeking to prove admissions in no way altered his status in consequence of their utterance, the party making them can always prove their untruth, though not, it is said, by introducing subsequent inconsistent declarations.” Also see Irvin v. Ellis, 76 Texas, 165. Appellant’s twelfth assignment complains that the judgment of the court is not supported by the evidence, first, because appellee and his assignors consented that the cattle need not be watered and fed at Texarkana, and are thereby estopped from claiming negligence on the part of the defendant for not feeding and watering them. We think this would be a correct statement of the law if the only delay was such as resulted in the extra time required to make the next feeding station, in the absence of negligence on the part of appellant, but it would have no application to an unusual delay caused by its negligence in not making the customary time. Appellant in the same assignment complains that the amount of damage allowed by the court is excessive. While the amount to us seems large, yet several witnesses were permitted without objection to estimate the amount of damage caused to the cattle by the unusual delay at from $3 to $5 per head. The witness Smith was disinterested, and testified as an expert that the damage caused by this delay was at least $5 per head. Appellant had several experts upon the stand, and none of them were asked to estimate the amount of this damage. The amount allowed by the court did not reach the full limit justified by the opinions of some of the witnesses, and under the circumstances we would not be authorized to disturb the finding of the lower court when the remittitur is entered, as will hereafter be done. In its twelfth assignment appellant also complains that the finding of the court below that the contract requiring notice was unreasonable and void can not be sustained by the evidence. As stated above, and as we have several times decided, in such cases the burden is upon the carrier, both by pleading and evidence, to establish the reasonableness of a contract of this kind as applied to the facts of the particular case. In this case it seems that the line of. appellant’s road terminated at Cairo, and it' had no officer or agent at East St. Louis, the point of destination, but it did have such officer at St. Louis, in the State of Missouri. It is not shown, either by pleading or evidence, the name of any of these officers who were in St. Louis at the time this notice was required to be given by the contract. It appears that at the time this notice should have been given the shipper’s agents in charge of the stock were not acquainted with such officers and did not know where to find them; and to have found them it would have been necessary for such agents to have crossed the Mississippi River into an adjoining State, and to have assumed the responsibility of finding and deciding as to which one of these officers was a general officer within the meaning of the contract; and under the circumstances we are not prepared to say that the court erred in concluding that the contract was unreasonable in this case. If the carrier desires to claim exemption from damages caused by it, by reason of the failure of the shipper to give notice in compliance with one of these contracts, it must furnish reasonable facilities for such notice to be given in compliance therewith; and we are not prepared to say that it would be reasonable to require a shipper to leave his stock and go to a station in another State in search of some one upon whom to serve such notice. Delivered December 20, 1892. Appellant also in its twelfth assignment complains that the judgment of the court can not be sustained by the evidence, because it claims that the written statements certifying that the cattle at the different places in transit were in good condition, caused it to forego making an examination into the condition of same upon their arrival at their point of destination, and was in effect a notice in writing that the stock shipped"" had been shipped in good condition, but we find nothing in the evidence to sustain the assumption that these statements had anjr such effect. We do not hold that an estoppel of this kind could not be successfully interposed if it were sustained by allegation and evidence, but we would not be authorized to assume, in -the absence of evidence, that these statements had any such effect in this case. As stated above, appellee has filed in this court a remittitur of $5 per head for each head Of the Goodnight cattle, with interest on said amount from the date of the judgment. As this is the amount of damage per head claimed in his petition, and as the court could not have allowed any greater sum than this as the damage to said cattle, we are of opinion that this remittitur should be allowed, and that the judgment below should be reformed to correspond therewith. Railway v. Measles, 81 Texas, 474. Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment rendered by the court below should be reformed by entering the remittitur as above indicated, and when so reformed it should be in all other respects affirmed, and it is so ordered.. Reformed and affirmed. Chief Justice Tarlton did not sit in this case.","The Saint Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas v. W. J. Turner. No. 54. 1. Practice — Special Exceptions. — Where a petition is good on general demurrer, specific objections set forth in a bill of exceptions can not, on appeal, be made to answer the purpose of special exceptions not urged to the petition below. 2. Pleading and Proof — Variance in Name. —A petition against “The St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas” alleged the transfer to plaintiff of certain claims for damages against the defendant, and the proof offered was of certain written transfers of such claims against “The St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company.” Held, that the variance could not have misled; and also, that as the transfers were not declared on in the petition, the variance could be supplied by parol evidence. 3. Practice — Erroneous Evidence not Cause for Reversal, when. In a trial before the court, the admission of improper evidence will not require a reversal where it clearly appears from the findings that it did not influence the judgment; or, being immaterial or irrelevant, could not reasonably have done so. 4. Pleadings — Allegations and Proof. — In a suit for damages resulting from delay in the shipment of cattle, the petition alleged that the delay was caused by the negligence of the defendant railway company; and this was held sufficient to admit evidence that the defendant’s track was in bad condition at the place where the delay occurred. 5. Same — Notice of Claim for Damages. — Where a written contract of shipment required notice of a claim for damages to be given at the place of destination, defendant was properly allowed to show by verbal testimony that defendant’s line of railway ended at an intermediate point, and that from there to the point of destination the cattle were carried by a connecting line. 6. Evidence — Written Admission not Conclusive. — Written statements of the good condition of the cattle, given to the railway company by the shipper’s agents in charge of them during the transit, while adding to his burden of proving their bad condition, may yet be contradicted by him by showing that they are not true. 7. Same — Admission as Estoppel. — A claim that such written statements estop the shipper by reason of their causing the railway company to forego making an examination into the condition of the cattle at the point of destination, is not good where there is nothing in the evidence to sustain the assumption that the statements had such effect. 8. Notice of Claim for Damages— Burden of Proving Reasonableness. — Where a cattle shipping contract requires notice to be given of a claim for damages within a very limited time, the burden of showing by pleading and evidence that such stipulation is reasonable under the fact of the particular case, is upon the railway company. 9. Judgment for Damages not Excessive, when. — Where the amount of damages allowed by the court does not reach the full limit justified by the opinions of some of the expert witnesses, the appellate court will not disturb the finding of the lower court on the ground that the judgment is excessive. 10. Remitter of Damages. — See the opinion for case in which a remitter of part of the damages allowed on a shipment of cattle was entered in the appellate court and the judgment reformed and affirmed accordingly. Appeal from Hill. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. Clark, Dyer & Bolinger and T. H. Dixon, for appellant. 1. Plaintiff’s petition contains no sufficient allegations to justify the admission of evidence in support of the matters complained of, and fails to specify the market value of the cattle when they were delivered, or when, under the averments, they should have been delivered. 2 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 850, note 4. 2. The court erred in admitting in evidence the purported contract of assignment to plaintiff of damages alleged to have been sustained by the several shippers whose names appear thereto. There was no averment in the petition that the defendant company was the company referred to in the instrument offered. Mims v. Mitchell, 1 Texas, 443; Denison v. League, 16 Texas, 407; Brown v. Martin, 19 Texas, 343; Stewart v. Gordon, 65 Texas, 344; Sayles’ Civ. Stats., 400, note 7. 3. The court erred in permitting E. Roberts, a witness for plaintiff, to testify about the condition of defendant’s track at any point on its line. As there was no allegation whatever in plaintiff’s petition or pleading as to the condition of defendant’s track at the time of the shipment of the cattle referred to, there was no foundation in the pleadings for said evidence. Guess v. Lubbock, 5 Texas, 535; Gillies v. Wofford, 26 Texas, 76; Lemmon v. Hanley 28 Texas, 219; Wheeler v. Wheeler, 65 Texas, 573. 4. The witness A. Roberts, through whom the plaintiff partly claims, and also E. Roberts, having signed written statements as to the condition of the cattle, duly certified, and delivered the same to defendant after the alleged injury, should not be permitted, over objection of defendant, to explain away and vary by parol testimony the contents of said statements when there is no ambiguity in- same. Hunt v. White, 24 Texas, 643; Lanx v. Glass, 1 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 1180. 5. The evidence does not sustain the finding of the court as to the amount of the damages allowed. Zapp v. Michaelis, 58 Texas, 270;, Newcomb v. Babb, 2 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 761. 6. The judgment is contrary to and not supported by the evidence,, because the written statements certifying that the cattle, at various points in transit, were in good condition, had the effect with defendant at the destination of said cattle shipment to cause the defendant company to forego examination of the condition of said cattle, and was in effect a notice in writing that the stock shipped had been shipped in good condition. Pome. Eq. Jur., sec. 805, et seq.; Edwards v. Dickson, 66 Texas, 613; Railway v. Gorman, 2 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 777. McKinnon & Cariton, for appellee. 1. Under a general averment of damages all the injuries arising directly from the acts complained of can be proved. Railway v. Durrett, 57 Texas, 53; So Relle v. Tel. Co., 55 Texas, 311. 2. The contract of assignment of the claims was not offered in evidence as a contract giving rise to the cause of action. The cause of action was damages on account of injuries done to the property of various parties, and the contract was an assignment to one by the others of their claims for damages; therefore the rule that there must be no variance between allegata and probata does not apply. Again, a variance, to be fatal, must be such as to surprise or mislead the opposite party. Eakin v. Ins. Co., 1 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 1234; Pleasants v. Dunkin, 47 Texas, 343; Mason v. McLaughlin, 16 Texas, 24; Mason v. Kleberg, 4 Texas, 85; Wiebusch v. Taylor, 64 Texas, 53; Shipman v. Fulcrod, 42 Texas, 248. 3. Either written or parol evidence or both were admissible to show that the various parties had assigned to appellee their claims for damages against appellant. Railway v.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This is an agreed case, and is submitted under the following statement and agreement of facts and issues: “ Nature and Result of Suit.—Suit by Wright and Bland against Bonner and Eddy, to recover of them, in their official capacity as receivers, damages alleged to have resulted from unreasonable delay in receiving at Pearsall, for shipment to Chicago, 298 head of beef cattle, and from rough, negligent, and improper handling and carriage of same en route. “Trial before the court, resulting in a judgment for plaintiffs for §945.15. “ Agreed Facts.—1. May 26, 1890, Wright, one of the plaintiffs, verbally applied to Train Master Hume, at San Antonio, for twelve or thirteen cars, to be in readiness at Pearsall Station on the morning or the evening of May 28, 1890, to take out, on the morning of May 29, 1890, 298 head of beef cattle, belonging to plaintiffs, and destined for Chicago, Illinois, for sale on that market; and Hume promised to try to get the cars, and to wire the agent at Pearsall by the morning or afternoon of May 27, whether he could have them or not. “ 2. Wright saw the agent at Pearsall and asked him if he had heard from Mr. Hume about any cars for him, and he answered, ‘ Yes,’ and that the cars would be at Pearsall to take out plaintiffs’ cattle on the next evening, May 28. He told the agent he wanted to know, as he did not wish to bring in the cattle unless they could be loaded out without delay the next morning, May 29. The agent stated to him that the cars would be at the station ready for him on the afternoon of the 28th, and that he could bring his cattle in and they would be loaded and shipped out early in the morning, about 9 or 10 o’clock, May 29. The cars arrived at Pearsall Station on the evening of May 28 to take out plaintiffs’ cattle the following morning, May 29, by 9 or 10 o’clock, and these cars were pointed out to Wright by the agent as the cars intended for the carriage of plaintiffs’ cattle. 11 3. Plaintiffs’ cattle were brought to the station and put by them into the big stock pen of the railway company, May 28, about 6 o’clock p. m. “ 4. The cattle, when put in the pen, had not been inspected and could not be shipped until inspected. “5. Early the next.morning the inspection began; but, after the inspection of about three or four car loads—about one-fourth of the cattle— one Jennings, another shipper, with about 300 cattle already inspected and ready for shipment, arrived at the station and demanded cars for their transportation. “6. The agent, over the protest and objection of Wright, shipped Jennings’ cattle in the cars at the station which had been pointed out to him as the cars intended for plaintiffs’ cattle, and plaintiffs’ cattle were delayed' and held in the small pens contiguous to the large pen, into which they had been turned after the arrival of Jennings’ cattle, and while the same were being loaded into the cars, until about 6 o’clock in the evening of May 29. These pens were crowded and muddy, and the cattle were without food or water during the eight or nine hours delay occasioned by the refusal of the agent to permit the plaintiffs to have the cars which' were given to Jennings. 11 7. After the arrival of Jennings’ cattle, the inspection of plaintiffs’' cattle was suspended until after Jennings’ cattle were loaded, which consumed about two and a half hours. "" “ 8. Had the inspection of plaintiffs’ cattle been proceeded with, and not suspended upon the arrival of Jennings’ cattle, the inspection could' have been completed and plaintiffs’ cattle loaded into the cars by 9 or 10 o’clock; and when the Jennings cattle arrived enough of plaintiffs’' cattle had been inspected to begin loading, and the balance of the cattle could have been inspected as fast as they could have been loaded, and the inspection and loading could have been carried on simultaneously without interruption to either, and both have been completed between 9’ and 10 o’clock in the morning. It usually took from ten to fifteen minutes to inspect and load a carload of cattle. It was the custom at the stock pens at' Pearsall, and along the entire line of the International & Great Northern Railway, to use the pens of the railway company for inspecting the cattle, and the practice was, when enough cattle had been inspected, to commence loading, and then to carry on the inspection and loading simultaneously. Plaintiffs’ cattle were in only two brands. “9. The cattle sustained injury while delayed at Pearsall, and also* while en route to point of destination. “ No question is made as to the character or extent of the injuries sustained by the cattle, nor of the amount of the judgment, if under the agreed facts the defendants are liable. “ The question presented for the determination of the courtis, whether, under the agreed facts, the defendants were justified in giving to the Jennings cattle preference of shipment in the cars originally intended for plaintiffs’ cattle, and relieved from the consequences of the delay. “ The appellants claim that the action of the agent in giving preference to the Jennings shipment was justified, and constituted a complete defense to its action for all injuries resulting from delay. Appellees, on the other hand, contend that the action of the agent was not justified and constituted no defense.” The railway company has appealed, and in support of its general proposition, that under the agreed facts it is not liable for the delay in shipping plaintiffs’ cattle, and in giving preference to the Jennings shipment, cites article 784 of the Criminal Code and articles 4628, 4630, 4651, and 4251 of the Revised Statutes. The article of the Criminal Code cited makes it a misdemeanor for any agent of a railway to receive for shipment any cattle unless they have been duly inspected according to law. Article 4628 of the Revised Statutes requires the purchaser of cattle for shipment out of the county or for slaughter to procure a bill of sale from the owner, particularly describing the cattle. Article 4630 provides, that when an inspector shall have inspected any animal or animals, he shall, on the presentation of a bill of sale or power of attorney from the owner or owners, duly signed and acknowledged, and on payment of his fees, deliver to the purchasers a certificate of inspection, which certificate shall not be complete until it and the bill of sale shall have been recorded in office of the county clerk and certified to by him under his hand and seal. It is then provided, that the certificate shall be delivered to the purchaser, and that it shall protect him from the payment of inspection fees for the same animals in any other district. Article 4651 provides, that the inspector shall not make out certificate of inspection (which he is to record in his record) until he has examined the bills of sale and is satisfied that the person claiming the cattle has correct bills of sale or chain of transfer from the recorded owner, or is the owner himself, etc. We do not think the plaintiffs were required to have all the foregoing acts of the Legislature complied with before they could deliver their cattle to defendants’ agent for shipment, or that the agent would be an offender under the code by receiving the cattle before such full compliance. After the cattle were in fact inspected, he would be authorized to receive them. It is agreed, that if the inspection had been proceeded with and not suspended upon the arrival of Jennings’ cattle, the inspection could have been completed and plaintiffs’ cattle loaded into the cars by 9 or 10 o’clock, the time, according to the contract, when they were to be loaded; and it was the custom to carry on the loading and inspection at the same-time, when enough cattle had been inspected to commence loading. We can not see how the inspection of the cattle, by the terms of the agreed facts, caused any delay. There would have been no breach of the contract or delay, if the agent had not stopped the delivery of plaintiffs’ cattle to receive Jennings’. A part of plaintiffs’ cattle were ready to be loaded, and they could have been inspected as fast as they were loaded. The fact that Jennings presented cattle for shipment could not affect the right of plaintiffs under their contract. Defendants were bound by the contract with plaintiffs, whatever may have been their obligations to Jennings. If the agent used the cars intended for plaintiffs’ cattle, they would still be bound on the contract with plaintiffs. Cross and Eddy v. McFaden & Logan, 1 Texas Civ. App., 461. Under the facts and issues as presented, we are of opinion that defendants were liable for the delay, and were not relieved therefrom by the necessity, if it existed, to ship the Jennings cattle. Appellants say, however, that the judgment can not stand, because the agreed facts fail to show how much of the judgment was for damages for delay, how much for injuries en route, and how much, if any, from other causes. This objection to the judgment is answered by the ninth clause of the agreement, to-wit: “ 9. The cattle sustained injury while delayed at Pearsall, and also while en route to point of destination. “No question is made as to the character or extent of the injuries sustained by the cattle, nor of the amount of the judgment, if under the agreed facts the defendants are liable.” We have decided the only question we are authorized to consider under the agreed case, and are of opinion that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed. Delivered January 11, 1893.","THIRD DISTRICT, JANUARY, 1893. Receivers of International & Great Northern Railway Company v. W. C. Wright and H. Bland. No. 737. 1. Inspection oí Cattle Before Shipment. — It is not required of a shipper of cattle to have his entire herd inspected under the inspection laws before the delivery of such cattle to the railway agent for shipment; nor would the agent be an offender from receiving a herd of cattle for shipment before the full compliance with the inspection laws. This ruling is made where a part of the herd had been inspected, and the remainder could have been inspected without causing any delay in loading them into the cars for shipment. 9. Shipment of Cattle.—Owners of cattle contracted for cars for the shipment of their cattle. The cars were furnished and pointed out. Before any cattle were placed upon the cars, and when a part only of the cattle had been inspected, another herd of which inspection was completed was tendered. The inspection of the first herd could have proceeded to completion so as to cause no delay in the shipment. Held, that the railway company was liable to the owners of the first herd for damages for the delay caused by the preferred acceptance of the second herd for shipment. The tender of the second herd could not excuse the violation of the contract with the owners of the first herd. Appeal from the County Court of Williamson. Tried below before Hon. D. S. Chesher. Fisher & Townes, for appellants. 1. Under the agreed facts, appellants’ delay in shipping out of Pearsall and in delivering appellees’ cattle at Chicago was excused, and they were relieved from all liability for damages resulting therefrom. Grim. Code, art. 784; Rev. Stats., arts. 4628, 4630, 4651, 4251. 2. Appellees’ cattle had not been inspected, and were not in condition to be received for shipment, when Jennings’ cattle, which had been inspected and were ready for shipment, were tendered; and the appellants, as common carriers, could not rightfully or legally discriminate against Jennings by delaying his shipment until appellees should get their cattle in readiness for shipment by complying with the law as to inspection. Grim. Code, art. 784; Rev. Stats., arts. 279, 4628, 4630, 4651. J. W. Parker, for appellees. The vice in appellants’ entire contention lies in assuming that appellees’ cattle were not ready to be loaded when the Jennings cattle were tendered, when the facts show that a portion were ready to be loaded, and that the balance could have been inspected as fast as they could have been loaded, and that the method of inspecting and loading appellees’ cattle was in strict accord with the usage obtaining at those pens; and in assuming that the Jennings cattle would have been delayed in shipping out had appellants allowed the inspection of appellees’ cattle to proceed. The fact is, the act of the agent in turning appellees’ cars over to Jennings was an unjust and unlawful discrimination against appellees, and rendered appellants liable for the delay thus occasioned and the consequent damages.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. This case was tried before the court without a jury, and the facts are correctly set forth in the special findings filed in the court below, as follows: The Board of Land Commissioners of Shelby County issued certificate No. 472 to H. Corzine as assignee of John Ransom, for one league and labor of land, dated May 19, 1838, and transferred on May 23, 1838, to F. M. Weatherred by said Corzine, by written transfer upon the back .thereof. This certificate was cancelled by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on April 23, 1853. Certificate No. 2817-2918, for one league and labor of land, was issued to F. M. Weatherred as assignee of H. Corzine, in accordance with an act of the Legislature of Texas, approved February 7, 1853, granting to H. Corzine, his heirs or assigns, a league and labor of land; said special act of the Legislature providing that no certificate should issue if a certificate for a like quantity of land had been previously issued. On July 3, 1854, certificate No. 3561-3662 (for unlocated balance of said certificate No. 2817-2918) for 17,553,925 square varas of land, was issued to Francis M. Weatherred, assignee of H. Corzine, said certificate being that by virtue of which the land in controversy was located. The land in controversy was patented to W. R D. Ward, assignee of H. Cor-zine, May 10, 1855. H. Corzine was a married man, and died without issue in June, 1840-Ilis father was dead at the time of taking Elizabeth White’s deposition, August 8, 1888, but there is no proof as to the date of his father’s death. Ilis mother died in 1869. H. Corzine’s wife was dead August 8, 1888,. but the date of her death is not shown by the evidence. His only brother is S. S. Corzine, and his sisters were N. A. Lockhart, Elizabeth White,. S. J. Saulsbury. and Mary Green. Intervenor Elizabeth White was married to Thomas A. White in March, 1854, and he died in 1884. N. A. and L. G. Lockhart were married in 1846, since which time N. A. Lock-hart has been a married woman. W. E. D. Ward, the patentee of the land in controversy, died in 1868. Virgil Ward, the father of plaintiff, was one of the children of W. E. D. .Ward, who had five children in all. Virgil Ward died September 21, 1864. Virgil Ward had one child, the plaintiff in this suit, who was born September 29, 1864. Administration was opened on the estate of W. E. D. Ward in Harrison County, in 1868, and A. G. Ward and A. G. Turney were duly appointed administrators of his estate, and were duly qualified as such. Upon the application of A. G. Ward, one of the administrators, the Probate Court of Harrison County, at its January Term, 1877, appointed commissioners to partition the lands belonging to W. E. D. Ward’s estate, who reported to the following March Term of said court that the land in controversy, together with other lands of said estate, was not susceptible of partition, and the court thereupon ordered a sale of the same. The land in controversy was sold by the administrator to T. C. Haggart, as guardian of the person and estate of plaintiff, and the sale reported to the court, and the court duly approved said sale at the May Term, 1877. The said administrators executed and delivered the original deed to T. C. Haggart, as guardian of plaintiff’s estate, to the land in controversy, introduced in evidence, in pursuance of said order of court. A part of the purchase price for said land was paid in cash out of the estate of plaintiff, and T. C. Haggart, describing himself as guardian of the person and estate of said minor, executed a note for the balance of the purchase money, payable to said administrators, who brought suit upon said note, and to foreclose the vendor’s lien, in the District Court of Archer County, in October, 1881, joining with said I-Iaggart the plaintiff herein as defendant therein. In that suit Haggart answered as guardian of plaintiff, December. 12, 1881. Plaintiff did not answer, and the judgment introduced in evidence was rendered April 17, 1882. This judgment was for $395.35, and foreclosed the vendor’s lien on all the land in controversy. Sale was made under the order of sale issued upon said judgment introduced in evidence, on the-day of June, 1882, to Perry Webster, for the sum of $427.42. At the date of the institution of said suit the plaintiff herein was a minor, and guardianship was pending on his estate in the Probate Court of Galveston County, and Fannie A. Haggart was the guardian of his person and estate, duly appointed by said court, and T. C. Haggart was not then, and was not at any time, the guardian of the person or estate of plaintiff. T. C. Haggart had been the husband of Fannie A. Haggart, but had been divorced before the institution of said suit. The land in controversy at the date of sale was worth $6000. ■ Perry Webster and Anna Webster transferred the land in controversy to John H. Stone for $3109.50, with covenant of warranty of title only as to Perry Webster, by deed dated July 22, 1882. John H. Stone transferred the land in controversy to the Wichita Land and Cattle Company by deed dated August 14, 1882. Defendant Wichita Land and Cattle Company went into possession of the land in controversy in August, 1882, and has remained in possession, using and occupying the same, ever since. The amount of the lien on the land in controversy paid off and discharged by Perry Webster at the date of his purchase at sheriff’s sale is $427.42, which, with interest to date, amounts to the sum of $658.14, and the value of the use and occupancy by the defendant Of the land in controversy since two years before the institution of suit is $658.14. Defendant claims title to the land in controversy under administrators’ deed of A. G. Ward and A. G. Turney, and under sheriff’s deed introduced in evidence. The intervenors, N. A. Lockhart and Elizabeth White, claim as heirs of Herschel Corzine. It will be seen from the conclusions of fact that the certificate was issued to F. M. Weatherred as assignee of Corzine, on the 23d of April, 1853, thereby placing the legal title thereto in him. The ¡latent to the land in controversy was issued to Ward, assignee of Corzine, on May 10, 1855, thereby placing the legal title to this particular tract of land in Ward on that date. Looking to the face of the papers alone, it is therefore plain that the claim of these intervenors was a stale demand long before the filing of their plea of intervention. Wimberly v. Pabst, 55 Texas, 591; League v. Rogan, 59 Texas, 427; Montgomery v. Noyes, 73 Texas, 204. The intervenors, however, undertake to excuse this long delay in the assertion of their equitable claim, by showing that Mrs. Lockhart has been a feme covert since 1846, and that Mrs. White was a feme covert from March, 1854, to 1884, and that they were ignorant of this land being claimed by any one as the assignee of Cor-zine; also, that Archer County, where the land was situated, was a wild, uninhabited region, and that from 1874 to 1879 it was not attached to any county for judicial purposes, and there was no place where suit could be brought; and no actual possession adverse to intervenors’ was had until 1883. Intervenors filed their plea of intervention on the 29th of August, 1887, and their cause of action appearing on its face to be stale, the burden was upon them to allege and prove the facts that would excuse the delay. Hillebrant v. Brewer, 6 Texas, 51. In this case it is made to appear that Corzine’s mother did not die until 1869, and the only evidence as to the date of his father’s death is that he was dead on the 8th of August, 1888. It is therefore not shown that both of his parents were not living at the date of the issuance of the patent to Ward as assignee in 1855; and inasmuch as intervenors were only sisters of Corzine, they inherited nothing from him, and only became entitled to an interest in the land upon the death of one of their parents. Whether the inheritance from Corzine be governed by the law of 1840, in force at the time of his death, or by that of 1848, in force at the time the certificate was granted, brothers and sisters inherited nothing if both parents were living. It will therefore be seen that the cause of action accrued to the parents of Corzine during their lifetime; and in analogy to the statute of limitation, which prohibits the tacking of disabilities, and continues to run after it has once commenced, notwithstanding intervening disabilities, we are of opinion that upon their death laches did not cease to be imputed to intervenors by reason of their coverture, and that therefore the claims of both of them should be considered stale demands, even if we exclude from our consideration the time during which the statute of limitation was suspended by law, and also the time intervening between 1874 and 1879, during which it is alleged that Archer County was not attached to any other county for judicial purposes. McDonald v. McGuire, 8 Texas, 365; White v. Latimer, 12 Texas, 61; Hunton v. Nichols, 55 Texas, 230. It will therefore be unnecessary for us to consider the question as to whether or not the special act certificate was properly issued to Weatherred as assignee of Cor-zine under the act of 1853. From an inspection of the pleadings in this case it will be seen that the principal object of this suit is to annul a judgment rendered in the District Court of Archer County at its April Term, 1882, in favor of A. G. Ward and A. G-. Turney, administrators of W. R. D. Ward, deceased, against T. C. Haggart and appellee Y. S. J. Ward, for the sum of $395.35, and foreclosing the vendor’s lien upon the land in controversy. The grounds relied upon by appellee for annulling this judgment are, in effect, that it was obtained by fraud; that at the time of its rendition appellee was a minor only about 17 years of age, and no guardian ad litem was appointed by the court to represent his interests; that Thos. C. Haggart, though sued as his guardian, was not in fact then and has never been such guardian; that at the sale under this judgment the sum realized was a grossly inadequate consideration for the land. Appellee asks that for these reasons the judgment be declared absolutely null and void; but in the alternative prays that it, with the sale thereunder, be set aside, and offers to account for the amount paid by the purchaser at said sale. In this suit T. C. Haggart is not made a party, and the first assignment of error by appellant complains of the action of the court in overruling its special exception to appellee’s petition for this omission, and we have had great difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory conclusion as to whether or not Haggart is-a necessary party in the suit to vacate the judgment rendered against him as above set forth. It is not to be denied that in a suit to review or annul a judgment all of the parties to such judgment, or their privies, are necessary parties. York v. Cartwright, 42 Texas, 136; Williams v. Nolan, 58 Texas, 712; Slaughter v. Owens, 60 Texas, 671. In a case, however, where the owner of a judgment has assigned or transferred it he ceases to be a necessary party, and his assignee must be sued in his stead (Hudson v. Morriss, 55 Texas, 604); and in case one of the parties to the judgment be dead, his heirs or legal representatives are made parties in his stead. And so we think in this case, the judgment being against Haggart only in his representative capacity as guardian of the appellee V. S. J. Ward, when such minor became of age Haggart ceased to have any further interest in the judgment, and appellee was properly considered as his representative in this suit. It was appellee’s land that was sold for the payment of this judgment, and upon his arrival at majority he alone was interested in setting aside this sale, and we are therefore of opinion that the court did not err in holding that Haggart was not a necessary party. Jones v. Smith, 55 Texas, 383. Upon the trial in the court below the deed from A. G-. Ward and A. G-. Turney, administrators of W. R. D. Ward, deceased, to T. C. Haggart, guardian of the person and estate of V. S. J. Ward, was admitted in evidence over the objection of appellant, that it was not properly registered, and its execution had not been proven. Appellant had, however, previous to the trial, been required by appellee to file an abstract of its title under our statute, and in this abstract it had given this deed as one of the links in its chain of title, and had filed a certified copy of it with the papers; and this abstract and copy were admitted in evidence, also over the objection of appellant, to prove that the parties hereto claimed under this deed as a common source of title. It seems to have been held in Evans v. Foster, 79 Texas, 50, that this abstract was properly admitted for this purpose, and it will therefore be unnecessary for us to decide as to whether or not the execution of the deed was sufficiently proven to authorize its admission in the first instance. Appellant in his petition first seeks to have the judgment against him declared an absolute nullity, but he also prays, in case the,court decides it necessary for him to refund to appellant the amount paid by the purchaser at the sale thereunder, that the use of the land while in the possession of appellant be allowed as an offset against this amount, and this was the relief granted by the court. As we are of opinion that the petition of appellee showed good equitable grounds for having this judgment and sale set aside, it will not be necessary for us to pass upon the question as to whether or not the judgment against him during his minority, while guardianship was pending, without making his regular guardian a party, was void or only voidable. If he had been without a guardian, the failure to appoint a guardian ad litem would seem to be only an irregularity that would render the judgment voidable, but not void. Montgomery v. Carlton, 56 Texas, 431; McAnear v. Epperson, 54 Texas, 224. In Elston v. Jasper, 45 Texas, 409, however, it is decided that an insane person, while actually under legal subsisting guardianship, and in support of the guardian’s authority, is conclusively pz’esumed iizcapable to contract, and his deed, as against his guardian, is absolutely void. As to whether this would be so in the case of a minor under legal and subsisting guardianship, sued without making liis guardian a party, we shall not undertake to decide. Denni v. Elliott, 60 Texas, 339. But we are of opiniozi that such irregularity, coupled with the fact that no guardian ad litem was appointed to represent the interests of the minor izi the litigation as required by law, and that no answer was filed for him, and that under such judgment his land, worth §6000, was sold for §427.42, presents such aiz equitable case as authorized the court, at the suit of the minor, instituted within a reasonable time after arriving at his majority, to set aside such proceedings and restore the land to him. We think the eouz-t properly allowed the rents and profits of the land to be an offset against the amount paid by the purchaser at the sale under the judgment. Patrick v. Roach, 21 Texas, 251. We are not called upozz to decide whether or not the court, under the ciz-cumstances of this case, applied the pz’oper measure of recovery in behalf of appellant against its warrantor, Webster, no errors having been assigned to this part of the judgment. Delivered November 15, 1892. Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed.","Wichita Land and Cattle Company et al. v. V. S. J. Ward. No. 23. 1. Stale Demand — Coverture — Tacking Disabilities. — A married woman asserted by suit an equitable claim to land, and in reply to defendant's plea of laches and stale demand, pleaded her coverture. The cause of action accrued first to her ancestor in his lifetime, and by analogy to the statute of limitation which prohibits the tacking of disabilities, laches did not at his death then cease to be imputed to her because of her coverture. 2. Parties to Suit Annulling Judgment — Guardian.—There was a. judgment against II. in his representative capacity as guardian of W., foreclosing a vendor's lien on land deeded to H. as such guardian, and under this judgment the land was sold. W., after coming of age, sued the purchasers for the-land, alleging such judgment find sale to be void. Held, thatl-I. was not a necessary party to this latter suit. 3. Evidence — Deed — Common Source of Title. — A defendant is not entitled to exclude from evidence, for want of due proof of its execution, a deed offered by plaintiff, where it is shown by abstract of title filed under the statute in that suit by the defendant, and offered in evidence by the plaintiff, that such deed is also a link in defendant’s chain of title, and a common source of title of both parties. 4. Guardian’s Sale of Ward’s Land Voidable, when. — Where under a judgment in a suit against one wrongfully acting as guardian there was a sale of the minor's land for about one-fourteenth of its value, such minor was held entitled by suit within a reasonable time after attaining his majority to set aside such proceedings and recover the land from the purchaser at such sale and his vendees Appeal from Archer. Tried below before Hon. P. M. Stine. R. F. Arnold and W. W. Flood, for appellant Wichita Land and Cattle Company. 1. T. C. Haggart was a neccessary party to this suit. There can be no proper bill to review or proceeding to vacate a judgment at any term of a court subsequent to the one in which such judgment was rendered, without making all those who were parties to the judgment sought to be vacated also parties, either plaintiffs or defendants, to the suit seeking to review or vacate any such proceeding. Williams v. Nolan, 58 Texas, 708; Ship Channel Co. v. Bruly, 45 Texas, 6; Williams v. Bankhead, 19 Wall., 571; Story v. Livingston, 13 Pet., 375. 2. The judgment ordering the sale of the land was properly rendered in the former suit, jurisdiction having been acquired over T. C. Haggart, who had bound himself individually,, and not in any representative capacity, though using words merely descriptio personae; and judgment might have been rendered against him personally, rather than making it in rem, as was done. Mech. on Agency, secs. 409-411; Street v. Ins. Co., 75 Am. Dec., — and note; Houston v. Ward, 8 Texas, 124. F. E. Dycus, for appellants N. A. and L. C. Lockhart and Elizabeth White. The court erred in adjudging the claim of Mrs. Elizabeth White, intervenor, to be a stale demand. When a party labors under some disability, and the statute of limitation does not run, the defense of stale demand is not in point. Merrill v. Roberts, 64 Texas, 441; Reed v. West, 47 Texas, 248; Wimberly v. Pabst, 55 Texas, 591. G. H. Plowman and Crawford & Crawford, for appellee. 1. T. C. Haggart was not a necessary party to this suit. One -who has no interest in a judgment is not a proper or necessary party to a proceeding to vacate, or obtain other relief from, the judgment. Hudson v. Morriss, 55 Texas, 604; Jones v. Smith, 55 Texas, 383. 2. The judgment foreclosing the vendor’s lien, the order of sale, and sheriff’s sale thereunder, in the case of Turney and Ward v. Haggart and Ward, in the District Court of Archer County, are absolutely void, and the proceedings did not divest appellee of his title to the land. Messner v. Giddings, 65 Texas, 301; Emmons v. Williams, 28 Texas, 776; Rose v. Newman, 26 Texas, 131; Collins v. Miller, 64 Texas, 118. 3. The deed from Turney and Ward, administrators, was properly admitted as a common source, this being shown by appellants’ abstract of title, on file in the case. Defendants, by claiming under a certain title, affirm its validity. Glover v. Thomas, 75 Texas, 506; Garner v. Lasker, 71 Texas, 434. That defendant does not admit or allege that he claims under a common source will not deprive plaintiff of the right to make such proof. Keys v. Mason, 44 Texas, 142; Garner v. Lasker, 71 Texas, 434. 4. The court correctly held that the claim of the interveners was a stale demand. An equitable claim to land is stale after the lapse of ten years. Carlisle v. Hart, 27 Texas, 353; Montgomery v. Noyes, 73 Texas, 209."
"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. The nature and result of this suit is thus given by appellant: This suit was brought by appellant to enjoin the sale, by the sheriff of Brazoria County, of several tracts of land attached in a suit instituted in Galveston County by Harris Kempner against E. N. Wilson, which last suit resulted in judgment for Kempner and a foreclosure of the attachment, and an order for the sale of the attached property. W. H. Grafton intervened in the present suit, alleging that he wás surety for the debt upon which Kempner obtained his judgment, and that the judgment provided, that in case it was not satisfied out of the property of Wilson, levy should be made upon the property of Grafton. The defendant and the intervenor in the injunction suit pleaded general and special demurrers, and prayed a dissolution of the injunction. They also set up facts which they claimed should prevent the injunction from being perpetuated. The plaintiff moved to strike out the intervention; also filed a supplemental petition, in which he demurred generally and specially to the answer and intervention, and set up facts which, in connection with those in his original petition, he claimed entitled him to the injunction, notwithstanding the said answer and intervention. By consent, this supplemental petition was taken and treated as if it formed a part of the original petition for the purposes of the demurrers of the defendant and intervenor. The court overruled the motion to strike out the intervention, and sustained the demurrers of the defendant and intervenor. Thereupon the plaintiff, declining to amend, stood by his petitions as taken together, and judgment was rendered dismissing the suit, and for costs against the plaintiff and the sureties upon his injunction bond. From which judgment plaintiff and his sureties have appealed to this court. To this statement it is proper to add, that appellants were not in possession of the lands covered by the mortgages set out in their original and supplemental petitions, and under and by virtue of which he sues to restrain the sale of the lands by appellee Kempner. Nor does either of the mortgages give the mortgagee the benefit of the rents and profits of the land. The appellant’s demurrer to the petition of the intervenor Grafton was, in our judgment, properly overruled. The intervenor Grafton is directly interested in the result of this suit. He was a defendant in the suit of Kempner, in which judgment was rendered against Wilson, and against himself as the surety of Wilson, the judgment directing the property of the surety to be protected from sale under execution until the property of defendant Wilson was sold. Grafton then is interested in the subject matter of litigation between the appellant and the appellee, and must be affected by the judgment rendered in this suit, and he should therefore be permitted to intervene. Pome, on Rem., sec. 429. Besides their general exception, the defendant and intervenor presented several special exceptions to the original and supplemental petitions, which two petitions were by agreement, as recited in the judgment of the court, considered and treated as an amended original petition. The judgment upon the demurrers is general, and does not state which, if any, of the exceptions were overruled. We shall not, therefore, discuss the exceptions seriatim, but shall consider only the principal question presented by the record for our decision. Were the averments of the petition sufficient, if true, to entitle the plaintiff to the remedy prayed for ? This question, we think, must be answered in the affirmative. It is conceded that ordinarily when an execution or order of sale is levied upon property of a defendant in execution, that the sale can hot be enjoined by a creditor of the defendant who holds a lien upon the property levied on, which is prior to the judgment. But while this is the general rule, it is well established that the sale will be enjoined when it would place a cloud upon the creditor’s title. As to what constitutes a cloud upon title may not be definitely settled, the decisions of the courts on the subject not being in entire harmony. But the Supreme Court of this State has held, that an injunction will be granted to restrain an execution sale when the evidence on which the right of the complainant depends is not of record, nor shown in the papers through which the right depends. Mann v. Wallis, Landes & Co., 75 Texas, 614; Van Ratcliff v. Call, 72 Texas, 492; Gardner v. Douglass, 64 Texas, 76. The appellant’s claim of right in the property attached and ordered sold by the judgment in the suit of appellee against E. N. Wilson is twofold; first, by subrogation to the right of the Texas Land and Loan Company, under their deed of trust executed in 1866, by virtue of the assignment of the notes secured by said deed of trust to one Smith, for the use and benefit of appellant; and second, by a deed of trust upon the same property, executed to appellant in June, 1888, by said E. N. Wilson and his wife Ella Wilson, to secure the loan of $25,000, and interest on same. Appellant in his petition avers, that without his authority and without his knowledge, the said Smith executed on the 16th of May, 1890, what purports to be a release of the mortgage executed iff 1886 for the benefit of the Texas Land and Loan Company, and that same is of record in the office of the clerk of the county in which the lands covered by the said mortgage are situated. He avers, that at the time of the execution of the mortgage by Wilson and wife to him in June, 1888, it was expressly agreed and stipulated between him and said mortgagors that said mortgage to said Texas Land and Loan Company should continue in force and operation for his benefit until the money loaned by him, and as security for which the mortgage of June, 1888, was executed, should be paid; and that in confirmation of this agreement, when the debt due the Said Land and Loan Company was finally settled and liquidated, which was done in part with the money loaned by him on June, 1888, to Wilson and wife, the notes secured by the mortgage of 1886 were-by said Land and Loan Company assigned and transferred to petitioner. And. he denies that Smith, to whom said notes were assigned as agent, and for his benefit, was his agent for releasing said mortgage of 1886; and that if said Smith did execute said paper of 16th of May, 1890, it was without authority from petitioner, and void as to him. The petitioner further avers, that the said E. N. Wilson conveyed the. property covered by the mortgages to his wife, the said Ella, on the 14th of November, 1887, the deed therefor reciting that the consideration was $8000, the same being the separate money of the wife; that said deed was duly registered in the county in which the lands lie on the 16th of November, 1887; and that on the 23d of same month appellee attached said lands as the property of the said E. N. Wilson. The petitioner avers, that he had no knowledge of the existence of the suit of appellee H. Kempner against E. N. Wilson and the intervenor, W. H. Grafton, at the time he loaned his money and took the mortgage of June, 1888; and he denies all knowledge of the fraud in the sale and purchase of the lands between Wilson and his wife in November, 1887, charged against them by appellee and intervenor. These averments, we think, show conclusively that the rights claimed by appellant in the attached property are not evidenced in whole by title of record, but are dependent in part upon alleged facts, which must be established by evidence dehors the record; and this being so, a sale under execution would place a cloud on appellant’s title. The sale should be enjoined until the relative rights of appellants and appellee shall be determined and adjudicated by decree of the court. The judgment of the lower court, sustaining demurrers to plaintiff’s petition and dissolving the injunction and dismissing the suit, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the law as announced in this opinion. lieversed and remanded. Delivered March 2, 1893.","Holmes Ivory v. H. Kempner and W. H. Crafton. No. 95. 1. Petition for Injunction to Restrain Sale of Land, Held Good. See opinion in this case for a petition by an encumbrancer whose deed of trust antedated the attachment lien and judgment of the defendant, seeking-to restrain a sale of the property described in his deed of trust, upon the ground that such sale would be a cloud upon his title, which is held good. 2. Intervention, When Allowed. — Intervenor Grafton was defendant in the suit of ICempner v. Wilson and himself as surety, and the judgment directs the property of Wilson to be first sold. Grafton was therefore directly interested in this suit, and was properly allowed to intervene. 3. Injunction, When Granted to Prevent Cloud on Title.—Appellant’s claim of right to the property attached and ordered sold under the judgment in favor of appellee, is twofold: first, by subrogation to the right of the Texas Land and Loan Company under their deed of trust executed in 1866, by virtue of the assignment of the notes secured by said deed of trust to one Smith, for the use and benefit of appellant; and second, by a deed of trust upon the same property executed to appellant in June, 1888, by the debtors E. N. Wilson and wife, to secure a loan of $25,000 and interest. But all the evidence upon which the right of appellant depends is not of record, nor shown by the papers through which the right depends, and in such case an injunction will be granted to restrain an execution sale, upon the ground that such a sale would be a cloud upon the title of the plaintiff.

A surety against whom, together with his principal, judgment has been obtained which provides for a levy upon the property of the principal before a levy shall be made on the property of the surety, can not intervene in a suit where it is sought to enjoin the sale under such judgment of any special piece of property of the principal. Such surety can not intervene in the suit without alleging that the principal in the judgment is insolvent, and that he has not other property besides that levied on, with which the judgment could be satisfied.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. This case originated in the court of a justice of the peace, where judgment was rendered for appellee Coleman, against appellant, upon the following account: The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company and the Receivers of the International & Great Northern Railroad Company, T. R. Bonner and T. M. Campbell, To J. M. Coleman, Dr. To damages for failure to transport said J. M. Coleman from San Antonio to Paris, Texas, as per agreement, on purchase of ticket by said Coleman on May 16, 1891, and failure to furnish said Coleman with sleeping apartments as per agreement, to-wit: Exposure to rain and mud, loss of sleep, mental and physical suf- fering, and exposure.................................... §60 00 Bus fare, Temple ........................................ 50 Hotel fare, Temple....................................... 1 50 Value of one day’s time lost............................... 25 00 Telegrams.............................................. 85 Railroad fare from Temple to Paris......................... 6 95 Extra expenses for one day................................ 2 50 §97 30 The judgment was for the amount sued for, and an appeal was taken to the County Court, and was dismissed in the latter court upon motion of appellee; and a writ of certiorari was then sued out by appellant, and the case taken to the County Court, and it was again dismissed from that court, and an appeal was prosecuted to the Court of Appeals, and by that court transferred to this. While pending in the Court of Appeals, the appellee moved to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that no appeal was allowed from the County Court from a judgment rendered in a case originating in a Justice Court wherein the amount involved was less than §100. This motion was overruled, the Court of Appeals holding that it had jurisdiction to determine whether the County Court committed error or not in dismissing the case. Without committing this court to the ruling of the Court of Appeals in its construction of the law governing and regulating appeals in such cases, we adopt that construction in considering this appeal, and hold that there is no question of jurisdiction presented for our determination. The sole question for our decision is, did the County Court err in quashing the certiorari and dismissing the appellant’s case, and refusing it a trial de nova ? It has long been the settled law of this State, that the writ of certiorari will only be granted when the petition shows that the complainant has a meritorious cause of action or defense, and that injustice has been done him, and that such injustice is not due to the complainant’s inexcusable neglect. The record discloses that appellant appeared in the Justice Court, and was present by counsel at the trial. It offered no evidence in bar of the plaintiff’s suit, but asked, in case judgment be rendered for plaintiff against appellant, that it might have judgment over against the appellee the International & Great Northern Railway Company. The petition for the writ of certiorari upon its face presents a meritorious defense to the appellee’s suit, and the excuse for not making this defense upon the trial before the justice of the peace is, that prior to the trial in the Justice Court, appellant had no information of the nature and character of the plaintiff’s claim, save such as could be obtained from an inspection of plaintiff’s account filed in the Justice Court, and from that account appellant was justified in believing that the claim was based upon the refusal of its servants to permit the appellee to ride upon its road by virtue of the ticket purchased by him in San Antonio from the International & Great Northern Railway Company; and knowing that it had no agent in San Antonio for the sale of tickets, appellant had no reason to suspect, nor did it suspect, that appellee Coleman would upon the trial swear, as he did, that he purchased the ticket described in his account from an agent of appellant, and that said appellant was surprised at this testimony. This is substantially the excuse offered by appellant for not making the defense presented in its petition before the justice of the peace, and the majority of this court are of opinion that such statement does not render it excusable for failing to make defense to plaintiff’s suit before the justice of the peace, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the County Court, dismissing its suit and refusing it a trial de nova. Affirmed. Delivered March 16, 1893.","The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. J. M. Coleman et al. No. 214. Excuse for not Making Defense in Justice Court Unavailing.— A judgment in the Justice Court was appealed and dismissed. Then a certiorari was sued out. The question is, was it rightly quashed by the County Court? It is settled law, that the writ of certiorari will only be granted when the petition shows a meritorious action or defense, which the petition in this case does. But the reason given for not urging the defense below is, that appellant had no information of the nature of appellee's claim save such as could be obtained from an inspection of plaintiff's account filed in the Justice Court, and from that appellant was justified in believing that the claim was based upon the refusal of appellant to allow plaintiff to ride on its road by virtue of a ticket purchased in San Antonio; and knowing that appellant had no agent in San Antonio for sale of tickets, appellant had no reason to suspect that appellee upon the trial would swear, as he did, that he purchased the ticket described in his account from an agent of the appellant, and said testimony was a surprise to appellant.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On November 22, 1889, appellant filed-its third amended original petition in the form of an action of trespass to try title, but specially pleading the facts relied upon by it, to recover from appellee the title and possession of the right of way upon which is located the line of railway now in the possession of and operated by appellee between Sulphur Springs and Mount Pleasant, in this State. The facts set forth in appellant’s petition are, briefly, that in 1881 the Texas & St. Louis Railway Company, a corporation organized under the general laws of this State, acquired the right of way herein sued for, cleared the same off and graded a railway track thereon, but did not complete, equip, and put in good running order ten miles thereof within two years after the filing and recording of its articles of incorporation, whereby it is claimed said right of way and all that had been done thereon by said company became forfeited and subject to be appropriated by any new company that might take out a charter over the same way, without a new condemnation; and that in June, 1886, appellant took out such new charter and took possession of said right of way and the work done thereon as aforesaid, intending to build a road for itself over said line, and by reason of these facts claimed to be the owner of all the property so alleged to have been forfeited by said Texas & St. Louis Railway Company. That in January, 1887, appellee evicted appellant from said property, and completed a railway on said right of way, and has since been operating the same as its own. It does not appear from the petition that appellant ever completed and put in running order any part of its road, although it is alleged that it was prevented from doing so by appellee, and that prior to its eviction it had done considerable work in the way of completing the grading, clearing the right of way, etc. The value of said property is alleged to be $5000 per mile, and that there are forty miles of same, extending through Titus, Franklin, and Hopkins Counties. The court sustained appellee’s general demurrer to appellant’s petition, and from this judgment this appeal is prosecuted. Whatever our opinion may have been as an original proposition, it must now be received as the settled law of this State, that article 4278 of our Revised Statutes is self-executing, and that a railway incorporated under our general law which fails to comply with the provisions of said article, forfeits its corporate existence as to the unfinished part of its road, without the necessity of a judicial decree declaring such forfeiture in a direct proceeding instituted for that purpose. Bywaters v. Railway, 73 Texas, 624; Railway v. The State, 81 Texas, 572; Mayor of Houston v. Railway, 84 Texas, 590. It will be noticed, however, that it is only the forfeiture of the corporate existence of the association as to the unfinished part of its road that is declared by this article, and nothing is said therein as to the forfeiture of any property that it may have previously acquired; nor is its corporate existence as to the completed part of the road nor its right to retain and dispose of its property in any manner affected. The language of the article is: “ Such corporation shall forfeit its corporate existence and its powers shall cease as far as it relates to that portion of said road then unfinished, and shall be incapable of resumption by any subsequent act of incorporation.” It is therefore plain, that if appellant’s case depends upon its establishing a forfeiture by the Texas & St. Louis Railway Company of the valuable property rights alleged to have been acquired by it, it must do so under some provision of the law, either common or statutory, other than the article above quoted. “ Under the common law the rule was, that upon the dissolution of a corporation its real estate reverted to the grantor, its personal property to the sovereign, and all debts due from and to it became extinguished, but this rule no longer has application to stock corporations in this country. On the dissolution of a stock corporation its assets become a trust fund for the discharge of its liabilities, and the surplus belongs to the shareholders. Equity will always furnish a means by which debts due a corporation can be collected after its dissolution, for the benefit of parties interested, either creditors or shareholders.” Taylor on Priv. Corp., 2 ed., sec. 437, and authorities there cited. That this is the law in this State there can be no question. Our Revised Statutes, article 606, provide: “Upon the dissolution of any corporation already created by or under the laws of this State, unless a receiver is appointed by some court of competent authority, the president and directors or managers of the affairs of the corporation at the time of its dissolution, by whatever name they may be known in law, shall be trustees of the creditors and stockholders of such corporation, with full power to settle the affairs, collect the outstanding debts, and divide the moneys and other property among the stockholders, after paying the debts due and owing by such corporation at the time of its dissolution as far as such money and property will enable them; and for this purpose they may maintain or defend any judicial proceeding.” And in the case of Railway v. The State, 75 Texas, 378, our Supreme Court says: “Lawful dissolution of a corporation will destroy all its corporate franchises or privileges vested by the act of incorporation; but if it holds rights or privileges having the nature of property, secured by contract based on valuable consideration, these will survive the dissolution of the corporation for the benefit of those who may have right to or just claim upon its assets.” And as to this particular kind of property, it is expressly provided by our statute, that it shall not be forfeited by a forfeiture of its charter by the corporation. Article 4206 of our Revised Statutes reads: “ The right of way secured or to be secured by any railway company in this State, in the manner provided by law, shall not be so construed as to include the fee simple estate in lands, either public or private, nor shall the same be lost by the forfeiture or expiration of the charter, but shall remain subject to an extension of the charter or the grant of a new charter over the same way, without a new condemnation.” Appellant contends, that inasmuch as article 4278, cited above, provides that for a failure to comply therewith the corporation shall forfeit its corporate existence as to the unfinished part of its road, and “shall be incapable of resumption by any subsequent act of incorporation,” article 4206 should be construed as preserving the right of way for the first new company, not connected with the old, that will take possession of it. But we are of opinion that this contention is not sound, even if it be conceded (which we do not decide) that the State has the power thus to take property of this kind from one corporation and give it to another without compensation. It will be noted that article 4206 was enacted long before article 4278, and at a time when there was nothing in our law to prohibit the granting of a new charter to the company forfeiting the one under which the right of way was acquired; and we think this article was intended to preserve for the parties entitled thereto the property thus acquired, and prevent it from reverting to the original grantors, and not to transfer it to another corporation as a gratuity. It may be that by reason of the subsequent provision inserted in article 4278 the old corporation will not be able to obtain a new charter so as to utilize this right of way itself by building thereon, but it nevertheless remains its property, to be sold for the benefit of its creditors and stockholders to some company that can utilize it for the purposes for which it was acquired, and appellant shows affirmatively that it has no title thereto by failing to allege a claim under such corporation. Lewis on Em. Dom., sec. 594. At any rate, we are of opinion that article 4206 does not give this right of way and the work done thereon to a new company not connected with the old; and even though we be in error in holding that it still remains the property of the old company, notwithstanding the forfeiture of its charter for the unfinished part of its road, appellant is in no better position, for in this case it must recover upon the strength of its own title, and not upon the weakness of its adversary’s. Railway v. Doe, ex dem Visscher, 114 U. S., 340. Were it not for the provisions of our statute upon the subject, and the modification of the common law, as applied to the disposition of the property of stock corporations in this country upon their dissolution, it is quite probable that this right of way, having been acquired for a public use, would upon the forfeiture of the charter of the corporation vest in the State, to be applied by it to a similar use. Tifft v. Buffalo, 82 N. Y., 204. But we believe that the tendency of our courts of equity now is, even in the absence of a statute, to treat everything of value acquired by the corporation as a fund to be administered for the benefit of its creditors and shareholders upon its dissolution; and we think our statutory provisions leave no doubt upon the question in this State, and that the principle also extends to a right of way. Articles 4219 and 4261 of our Revised Statutes seem to recognize the right of the corporation to mortgage this class of property as its own, and authorizes the sale thereof under such mortgage; article 4262 authorizes its sale as the property of the corporation under execution for its debts; article 4206 provides, that “it shall not be lost by the forfeiture or expiration of the charter;” and article 606 provides for the distribution of the money and property of a dissolved corporation among its creditors and stockholders. We think the language of our Supreme Court in Railway v. The State, 75 Texas, 378, quoted above, is very much in point in sustaining this view, Article 4278 only forfeited the charter of the Texas & St. Louis Railway Company for the unfinished part of its road, but left it in existence as a corporation for the completed part, capable of holding and disposing of property acquired by it. 84 Texas, 590, supra. Another very serious question presented by this record is this: From appellant’s third amended original petition it appears its charter was filed in June, 1886, and at the time of filing said amendment in November, 1889, it had not “constructed, equipped, and put in good running order as much as ten miles of its proposed road,” as required by article 4278; and as this article is held to be self-executing so as to show the death and forfeiture by the Texas & St. Louis Railway for a like failure on its part, why does it not establish the death of appellant pending this suit, and require its abatement ? It is well settled, that the dissolution of a corporation pending litigation abates the suit, unless it be revived under some provision of the statute. Life Association v. Goode, 71 Texas, 90; same case on former appeal, 2 Texas Law Rev., 151; Taylor on Priv. Corp., see. 435. It will thus be seen that more than two years .had elapsed since January 1, 1887 (the extension granted by the act of 1885), before the filing of this amendment by appellant; and as the extension granted by the act of 1889 only applies to roads chartered since January 1, 1887, it would seem that there was nothing to save appellant, at the time of the trial below, from being in the deplorable condition in which it says it found the old Texas & St. Louis, unless it be the allegation that it was prevented from complying with said article by the acts of appellee. As to whether this will constitute a good answer to a forfeiture declared by a law of the State which decrees, that upon failure to comply with its provisions the corporation shall ipso facto cease to exist without a judicial ascertainment of such failure, we will not undertake to decide, as the question is not presented by the parties, and we only call attention to it in case of further litigation. In the court below appellee vouched in several parties alleged to be its warrantors, and appellant complains that the costs thus incurred are erroneously adjudged against it. All of the parties hereto treat this as being an action of trespass to try title; and if so, it would seem that these warrantors were properly made parties, and the costs of so doing correctly adjudged, judgment having gone in their favor by reason of the failure of appellant to maintain its suit, and not on account of any issue between them and appellee. Rev. Stats., art. 4788. At any rate, it is well settled that before appellant can avail itself of an error of this kind on appeal, it must call it to the attention of the court below and seek to have it there corrected, Jones v. Ford, 60 Texas, 127; Wiebusch v. Taylor, 64 Texas, 53; Bridges v. Samuelson, 73 Texas, 522; Dalton v. Rainey, 75 Texas, 516. Finding no error in the judgment rendered by the court below, let it be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 10, 1893. Justice Stephens concurs in the result, but not in all the reasons therefor given in the opinion.","The Sulphur Springs & Mount Pleasant Railway Company v. The St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas. No. 410. 1. Railway Corporation — Forfeiture of Charter for Nonconstruction of Road.—Article 4728 of the Revised Statutes, providing, that if any railway corporation shall not, within two years after its incorporation, construct and put in operation at least ten miles of its proposed road, “ such corporation shall forfeit its corporate existence, and its powers shall cease as far as it relates to that portion of said road then unfinished, and shall he incapable of resumption by any subsequent act of incorporation,” is self-executing, and failure to comply therewith forfeits the charter without any judicial declaration; but the forfeiture relates only to the unfinished portion of the road, not to the completed part thereof, nor to property previously acquired, and the right of the corporation to retain and dispose of its property is not in any manner affected by the terms of this article. 2. Same—Property Rights Upon Dissolution.—Upon the dissolution of a corporation created by or under the laws of this State, its officers become trustees for its creditors and stockholders, and its property rights and assets become a trust fund for their benefit. 3. Same—Ownership of Forfeited Right of Way.—Where a railway corporation has acquired a right of way, and has forfeited its charter under the statute by its noneonstriietion of its road thereon, such right of way does not revert to the grantors of the corporation, nor vest in the State, but constitutes an asset of the corporation, to be administered for the benefit of its creditors and shareholders upon its dissolution; and another corporation not connected with the old one has not the right to take possession of such unfinished road and hold it as its own property. 4. Trespass to Try Title — Costs Adjudged Against Plaintiff in Favor of Warrantors.—Where, in trespass to try title, the defendant properly vouches in his several warrantors, the costs of so doing are correctly adjudged against the plaintiff, in the event that judgment goes in favor of the defendants for plaintiff’s failure to maintain the suit. Error in a matter of this kind, to be available on appeal, must be first called to the attention of the court below. on rehearing. 5. Railway Corporation — Common Law Rule as to Effect of Dissolution Changed by Statute .—Under our statutes, the forfeiture of the charter of a railway corporation does not have the effect to divest, without compensation, the stockholders of their property rights in the roadbed acquired by their means; and to remove any apprehension from the minds of investors that the strict common law rule vesting in the State the right to the roadbed of the forfeited railway corporation might be the rule of decision here, was probably the principal reason for the enactment of our statutes touching this subject. 6. Same—Right of Another Corporation to Appropriate a Forfeited Roadbed.—If. upon the forfeiture of the charter of a railway corporation, its roadbed becomes the property of the State, another corporation, by simply taking out a charter calling for the terminal points of the forfeited charter, can not thereby acquire from the State the title to such roadbed. 7. Same — Pleading Possession of Roadbed to Sustain Ejectment.—Where one seeks to recover in trespass to try title a railway which extends over many miles, upon the ground of possession alone, he should go further with his allegations and proof than mere general statements which only show a possession that might not in fact extend beyond a very small part of the line.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. In the year 1869, B. J. Chambers, as agent of Nat Henderson, conveyed to Mary M. Wynne a tract of 6 acres of land in the town of Cleburne, Johnson County, the deed reciting a cash consideration of $57. At that time Mary M. Wynne was the wife of Peter W. Wynne, and they were living together as husband and wife, and that relation continued between them until about the year 1885 or 1886 (when Peter W. Wynne seems to have died), less than five years before the institution of this suit. Mary M. Wynne died in December, 1887. The deed on its face did not show that she was a married woman, nor did it show any fact which would make the land her separate property. Chambers testified on the trial that he had no distinct recollection of the transaction, but that his recollection was that Peter W. Wynne requested him to make the deed to his wife Mary M. Wynne. This deed to Mary M. Wynne was made in the summer of 1869, and in October of that year, in consideration of $1, and love and affection, she conveyed the property to her son-in-law, Benjamin F. Fox, the husband of appellant, which deed was acknowledged before her husband Peter W. Wynne, county clerk of Johnson County, and by him recorded; but he did not join her in the deed. In the spring of 1870, Benjamin F. Fox conveyed the property to Jeff Wright, in consideration of $125, which deed was likewise acknowledged before and recorded by Peter W. Wynne, and the evidence also tended to show that he wrote this deed. Thereafter appellees acquired different portions of the land under conveyances from and under Jeff Wright, for which they seem to have paid value, purchasing in good faith, without any actual knowledge of the facts which would render their titles defective. It was also admitted and proved that their possession was sufficient, in length and in character, to sustain their pleas of limitation of five and ten years, provided the statute of limitation was applicable to the facts of this case. Benjamin F. Fox, the son-in-law, seems to have abandoned his wife, and refused to join in this suit. Upon testimony sustaining these conclusions, the case was submitted to the jury, and upon their verdict in favor of appellees judgment was entered, from which this appeal is prosecuted. The first assignment of error complains that the court erred in excluding portions of the depositions of Benjamin F. Fox and his wife Ella Fox, which portions are fully set forth in the bill of exceptions; but this bill, if indeed it can properly be called a bill of exceptions, does not show that the testimony was excluded, or that any objection was made to its introduction, nor that any exception was taken to its exclusion, if excluded. It follows, under the well settled rules of practice, that this assignment can not therefore be sustained. The second assignment of error complains of the following charge: “ The court instructs you, that if you believe from the evidence that the land sued for was the community property of Mary M. Wynne and her husband Peter W. Wynne, if you find she had a husband at the time she made the deed to B. F. Fox, and that her said husband took her acknowledgment to said deed; and shall also believe from the evidence that said Fox sold and deeded said land to Jeff Wright, and that Peter W. Wynne wrote said deed and took the acknowledgment of said Fox to said deed made to Wright, then you will find for defendants.” The objection to this and other charges, on the ground, as alleged by appellant, that because both parties claimed under the deed to Mary M. Wynne as a common source of title they were erroneous, we think is not well taken. We can not perceive how the claim by appellees under this deed as a common source could be construed to be inconsistent with their claim that the property conveyed was community property. We are of opinion, however, that the charge is erroneous as being upon the weight of the evidence. It seems to have been held at an early day in this State, that where the title to community property is in the wife, she might, by the consent of her husband, dispose of it without his formally joining her in the conveyance. Thomas, Admr., v. Chance, 11 Texas, 634; Berry v. Wright, 14 Texas, 274. Doubtless this was the principle which the court intended to embody in the charge quoted above. We think, however, that he should have left it to the jury to infer the consent of the husband from the facts and circumstances introduced in evidence, and not have instructed them, in effect, that the facts from which they might infer such consent amounted as a matter of law to consent. The refusal to give appellant’s first special instruction, of which complaint is made in her third assignment, was not error, because this requested charge contained the erroneous theory of appellant in relation to the doctrine of common source of title indicated above. The remaining assignments, to-wit, the fourth and fifth, complain further of the court’s charge, and of the refusal to give appellant’s second special instruction. We are of opinion that this special instruction should have been given. While, as copied in the transcript, it contains some verbal inaccuracies, it substantially requested the court to charge the jury that- if it was the intention of Peter W. Wynne when the land was conveyed to his wife to donate it to her, it would amount to a gift and make it her separate property. It is true that in the court’s charge the jury were instructed in a general way that if the land was given to her by her husband it would be her separate property, but we think that this did not sufficiently direct the mind of the jury to the purpose of Peter W. Wynne in having the conveyance taken in the name of his wife, and especially so, in view of the further charge given by the court, that where a deed is made to the wife and there is no language in the deed tending to show that it is the separate property of the wife, the presumption is that it is the community property of the husband and wife. Plaintiff’s case in the trial court depended upon a proper determination of this -issue as to whether the presumption of community property was rebutted by proof showing that in taking the deed in the name of Mary M. Wynne the intention was to make it her separate property. The fact that Peter W. Wynne requested the deed made in that way, and the further fact that only a few months thereafter his wife, without his joinder, and apparently with his consent, made a deed of gift of the property to her son-in-law, were proper matters for the consideration of the jury, under a proper instruction, in arriving at the intention of Peter W. Wynne in having the deed taken in the name of his wife. Higgins v. Johnson, 20 Texas, 396; Smith v. Boquet, 27 Texas, 507; Peters v. Clements, 46 Texas, 125. We are further of opinion, that in submitting the statute of limitations the court should have qualified the charge by submitting in connection therewith appellant’s replication to the plea. That is to say, if the jury should have found that the property was the separate property of Mary M. Wynne, then they should have been instructed that the statute of limitations would not be a defense, if they should find that Mary M. Wynne continued to be the wife of Peter W. Wynne up-to and within less than five years before the filing of the suit. We call attention to this with a view to another trial. Appellees in their brief seek to sustain the judgment on the ground that they were innocent purchasers. This defense was alleged by them in the trial court and proof offered in support of their pleas. The issue, however, was not submitted to the jury, and there is nothing in this record to show that the court refused to submit this issue to the jury. We do not, therefore, feel called upon to announce any conclusion upon it. As to whether appellees could avail themselves of this defense, under the facts disclosed by the record, we do not decide, as we would not be warranted in presuming that the court upon another trial would not properly pass upon this issue. Delivered December 6, 1892. On the grounds stated above, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","Mrs. Ella Fox v. M. C. Brady et al. No. 47. 1. Bill of Exceptions. — A bill of exceptions to the exclusion of evidence should show that the evidence was excluded, and upon what objection, and that exception was taken to its exclusion. 2. Common Source of Title — Married Woman’s Deed. — The fact that both parties claim through the same deed to a married woman as a common source of title, will not preclude the defendant from, showing that the land thereby conveyed was community and not her separate property. 3. Wife’s Deed of Community Property Without Joinder of Husband. — It seems that where the title to community property is in the wife, she may by the consent of the husband dispose of it without his formally joining her in the conveyance. 4. Presumption of Community Property. — Where a deed is made to the wife, and there is no language in the deed tending to show that it is the separate property of the wife, the presumption is that it is community property. 5. Charge of Court — Special Instruction to be Given, when.— Although the court may have charged in a general way upon a given issue, yet if this be the determinative issue of the case, it is the duty of the court to give a requested charge pertinently applying the law to the facts in evidence relating to such issue. 6. Limitations — Married Woman. — Where a married woman conveys land which is her separate property, by deed in which her husband does not join, limitation will not run against her and in favor of the purchaser while she remains married. 7. Practice on Appeal — Issue Waived. — Where appellees in their brief seek to sustain the judgment on the ground that they are innocent purchasers, and it appears that this defense was alleged by them in the trial court, and proof offered in support of the plea, but the issue was not submitted to the jury, and there is nothing in the record to show that the court refused to so submit the issue, the appellate court is not properly called upon to announce any conclusion upon it. Appeal from Johnson. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. Smith & Davis and W. D. McKay, for appellant. 1. Appellees deraign title through Mary M. Wynne; and the legal title being in Mary M. Wynne, and appellees failing to show any outstanding equity with which they connect themselves, can not set up that it was community property of Mrs. Wynne and her husband. Edwards v. Brown, 68 Texas, 333; Peters v. Clements, 46 Texas, 125. 2. Because it is shown by the undisputed evidence that both the plaintiff and defendants claimed the land through Mary M. Wynne, the defendants could not set up title in Mary M. Wynne’s husband to defeat plaintiff’s recovery. Glover v. Tharas, 12 S. W. Rep., 684; Sedg. & Wait on Trial of Title, 2 ed., sec. 803. 3. The court erred in failing to give plaintiff’s second special charge, in effect, that Peter W. Wynne could donate property to his wife, and if he intended this land as a donation to her at the time the deed was made to her, that such intention made it her separate property. Peters v. Clements, 46 Texas, 125; Smith v. Boquet, 27 Texas, 513; Higgins v. Johnson, 20 Texas, 396. Bledsoe, Patton & Brown and Poindexter & Padelford, for appellees. 1. The chain of title introduced by appellant for the purpose of showing title from a common source, to-wit, Mary M. Wynne, and also introduced by appellees to show title in them (appellees) both by deed and under the statute of limitations, does not show common source of title, so as to preclude appellees from asserting and claiming that the title of said property sued for was the community estate of Peter W. Wynne and wife Mary M. Wynne, or from objecting to the oral declaration of said Wynne and wife in disparagement of the apparent community character of the title to said land. Wallace & Co. v.

Fox, and also the subsequent execution of a deed by said Fox to Jeff Wright to said land, which said last deed was also written by, and the acknowledgment thereto taken by and before, said Peter W. Wynne, was sufficient to pass and did pass to said Jeff Wright all the title of said Mary M. Wynne and Peter W.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This suit, in form of trespass to try title, was brought by appellants, McCurdy & Daniels, against Gr. W. Bullock, the appellee, for the Isaac Fessenden 320 acres survey in Bosque County, Defendant answered, that he was not in possession of the lands described in plaintiffs’ petition, and disclaimed any interest, right, title, or possession of the Isaac Fessenden 320 acres survey; but says that he is, and was at and prior to the institution of the suit, in the quiet and peaceable possession of 160 acres of land, part of the Charles E. Hawkins survey; beginning at the southeast corner of the Hawkins, “ thence north 30 west 752 varas to a tract sold J. W. Cartwright; thence south 60 west 1290 varas; thence south 30 east 752 varas; thence north 60 east 1290 varas to the beginning."" He then sets up title to the land so described by possession under the statute of five years limitation. He also pleads improvements made in good faith. It was admitted that plaintiffs owned the Fessenden 320 acres survey, and that defendant owned the 160 acres described in his answer, in the southeast corner of the Hawkins. The Fessenden survey of 320 acres was made May 24, 1850; the Hawkins survey, of nearly 4000 acres, was patented in 1854. Its last line from its southeast corner calls to run “ thence south 60 west with Fessenden’s and Kennedy’s lines 3093 varas to the beginning,” making a part of its south line identical with the north line of the Fessenden. The deed of Dunnan to defendant, under which he claims title by limitation under the five years statute, describes the 160 acres as out of the southeast corner of the Hawkins, describing it in his answer. There was a conflict in the testimony as to the boundary line between the Fessenden and the Hawkins. The court instructed the jury to ascertain the locality of this line and establish it; and also submitted to them a charge upon defendant’s plea of limitation. The jury returned the following verdict: “We, the jury, find the northwest corner of a survey made for George W. Lively, from which a live oak bears north 76 west 125 varas, marked K, another marked — bears north 77 west 125 varas; thence south 60 west, partly with the south line of the McFarland survey, 1900 varas to the northwest corner in prairie; thence south 30 east 770 varas, recrossed a creek 950 varas to corner, from which a live oak bears north 54 east 26 varas, marked D, another marked E bears north 87 east 33 varas. We, the jury, further find, that the defendant has had in peaceable possession for over five years the land sued for, and we find for defendant.” Thereupon judgment was rendered, declaring that it appeared from the verdict, “ that the north line of the Fessenden as originally located upon the ground began at the northwest corner of the George Lively survey, a pile of rocks, from which a live oak bears north 76 west 125 varas, marked It, and another live oak bears north 77 west 125 varas; thence south 60 west, partly with the south line of the McFarland survey, and at a point where the next boundary line of the said Fessenden survey would intersect said north line running north 30 west from the southwest corner of said Fessenden survey, which is a known comer.” It is then decreed, that the north line of the Fessenden 11 be and the same is hereby established”—where is not stated. The decree recites, that it further appears to the court from the verdict upon defendant’s plea of limitation, that defendant had been “in the quiet and peaceable possession of all that part of the Fessenden survey as claimed by him in his said plea of limitation, by deeds duly registered, describing the lines and corners on the ground of 160 acres out of the southeast corner of said Hawkins survey, and paying all taxes due thereon, occupying, cultivating, using, and enjoying the same for more than five years next before the filing of this suit; and it further appearing from said verdict, that the jury had found for defendant the land claimed by him as aforesaid, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court, that the plaintiffs, W. H. McCurdy and N. H. Daniels, composing the firm of McCurdy & Daniels, take nothing by their suit herein, and that the defendant, George Bullock, do have and recover of and from the plaintiffs the said land claimed and occupied by them; and that the said defendant, as to plaintiffs’ said suit herein, go hence without day, and that defendant recover of and from the said W. I-I. McCurdy and N. II. Daniels, plaintiffs,” and their sureties, all costs, etc. From this judgment the plaintiffs have appealed. The verdict of the jury is not explicit as to where they locate the north line of the Fessenden, whether it is where the plaintiffs claim it or where the defendant claims it. The verdict adds no calls to the calls as given in the field notes of the survey that will certainly enlighten us upon this subject. The verdict adopts the call in the Fessenden as its beginning corner, that is, the northwest corner of the Lively survey, witnessed by two live oaks, and then runs the course and distance as called in the Fessenden Survey to its northwest corner in the prairie. It then runs the course and 'distance, crossing a creek, as called in the Fessenden, to its southwest corner, identifying it by the two live oak bearing trees called for in the original survey. The evidence does show that there are two live oak trees on the ground (twin trees nearly answering to the call in the original field notes) where plaintiffs claim the corner to be; the trees are too young, however, and are not marked at all. If these are the trees intended by the verdict as locating the northeast corner, then the line run from this point as stated in the verdict would fix the boundary where plaintiffs contend it is. We can not be certain that this was the conclusion of the jury, because there is testimony tending to show that the southwest corner is identified by the bearing tree marked D where the defendant says.it is. From the entire verdict, we think it does nothing more, and intends nothing more, than to adopt the field notes as given in the Fessenden survey, without finding any known point or line. At all events, the verdict does not authorize a judgment for defendant establishing the line of the Hawkins and the Fessenden where he contends it is; and the judgment, if it does so, is incorrect. We do not pretend that it may not be so established, but only that the verdict does not so locate it. Had the verdict so located it, there would be an end of the controversy, as the plaintiffs could not recover any land on the Hawkins survey, and there would be no necessity to notice the finding on defendant’s plea of limitation. The court’s charge should have directed the jury, that if they found the line where defendant claimed it, to so declare, and to identify it by some known object, if the evidence furnished it. The same character of charge should have been given in case the line was found to be where plaintiffs claimed it, and, as we will hereafter see, such finding would have determined the suit. There is no question of limitation in the case, and, as insisted by appellants, no such issue should have been submitted to the jury. The deed read in evidence by defendant as a basis for his plea of limitation under the five years statute purports to convey a part of the Hawkins survejq and calls for no external objects that could place the survey outside the Hawkins. It would not authorize a recovery under the five years statute of any part of the Fessenden, wherever it proves to be. Possession and payment of taxes could only mature the deed into a good title; it could not amend the description of the land or apply the deed to other land. In this respect, the same question is raised in this case as in the case of' these plaintiffs, McCurdy & Daniels, against Locker, ante, p. 220, to which we refer. We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded; and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 18, 1893.","McCurdy & Daniels v. G. W. Bullock. No. 66. 1. Verdict Insufficient. — A verdict in a trial involving the locality of a common line between two surveys is insufficient unless it finds such locality from some known point or line. See example. 2. Limitation of Five Years.—Possession and payment of taxes of land for five years can only mature the deed under which possession is held into a good title. It can not amend a defective description in the deed. See example. Appeal from Bosque. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. J. K. Melton, for appellants. S. H. Lumpkin, for appellee."
"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This suit involves the title to the north quarter of the Patrick Rock league and labor survey of land, situated in Denton County. The land was patented to Patrick Rock in the year 1856, by virtue of a location made long prior thereto, Patrick Rock himself having died prior to 1848. He left surviving, his widow, Margaret Rock, who died in the year 1866, and three daughters, all of whom were dead at the institution of this suit. 1-Ie seems also to have left a son, who died at an early day, unmarried and without issue. Edmund Lee married one of these daughters, one Coward married another, and one Mason the third. Plaintiffs in error claim as the heirs of the wives of Lee and Coward, and the defendants claim under mesne conveyances from Mason and wife. The south half of this league seems to have passed into the hands of the locator, and there is no controversy about it. Nearly thirty years before the trial in the court below, according to the contention of all the parties, there was a paroi partition of the north half of the survey. The controversy arises upon the manner and extent of this partition. The theory of plaintiffs in error is, that the scope of the partition was limited to the undivided half-interest inherited by the three daughters from Patrick Rock, and that this undivided half-interest was divided equally between them, they taking the south half of the north half, and the surviving widow taking the land in controversy, to-wit, the north half of the north half. The theory of defendants in error is, that this verbal partition extended to the whole of the north half, and that the land in controversy was set apart to the wife of Mason and the surviving widow, to become the property of the former upon the death of the latter, and that the south half of the north half was divided equally between the other two daughters. A deed was read in evidence, without objection, bearing date 21st day of March, 1861, from Margaret Rock to her daughter Mary, the wife of Coward, conveying by metes and bounds a strip of 375 acres running east and west across the south half of the north half of the survey, and adjacent to the south boundary line of the north quarter. A bond for title was also read in evidence, executed in 1859 by Lee and Coward to G-. W. Lawler and George Wright, conveying a strip of 400 acres off the south side of the north half of the survey, leaving a strip of 375 acres between the land described in the Coward deed and in the Wright and Lawler bond, for which no conveyance seems to have been read in evidence, though it was in proof that Lee and wife had conveyed this land to other parties many years ago. Upon the back of the deed from Margaret Kock to Mary Coward was found a diagram, which indicated that the north half of the survey had been divided into four strips, running east and west; the south strip having written upon it “ George Wright and G. W. Lawler 400 acres;” the next strip north having written upon it “ Edmund Lee 375^^ acres;” and the next, 11 Mary Coward 375^^ acres;” and the last, “Margaret Eock 957-Aíj- acres;” and out of the northeast corner of this strip was cut a strip marked “ W. G. Nelson 200 acres.” Eunning across all these strips from north to south, near the east boundary, was an endorsement “ 2000 varas;” and across the three strips marked “ Wright and Lawler,” “ Edmund Lee,” and “Mary Coward,” an endorsement “1000 varas.” Plaintiffs in error objected to the introduction of this plat in evidence, and assign error upon its admission. The ground of objection, as set forth in their first proposition under the first assignment of error, was, that its execution had not been proven. This objection’S amplified in the proposition with the statement that it did not constitute the basis, in whole or in part, of the pleadings in the case; and it had not been shown by whom it was made, nor by what authority it was placed on the back of the deed. The bill of exceptions was approved with this explanation, viz.: “It is apparent from a comparison of the handwritings that said deed and plat were written by the same person, and they seem to be of the same age.” It has been held in this State, that the execution of a lost deed may be proven by circumstantial evidence. Crain v. Huntington, 81 Texas, 614, and case there cited. In view of the age of the deed, its evident genuineness, the death of all the parties, and the fact of a contemporaneous partition of some kind made by the parties, we think the evidence of identity in handwriting and age of the deed and plat tended sufficiently to show that the plat must have been the work of the parties to the deed to admit it in evidence, especially as it was not in conflict with the deed, but in explanation of it. Plaintiffs in error,- by requesting appropriate instructions, might perhaps have had this issue passed upon by the jury and the scope of the evidence limited, but nothing of this sort seems to have been done. This disposes of the first assignment of error. By the third subdivision of the charge, defendants’ theory of paroi partition was submitted to the jury, and the verdict indicates that they found for defendants in error under that subdivision of the charge. Error is assigned upon the giving of this charge, on the ground, as submitted by the plaintiffs’ proposition under the assignment, that there was not sufficient evidence to fairly raise the issue of fact to which it relates. No objection is taken to the validity or legal effect of the kind of partition submitted by the charge and passed upon by the jury. By the third assignment, plaintiffs in error complain of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict. It thus appears that these two assignments raise substantially the same question. We have carefully considered the statement of facts: and in view of the long lapse of time; of the inherent difficulty, therefore, of making clear proof of the exact manner of the paroi partition; of the fact that the deed and title bond mentioned above were inconsistent with plaintiff’s theory of the partition; of the further fact, that for nearly thirty years the defendants in error and those under whom they claim seem to have acted upon a theory of partition which excluded all interest in plaintiffs in error; and of the conduct of plaintiffs’ ancestors in disposing of the lands allotted to them in the partition, and not asserting title to any other portion of said survey until after so great a lapse of time, we have reached the conclusion, that the settlement of this controversy by the verdict of the jury should not be disturbed. Believing the testimony, under the circumstances, to be sufficient to support the verdict, and there being no other questions submitted for our determination, we are brought to the conclusion that the judgment must be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 16, 1893.","M. A. Linam et al. v. R. B. Anderson et al. No. 123. 1. Evidence—Ancient Instrument — Maps.—Where a paroi partition of land in controversy had been made nearly thirty years before, and the issue was as to the manner and extent of the partition, defendants introduced a deed for part of the land, executed in 1861 by one of the parties to the partition, having on its back a plat showing the land divided in a certain way, with amounts and names of the parties written thereon. From a comparison of the handwritings it appeared that the deed and plat were made by the same person and were of the same age. Held, that in view of the age and evident genuineness of the deed, the death of the parties, and the fact that a contemporaneous partition of some kind was made, the plat had been properly admitted in evidence, especially as it was explanatory of the deed. 2. Parol Partition —Evidence Held Sufficient. — Where, from long lapse of time and death of the parties, clear proof could not be made as to the exact manner of a paroi partition, and the action of plaintiffs’ ancestors in disposing of a part of the land, and asserting no claim of further interest therein for many years, was consistent with defendants’ theory of the partition upon which defendants and their ancestors appeared to have acted for nearly thirty years, and which was corroborated by a deed and plat shown in evidence, a verdict in favor of defendants should not be disturbed. Error from Denton. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Smith & Bell and W. C. Morgan, for plaintiffs in error. 1. The map or plat showing a subdivision of the north half of the Patrick Rock league and labor survey, attached to and written upon the back of the deed from Margaret Rock to Mary Coward, was a private writing or memorandum, and neither constituted, in whole or in part, the basis of the pleadings in this cause, and was not admissible in evidence without first proving its execution; and there being no evidence introduced as to its execution, nor when and by whom the same was made, nor by what authority the same was placed on the back of said deed, the court erred in admitting the same in evidence, over objection of plaintiffs. Renn v. Samos, 33 Texas, 760; Abb. Trial Ev., 564. 2.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the County Court of Fort Bend County, at the suit of the appellee, against the appellant. The basis of the suit was alleged injury to the growing crop of plaintiff, resulting from the alleged negligence of defendant in the construction of its roadbed lying near to the lands leased and cultivated by appellee. The plaintiff laid his damages in the sum of $840, and obtained judgment for the sum of $560. The appellant filed general and special demurrers, and pleaded general denial; and specially denied that its roadbed was negligently constructed, and averred that it was constructed with due care and skill; and averred further, that the damage to the crops of plaintiff was the result of plaintiff’s own negligence. The first assignment of error is, that the court erred in not sustaining defendant’s demurrer to so much of plaintiff’s “ amended petition as set up claim for damages to his crops on the 5th of June, 1890, because such claim was a new cause of action, and one which accrued, if such existed, long after the institution of plaintiff’s suit.” We think there was no error committed by the court in overruling this demurrer. Upon the trial there was evidence tending to show, that plaintiff’s crops could have been protected from overflow by a ditch, and that such ditch might have been opened at a cost of $300; and it is insisted by appellant, under his sixth assignment of error, that the evidence showed such contributory negligence on the part of appellee as should defeat his right to recover for an injury against which he might have protected himself. The law on this subject is thus stated by Mr. Field in his work on Damages (section 21): “It is the duty of a party to protect himself from the injurious consequences of the wrongful act of another, if he can do so by ordinary effort and care or at a moderate expense, for which effort and expense he may charge the wrongdoer. And where by use of such means he may prevent loss, he can only recover for such loss as could not thus be prevented.” We do not think it can be said in reference to this case, that the cutting of a ditch at a cost of $300 would have been but “ ordinary care and effort” on the part of appellee, nor that the outlay of $300 could be termed “a moderate expense.” The appellee was not required to make such an expenditure to protect his property from injury resulting from the alleged negligence of appellant. Besides, the evidence discloses that the appellee is not the owner, but the lessee, of the land upon which he was farming, and it is doubtful whether under any circumstances a lessee would be required to cut a ditch, such as the one proposed, for his protection against the wrongful act of another. A tenant under an ordinary lease would have no authority to make such change or alteration in the property of his landlord. The appellant’s objections to the evidence offered and admitted by the court to ascertain the value of the crops alleged to have been destroyed, we think are well taken; and for the error of the court in permitting witnesses for the plaintiff to testify as to the cost of planting and cultivating the crops up to the time of their alleged destruction, without further evidence, the cause must be reversed. Railway v. McGowan, 73 Texas, 355; Railway v. Pape, 73 Texas, 502. In these cases it is held, that the most satisfactory means of determining the value of a growing crop at any stage of its existence, is to prove its probable yield under proper cultivation, the value of such, a yield when matured and ready for sale, and also the expense of producing the crop, harvesting it, and preparing it for and transporting it to market. When a witness, whose opinion is admissible as evidence, shows by his testimony that his opinion is formed from insufficient data, the evidence should be rejected. Had the opinions of the witnesses whose testimony was objected to by appellant been given without showing upon what their opinions were formed, the witnesses having qualified themselves as experts, their opinions would have been- admissible in evidence. For the error of the court in admitting the testimony, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for another trial. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 16, 1893.","Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company v. J. B. Borsky. No. 217. 1. Damages — New Cause of Action. — The suit was filed January 31, 1890, and was to recover for injury to the growing crops of the plaintiff resulting from the alleged negligent construction of the roadbed of defendant near the lands leased and cultivated by the plaintiff. By amendment the plaintiff set up further claim for damages to his crop on June 5, 1890. There was no error committed by the court in overruling a demurrer to this amendment; demurrer being based upon the ground that it was a new cause of action. 2. Contributory Negligence—Duty of Plaintiff to Protect Himself.—Plaintiff’s crops could have been protected by the construction of a ditch which would have cost §300. The plaintiff was not required to make such an expenditure to protect his property from injury resulting from the alleged negligence of appellant. Besides, he was a lessee, and it is doubtful whether under any circumstances a lessee would be required to cut such a ditch for his protection against the wrongful act of another, and under an ordinary lease he would have no authority to do so. 3. Measure of Damages —How Arrived at. —There was errpr in allowing evidence of the cost of planting and cultivating the cropa up to the time of their destruction. The most satisfactory means of determining the value of the growing crop, at any stage of its existence, is to prove its prohable yield-under proper cultivation, the value of such yield matured and ready for market, and the expense of producing the crop and transporting it to market. 4. Expert Testimony.—Had the opinion of witnesses objected to by appellant been given without showing upon what their opinions were formed, they having qualified themselves as experts, their opinions would have been admissible. Appeal from Fort Bend. Tried below before Hon. M. J. Hickey, County Judge. Pearson & Ballowe, for appellant. The only proper way of ascertaining the value of a growing crop at any stage of its existence, is to prove what that character of crop was worth at or near the place where it was grown when matured, and to make proper estimates and allowances from ascertained or ascertainable facts for contingencies and expenses attending its further cultivation and care.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. Appellant S. C. Gatewood, according to the testimony of herself and husband, J. C. Gatewood, was induced to join in the conveyance of their homestead, the separate property of the husband, in consideration of the proceeds of the sale becoming her separate property. In pursuance of this understanding, the homestead was conveyed and the money and notes received in payment were delivered to the wife as her separate property. Thereafter a portion ■of the money was invested in cattle, which, by the terms of the bill of sale, were conveyed to the separate use of the wife. Subsequently, thirty-six of these cattle were seized under execution as the property of the husband, and were promptly claimed by the wife, who prosecutes this appeal from a judgment rendered against her.. There was a trial by jury, but the court instructed them to return a verdict for appellees; holding, in effect, that personal property received in payment for the homestead of an insolvent debtor, when transferred to the wife to be her separate property, upon the sole consideration of obtaining her consent to the sale, is not thereby withdrawn from the reach of the husband’s creditors. The very opposite of this is decided in the case of Blum v. Light, 81 Texas, 414, the facts of which are quite similar to the facts of this case. That case, however, was not reported until after the trial in this case. It follows, that the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, in order that the jury, under a proper charge, may pass upon the facts and determine whether the transaction between Gatewood and wife is really what it purports to be or only colorable; and it is accordingly so ordered.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This action was originally brought in a Justice Court of Johnson County, by the City of Alvarado against appellant, to recover $150 as license tax imposed by said city upon the occupation of a retail liquor dealer. Appellee sued as a municipal corporation, claiming to be duly incorporated under the laws of the State. Appellant filed a written plea in the Justice Court, termed by him a plea to the jurisdiction, in which he set up that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain a suit to collect taxes, and in support of this position alleged, that the ordinance levying the tax was invalid for want of the two-thirds majority of the city council in its adoption, and that the ordinance which directed the suit to be brought against this appellant (naming him) for a failure to pay occupation taxes was a discrimination against him, though alleged to have been enacted for his especial benefit. This plea also alleged that a criminal prosecution had been instituted in the Mayor’s Court of said city of Alvarado on account of the nonpayment of these taxes, in which a fine had been adjudged against appellant, from which an appeal had been taken to the County Court, where the prosecution was still pending. This plea was sworn to. In addition, appellant answered, setting up that appellee had attempted to adopt as its charter the general law providing for the charter of cities and towns of over 1000 inhabitants, but that this was ineffectual, because not adopted by a two-tliirds majority of the city council. This plea was not sworn to, nor was there any plea filed by appellant in writing and sworn to which denied that appellee was a corporation as claimed by it. Delivered November 29, 1892. The appellee recovered judgment in the Justice Court for §150, and on appeal in the County Court, for §150 and §6.25 interest, from which last judgment this appeal is prosecuted. We conclude that, in the absence of a sworn plea denying that the city of Alvarado was a corporation, the court did not err in overruling this defense of appellant. We are also of the opinion that the evidence warranted the County Court in the finding that the ordinance imposing the tax was legally enacted, and that under article 433 of the Revised Statutes the city of Alvarado could maintain a suit to recover the taxes. We, however, find no authority for said city to recover interest in addition to the taxes. This part of the judgment therefore can not be sustained. Cave v. Houston, 65 Texas, 622; Tel. Co. v. The State, 55 Texas, 319; Galveston v. Heard, 54 Texas, 420; Edmonson v. Galveston, 53 Texas, 157. For authorities in support of the power of the city to maintain the suit for taxes, see Howard v. Mayor, 59 Texas, 77, and the above case cited in 65 Texas. We are of opinion that the pendency of the criminal prosecution was not a bar to this action, this remedy being cumulative, and it not being shown that the criminal prosecution had resulted in the collection of said taxes. It is concluded that the judgment should be reformed by omitting therefrom the recovery of interest, and affirmed in the recovery of the amount of the taxes, and that the costs of this appeal be adjudged against appellee. jReformed.","A.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This action was brought against the plaintiffs in error, as receivers of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company in Texas, to recover damages for personal injuries received by the wife of the defendant in error while a passenger on a train on said railway during the time it was being operated by said receivers. Plaintiffs in error pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, that at the time of the accident the railway was being operated by them as receivers, through employes, under appointment and orders of the Circuit Court of the United States in and for the Eastern District of Texas, and that the cause of action they are sued on is not any act or transaction of theirs as receivers, and that the consent of said Circuit Court had not been obtained for the institution of the suit. Since the passage of the act of Congress authorizing suits against a receiver without leave of the court in which the receivership may be pending, it has not been necessary to obtain such leave. The cause of action in this case is an act or transaction of the receivers which comes within the act of Congress. Brown v. Gay, 76 Texas, 444. There is no attempt by the act of Congress to confer jurisdiction upon the courts of any State which they did not have before. By a comity between courts, it is a well settled rule of law that a receiver of property appointed by one court can not be sued in another with respect to that property without the consent of the court appointing him. Such a suit would be in contempt of the court whose officer the receiver was, punishable by that court; and if brought to the attention of the court in which it is instituted by a proper plea, the right to maintain it would be refused. The act of Congress, as well as our State law, authorizing suits against receivers without the consent of the courts by which they were appointed, changes the rule; but both these acts protect the courts having jurisdiction of the original cause in which the receivership is being conducted in the due administration thereof; and the provision of the Federal statute that “ such suit shall be subject to the general equity jurisdiction of the court in which such receiver or manager was appointed, so far as the same shall be necessary to the ends of justice,” is probably no greater reservation of power than courts appointing receivers would have generally, to be exercised by injunction against the parties, not the courts, to prevent interference with or a diversion of the property in the hands of the receiver. Green Sanders, a witness for the plaintiff, was permitted to testify, over the objection of the defendant, that he"" had visited the scene of the wreck where Mrs. Withers was injured, and saw some old timbers lying around the place of the wreck and some new work done there; that old ties had been taken out and new ones put in, or the ties that were there before had been reset; the work was new or recent at that place, and the ties that were there had no marks on them made by a wheel running off the rail on to the ties. This testimony does not come within the rule as announced in Railway v. Johnston, 78 Texas, 536, and Railway v. McGowan, 73 Texas, 355. The defendants’ witnesses had -testified to the good condition of the track, and that it was used after the wreck without having been repaired, and the evidence was properly admitted in rebuttal thereof. It was also admissible for the purpose of showing the actual condition of the track, but not for the purpose of showing an admission by the defendants that the track was defective. It was, however, error to permit the witness to testify as to other wrecks. Railway v. Mitchell, 75 Texas, 81. The eighth, ninth, and tenth assignments of error are to the refusal of the court to give the first, second, and third special instructions requested by the defendants, which are as follows: “1. If the evidence in this case shows to their (the jury’s) satisfaction that the car upon which Mrs. Withers was a passenger ran off the track and was overturned, and that she was injured, and if the evidence fails to disclose any defect in the machinery connected with the train, or any defect in the road bed, rails, or ties, and fails to show any mismanagement or conduct upon the part of those operating the train, then it would be your duty to return a verdict for defendants. “2. If the evidence in the case shows that the car upon which Mrs. Withers was a passenger was overturned, and there is no cause or reason shown for the overturning of the car, and if the defendants have shown that the road bed and cars and machinery connected therewith were suitable and in good condition, and that the operatives of the train were in exercise of reasonable care and prudence in the management and running of the train, then the jury would not be authorized to return a verdict for the plaintiff, and you will find for the defendants. “3. Railway companies in carrying passengers, under the law, do not become insurers of the safety of passengers, and are not liable for injuries which result from an accident produced by any latent defects in machinery or road bed, which could not have been foreseen and provided against by due care in relation to the business of operating such railways; and if you believe from the evidence in this case that the wreck in which Mrs. Withers was injured was accidentally brought about by some unexplained defect, which could not have been seen and provided against by the defendants in this case by the exercise of such prudence and care as reasonably cautious persons would have exercised under the circumstances, then the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, and you should return a verdict for defendants.” While in this State the happening of an accident to a passenger does not make a prima facie case of negligence, as held in some States (Railway v. Robinson, 73 Texas, 284; Railway v. Burnett, 80 Texas, 538), still the derailment of a passenger car of a railway company is evidence of negligence in the company in the absence of any explanation showing that the accident happened without fault of the railway company. Railway v. Smith, 74 Texas, 276. The first and second instructions as above requested ask for a finding for the defendants on a state of facts which ignores the accident. Such a charge would be upon the weight of evidence. All of the facts should be submitted to the jury, and they should find whether or not there was negligence. The third instruction requested is correct, with a further explanation to the jury as to what prudence and care reasonably cautious persons would have exercised under the circumstances, which, as laid down in Railway v. Halloren, 53 Texas, 53, is, “ that high degree of care and skill which very cautious persons generally, in their line of business, are accustomed to use under similar circumstances, to prevent danger.” In this connection, the following charge of the court was error: “ The defendants in this cause, as carriers of passengers operating a railway, are held under the law to the greatest possible care and diligence for the safety of the passengers they undertake to transport; they are not insurers of the absolute safety of their passengers, but they are required to provide for their safe conveyance as far as human care and foresight will go. And their duty extends to the providing of good and sufficient material, the employment of skilled engineers, correct methods in the original construction, inspection, and subsequent maintenance in repair of its road, embankments, culverts, road bed, ties, and of the engines and cars which it uses, and the speed of its trains in the transportation of its passengers; and a failure of duty in any of these respects renders the defendants liable.” Delivered December 8, 1892. Too great care is imposed upon the defendants as carriers of passengers by this charge. Defendants are not bound to the greatest possible care. Their obligation is very correctly stated in Railway v. Halloren, 53 Texas, 53, and we do not deem it necessary to do more than refer to that case for the guidance of the court in framing the charge on another trial of this case. There was no error in refusing the eleventh and thirteenth requested instructions. While the defendants’ ties or the unusual speed may not separately have caused the derailment of- the train, yet each may have contributed to it. A diminished capacity to earn money is a proper element of damage. It is true there was no evidence showing what Mrs. Withers could have earned before the injuries complained of were received, and what she could earn afterward; yet the evidence showed that in the discharge of her duties about the management of the hotel her capacity was diminished; and while it amounts to much the same thing, the charge of the court should have submitted to the jury her diminished capacity to do the work she was accustomed to do about the hotel, rather than a diminished capacity to earn money, as there was no evidence directly as to what that was. We do not deem it necessary to pass on the sixth assignment of error, relating to the admission of evidence on the part of the plaintiff after the case had been closed, and the refusal to hear evidence of the defendants in rebuttal thereof, as the case must be reversed for errors already pointed out, and the error assigned is not likely to occur on another trial. It was improper for counsel for plaintiff to state to the jury that he had drawn the petition under facts in cases not so bad as this, and had put the amount claimed as low as he thought he could, and other language to the same effect. He was, in effect, testifying before the jury, and the language called for something more from the court than a mere direction to the jury not to regard it. The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","Fordyce and Swanson, Receivers Saint Louis, Arkansas Texas Railway Company, v. L. M. Withers. No. 51. 1. Suits Against Receivers. — This was a suit for damages for personal injuries. Since the passage of the act of Congress authorizing suits against receivers without leave of the court in which the receivership may be pending, it has not been necessary to obtain such leave. The cause of action in this case is an act or transaction of the receivers which comes within the act of Congress. 2. Power of Court Under Act of Congress. — The rule of law, that a receiver of property appointed by one court can not be sued in another with respect to that property without the consent of the court appointing him, has been changed both by the act of Congress and the State law; but both of these acts protect the courts having jurisdiction of the original cause in which the receivership is being conducted, in the due administration thereof, and enable them, in the exercise of their general equity powers, to prevent, by injunction against parties, any interference with or diversion of the property in the hands of the receiver. 3. Evidence of Repair of Track. — Evidence tending to prove repair of the track at the place where the wreck and injury occurred, after its occurrence, was admissible when offered to rebut evidence of defendants"" witnesses, that the track had been used after the wreck without having been repaired. 4. Derailment of Passenger Car. — In this State, the happening of an accident to a passenger does not make a prima facie case of negligence, but the derailment of a passenger car is evidence of negligence in the company, in the absence of explanation showing that the accident happened without the fault of the railway company'; and instructions asking a finding for the defendant upon a state of facts which ignore the accident would have been on the weight of evidence, and were properly refused. 5. Carrier of Passengers — Erroneous Charge. — The following charge held to impose too great care upon the carrier of passengers: “Defendants, as carriers of passengers, operating a railroad, are held under the law to the greatest possible care and diligence for the safety of the passengers they undertake to transport. They are not insurers of the absolute safety of their passengers, but are required to provide for their safety as far as human care and foresight will go.” 6. Elements of Damage. — A diminished capacity to earn money is a proper element of damage, although the amount the injured person could earn before the injury, and the amount she did earn after it, was not shown. Her diminished capacity to do the work she was accustomed to do about the hotel was shown, and the charge should have submitted that question to the jury, rather than her diminished capacity to earn money. 7. Improper Argument of Counsel. — It was improper for counsel to state to the jury, “that he had drawn the petition under facts, in cases not so bad as this, and had put the amount claimed as low as he thought he could.” He was in effect testifying before the jury, and the language called for more from the court than a mere direction to the jury not to regard it.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. This is a suit by appellee against appellant, for damages resulting to his wife when a passenger on the cars of defendant’s railway. It is alleged, that on the 21st day of December, 1887, the wife of appellee purchased a coupon ticket over the line of-appellant’s road from Lampasas, Texas, via Wolfe City, Texas, to Montgomery, Alabama, and return. That upon her return trip, and while the ticket was in force, and while she was a passenger by virtue thereof upon appellant’s road between Temple and Lampasas, Texas, the conductor of appellant’s road would not accept the ticket for her passage, but demanded an additional fare from Temple to Lampasas, and that in his demand he acted arbitrarily, rudely, and harshly, and attempted to eject her from the train at Belton, Texas, and in order to prevent it she paid the extra fare demanded. This is denied by appellant; and it further alleges, that the time in which the ticket could be used had expired, and that it rightfully demanded the extra fare. Verdict and judgment in favor of appellee for $2082.25. The ticket embodies the following conditions: “Issued by Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway. Excursion ticket. Good for one first class passage to point between punch marks on Louisville & Nashville Railroad and return, when officially stamped on back hereof, and presented with coupon attached, subject to the following contract: In consideration of the reduced rates at which this ticket is sold, it is expressly agreed between the purchaser and the railroad companies over whose lines this ticket reads, as follows: “ First. That in selling this ticket the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company acts as an agent, and is not responsible beyond its own line. “Second. That this ticket is not transferable, and no stop-over at any intermediate point will be allowed unless specially provided for by the local regulations of- the lines over which it reads. “ Third. That any alteration whatever of this ticket renders it void. “ Fourth. That it is good for going passage only three days from date of sale, as stamped on the back hereof and written below. “ Fifth. That it is not good for return passage unless the holder identifies himself as the original purchaser to the satisfaction of the authorized agent of the Louisville &.Nashville Railroad at Montgomery, on or before January 20, 1888; and when officially signed and dated in ink, and duly stamped on back hereof by said agent, this ticket shall"" then be good only three days after such date. “ Sixth. That I, the original purchaser, hereby agree to sign my name and otherwise identify myself as such whenever called upon to do so by any conductor or agent of the line or lines over which the ticket reads. “ Seventh. That baggage liability is limited to wearing apparel, not exceeding $100 in value. “ Eighth. That the coupons belonging to this ticket will not be received for passage if detached. ‘ ‘ Ninth. That my signature must be in manuscript and ink. “ Tenth. That unless all the conditions of this ticket are fully complied with it shall be void. “ Eleventh. That I will not hold any of the lines named in this ticket liable for damages on account of any statement not in"" accordance with this contract, made by any employe of said lines. ‘ ‘ Twelfth. And it is specially agreed and understood by me, that no agent or employe of any of the lines named in this ticket has any power to alter, modify, or waive in any manner any of the conditions named in this contract. “ Mrs. J. W. Wright, Purchaser. “ C. L. Moody, Agent.” Attached to and following the above were the coupons for passage, there being but one unused at time of the attempted ejection of plaintiff’s wife from the cars of defendant, and this coupon called for passage from Wolfe City to Lampasas. It appears from the evidence, that at the time the ticket was presented and refused by the conductor, the wife of appellee was on her return trip, and that more than three days had expired after it was officially signed and stamped at Montgomery, Alabama, by the agent. 1. The appellant complains of the following charge given by the court: “ Now, if you find from the evidence that plaintiff’s wife presented said ticket to defendant’s agent after the 18th day of January, 1888, then you are instructed, that said ticket was invalid, and defendant’s agent was justified in demanding payment of fare from Temple to Lampasas, and upon failure to pay such fare, the agent would be justified in ejecting the holder of such ticket from the car, unless you further believe from the evidence that the defendant, or some one or more of said connecting lines, caused the delay and failure of Mrs. Wright to present her ticket within the three days limitation.” In view of the express agreement between the parties, wherein it was stipulated that the appellant was not liable beyond its own lines, we must hold this charge erroneous. It makes the appellant liable for delays occurring on lines of road other than its own. The rule is well settled in this State, that the liability of the carrier by contract can be limited and confined to its line of road. In cases of this kind, we believe the correct rule to be, that the carrier has the right to limit its liability to its own line, but when it undertakes to sell a ticket to be used within a certain time, it must see that the time agreed upon is reasonable from the standpoint of the then existing circumstances and conditions, and that the passenger, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may perform and complete his journey within the time agreed. A time fixed in which the ticket may be used, less than is sufficient to accomplish that purpose, would be a limitation of time imposed which could not be reasonable under the circumstances. Agreements of this character are permitted by the law upon the theory that they are reasonable. The carrier selling the ticket must know of the movements of the trains and their connections over the lines of road that it sells, and the difficulties naturally and usually resulting in travel over those lines. This is necessarily so in determining if the time in which the passage is limited is reasonable. Whether the time in which a ticket is to be used is reasonable, is ascertained from all the facts and circumstances existing at the time the contract was made and the time the ticket should be used. From these facts the jury must determine whether the limitation imposed was reasonable, and if the journey could, by ordinary diligence upon the part of the passenger, be accomplished within that period. In submitting the question to the jury, as to the liability of appellant for failure of the wife of appellee to reach the line of appellant’s road before the ticket expired, it should be in connection with a proper rule of law submitting to them the right to ascertain if, from the facts and circumstances, the time agreed upon was not reasonably sufficient for that purpose. If from the facts and circumstances existing at the time the contract of carriage was entered into, as to the connections and movements of the trains over the several lines of road, and reasonable changes that were likely to be made in the schedules of the movements of trains, and from the natural and usual difficulties that are likely to be inet by a traveller over the route, and that are of such a character that the carrier selling the ticket is likely to contemplate, the time agreed upon is not sufficient to accomplish the journey, it can then be said that the limitation imposed is unreasonable. 2 Woods Ry. Law, 1403, 1406. 2. The appellee was permitted to testify, over the objection of the appellant, as to statements and representations made by the ticket agent of appellant when the ticket was purchased, as to the movement of trains over the route covered by the ticket, and the advice of such agent to purchase the ticket over those lines. We think this evidence was properly admitted. 2 Wood’s Ry. Law, 1395; Burham v. Railway, 63 Me., 298; Van Kirk v. Railway, 76 Pa. St., 66. This fact was not necessary to be pleaded in order to admit the evidence. It was admissible in showing the knowledge of appellant as to the proper route to be travelled and as to the movements of the trains. While it is true the passenger should know of the movements of the trains over his intended line of travel, he is only required to obtain his information from some source that he can rely upon. We know of no more reliable source of information than the road that sells the ticket. .All this testimony was admissible upon the question as to whether the appellant had the opportunity to know if the time agreed upon in which the ticket should be used was unreasonable, and was further admissible in showing diligence upon the part of the purchaser of the ticket in ascertaining the movements of trains over the line called for by the ticket. 3. The court did not err in refusing to give the special charge number 3 requested by appellant, to the effect, that “as between the conductor and the passenger, the ticket was the only evidence of the right of the passenger to ride, and that the conductor was not required to enter into an investigation as to failure to present the ticket upon defendant’s line before its limitation had expired.” The passenger, when called upon for the extra fare, stated the reasons why she did not present the ticket before the three days expired in which it could be used. The effect of her statements tended to show, that she had used due diligence in her return trip, and that the time limited in the ticket was not sufficient for her to accomplish the journey. She had a right to rely upon the contract, and if from the facts and circumstances the time limited by the terms of the ticket for her to make the return trip was not a reasonable time for such purpose, the law would imply as one of the conditions of the contract that she should have a reasonable time in which to make and conclude the journey. This was a matter to be determined by the jury. She had the right to state the facts as she understood they were, and insist that her rights should be controlled by the contract as existed between her and appellant. She was under no obligation to pay another agent of appellant á sum in excess of that agreed upon with appellant as the amount stipulated for her transportation. When she stated to the conductor the facts tending to show that the time agreed upon was not reasonable, it was equivalent to an explanation made to appellant, and the appellant could no more justify the conduct of the conductor in exacting additional fare than it could a like exaction directly made by it. If in such a case the passenger should be right, the carrier can not exact the performance of conditions contrary to the rights of the passenger under the contract. It assumes the responsibility of any wrong it or its servants in authority may commit under the circumstances. Railway v. Martino, 18 S. W. Rep., 1068; Railway v. Mackie, 71 Texas, 494; Railway v. Bray, 25 N. E. Rep., 439; 125 Ind., 229; Wightman v. Railway, 40 N. W. Rep., 691; Head v. Railway, 7 S. E. Rep., 217; Railway v. Bamberg, 16 Atl. Rep., 67. 4. In answer to the objection made to the charge, the appellee contends that if error was committed, it was abstract; because the ticket should be so construed that the passenger was only required to commence her journey within the three days after the ticket was officially signed and stamped, and was not required to complete it within that time, as the facts indisputably show that she did commence the journey within the three days. The court below, we think, correctly construed this clause in the ticket to mean that the journey should be completed within the three days. If we understand it, this was the effect given to the ticket by the court below. This construction is correct, unless the time stated in the ticket may be controlled or extended by facts showing that it was not a reasonable time in which to accomplish the journey. Railway v. Looney, 85 Texas, 158. The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 22, 1893.","Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. J. W. Wright. No. 79. 1. Limited Excursion Railway Tickets — Reasonable Restrictions.—The rule is well settled, that the liability of a carrier by contract can be limited and confined to its own line of road. But when a railway company undertakes to sell an excursion ticket to be used within a certain time, it must see that the time agreed upon is reasonable, from the standpoint of the then existing circumstances and conditions, and that the passenger, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may complete his journey within the time agreed upon. If such time be reasonable, the railway company selling such ticket with liability limited to its own line would not be liable for delay by other lines on the route, and could insist upon the terms of the ticket when presented after the time specified therein. 2. Statements of Ticket Agent.—The statements made by the ticket agent selling a limited excursion ticket are competent in evidence against the railway company on subject of the movement of the trains, etc., and to show whether the limit of time of the ticket was reasonable under the circumstances. 3. Declarations of Ticket Holder.—The declarations of a holder of an excursion ticket, made to the conductor when he demanded payment of fare notwithstanding the ticket, are competent when tending to explain the delay of the holder in not presenting the ticket before the limit had expired, and when they tended to show that the limit of time in the ticket was not reasonable. Appeal from Lampasas. Tried below before Hon. W. A. Blackburn. J. W. Terry, for appellant. 1. A through ticket, with separate coupons attached for each road, is in legal effect a separate and distinct contract with each road, and does not render the company selling the same liable for the negligence or miscarriage of the other companies or any of them.

Y., 281; Pennsylvania Co. v. Hine, 41 Ohio St., 276; Harris v. Howe, 74 Texas, 534. 3. Conductor Kimball, who refused the ticket for passage, was not concluded by the action of the first conductor on appellant’s road in accepting it for passage after its limitation had expired. The ticket itself expressly provided that no employe of the appellant should have the authority to waive or modify the same, and was of itself express notice to the passenger that the first conductor did not have such power. Moreover, there was nothing in the action of the first conductor to operate as an estoppel, as when he received the plaintiff’s ticket for passage he advised her that she might thereafter have trouble about it. Dietrich v. Railway, 71 Pa. St., 434; Beebe v. Ayres, 28 Barb., 276; Hill v. Railway, 63 N. Y., 101; Johnson v. Railway, 46 N. H., 213; Stone v. Railway, 47 Iowa, 82; Kelley v. Railway, 67 Me., 173; Wakefield v. Railway, 117 Mass., 544; Sherman v. Railway, 40 Iowa, 45; Thorpe v. Railway, 17 Atl. Rep., 791. 4. While it may be true that the initial line would be liable in damages for selling a ticket over connecting lines with a limitation thereon, which, according to the schedules then in force, the trains being on time, would not enable a passenger to complete the 'journey within the limits prescribed by the ticket; yet when such objection is made, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show the fact, and that, according to the schedules then in force, the limits prescribed by the ticket did not afford sufficient time for the journey. 5. In the nature of things, the ticket held by the passenger must be to the conductor the only evidence of the passenger’s right to transportation thereon. It would be an impracticable and unreasonable rule to require the conductor to enter into a judicial investigation on the train, to determine whether from matters de hors the ticket the passenger was entitled to transportation, notwithstanding the ticket on its face does not entitle the passenger to transportation thereon. Hence, under such circumstances, it is the duty of the passenger to pay fare, and to look to the party whose negligence may have rendered the ticket insufficient for any damages that may have been sustained. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff can not recover for expulsion by the conductor, who was in the discharge of his duty. Mosher v. Railway, 127 U. S., 390; Mosher v. Railway, 17 Fed.

Browning and W. B. Abney, for appellee. Although the ticket held by plaintiff’s wife may have required the journey to be completed within three days, and although this may have been a sufficient time under ordinary circumstances, still if the delay and consequent failure to complete the journey within said three days was occasioned through no fault of plaintiff’s wife, but was on account of the delays in the connecting lines, and defendant had notice of this fact, or might have known it by the exercise of ordinary diligence, then defendant could not refuse to receive said ticket for passage after the expiration of said time.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. By this action appellant sought to recover of appellees lot 1, in block 13, in the city of Abilene. The petition was in the usual form of trespass to try title. Appellee J. B. Leavell, one of the defendants below, after pleading the general denial, set up-that S. .H. Leavell, one of his codefendants, on the 30th of August, 1886, executed to him a deed to the property in controversey, which was intended to be a mortgage to secure a loan of $1000, and prayed to recover in this action the sum of money secured by said mortgage, with a foreclosure of the mortgage lien. No reply was filed by appellant to this answer and cross-action, The 'cause was submitted to the court below without a jury upon an agreed statement of facts, which, so far as is important to be here set out, is as follows; the agreement being that the evidence would develop: “ 1. That S. H. and S. K. Leavell conveyed lot 1, in block 13, in Abilene, Texas, to J. B. Leavell by deed dated August 30, 1886. “ 2. That the said deed is an absolute warranty deed in form, but was intended by the parties as a mortgage to secure J. B. Leavell in the payment of a note for $1000, and interest. “ 3. That in the fall of 1888, J. B. Leavell conveyed the said lot back to S. H. Leavell by deed of general warranty. “ 4. That this deed was made with the verbal understanding that it was to enable S. H. Leavell to sell and convey as his own the said lot to Joseph Strickland, with whom he was negotiating a sale of all his property, including this lot, for a stock of hardware. “ 5. That it was verbally agreed and understood between J. B. and S. H. Leavell, at the time of making the said deed and at the time said deed was put in the possession of said S. II. Leavell, that said deed was not to operate as a conveyance of a title to said S. H. Leavell, unless said sale to Strickland was consummated; and in the event S. H. Leavell should fail to make said sale, said deed was to be returned to J. B. Leavell. Plaintiff reserved the right to object to any evidence tending to modify or change the legal effect of this deed. “ 6. That S. H. Leavell did fail to make said sale, and returned said deed in December, 1888, to J. B. Leavell. “7. That S. Lapowski bought said lot at the execution sale on the -— day of-, on a judgment rendered in the County Court of Taylor : County, Texas, in the case of Mahoney & Evans v. S. & J. Lapowski, in which said S. & J. Lapowski recovered judgment over against S. II. Leavell. That at the time of said sale J. B. Leavell was in the possession of the property in controversy in this suit. “8. That the Fort Scott Foundry and Machine Works obtained a judgment against Leavell and Swan and S. II. Leavell in Justice Court, Precinct No. 1, Taylor County, on March 4, 1889. That at the time of sale said J. B. Leavell was in the possession of this property. “9. That this judgment was filed and recorded in the judgment record of Taylor County, March 21, 1889. “ 10. That lot 1, block 13, was levied on and sold under this said judgment on the-day of May, 1889, at which sale S. Lapowski became the purchaser for the consideration of $20, and for which lot, under each of said execution sales, said S. Lapowski has proper deeds.” Then follows a statement of facts relating to the history of and the amount due upon the notes secured by the deed of the 30th of August, 1886, clearly showing the same to have been a security for a debt, in which is found the additional statement that at the date of said instrument said J. B. Leavell was put in possession of said property by S. H. Leavell, and has remained in possession ever since. Upon this statement of facts the trial court concluded that the conveyance from S. H. to J. B. Leavell was a mortgage, and that, before appellant could deprive J. B. Leavell of the possession of the property, he would have to pay the amount secured by said mortgage, and entered judgment accordingly, foreclosing the mortgage lien in favor of J. B. Leavell, with the right adjudged to appellant of paying the same off and recovering the possession of the property, from which judgment this appeal is prosecuted. The first and second assignments of error assert the proposition that the conveyance from S. II. to J. B. Leavell was not a mortgage; but under the agreed statement of facts we can not so construe it, as it was clearly given to secure' a subsisting debt. The remaining assignments assert, in different forms, the proposition that the conveyance from J. B. to S. H. Leavell, notwithstanding the verbal agreement and understanding to the contrary, took effect upon the delivery of the deed as an absolute conveyance of all the right and interest of J. B. Leavell in the property, whether as vendee or mortgagee, and that the subsequent return of said deed to him did not have the effect of reinstating his prior rights. It seems to be well settled, that a deed can not be delivered to the grantee as an escrow to take effect on a condition not appearing on its face. Heffron v. Cunningham, 76 Texas, 312; Lott v. Kaiser, 61 Texas, 665; Walker v. Renfro, 26 Texas, 142; And. Law Die., 413; 6 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 858, and cases cited in note. It is also held, that a voluntary surrender or cancellation of a deed will not operate as a retransfer of the title; but the cases are conflicting as to whether such voluntary surrender or cancellation of an unregistered deed will estop the grantee and those subsequently claiming under him. Dev. on Deeds, secs. 303-305. We have not been cited to any case in this State in which this doctrine of estoppel is directly affirmed or denied. In the case of Van Hook v. Simmons, 25 Texas Supplement, 324, it is held, that a parol agreement between the grantor and the grantee to destroy the deed of conveyance from the former to the latter, and to take back the land, would not destroy the effect of such conveyance and divest the estate of the latter, in the absence of proof of the actual destruction of the deed. It is expressly stated, in the opinion by Chief Justice Wheeler, that it was not necessary in that case to consider in what cases the cancellation of the deed would have effect and operate in the nature of a surrender to divest the estate. In Stanley v. Epperson, 45 Texas, 654, in an opinion delivered by Moore, Associate Justice, this doctrine of estoppel was applied to a case where, by permission of all parties to the deed, the title was attempted to be conveyed from the grantee to a third party by an erasure of the grantee’s name and the substitution of that of the third party. While the weight of authority seems to be against the doctrine, it is well settled in Massachusetts and a few other States; and in that opinion of Judge Moore the case of Commonwealth v. Dudley, 10 Massachusetts, 430, is referred to with approval. If, therefore, the rule governing the conveyance of title to land should be deemed applicable to the mere release of the lien (which we do not decide), we would be inclined to adopt the principle announced in Stanley v. Epperson as applicable here, and to hold, that S. H. Leavell would be estopped from recovering the possession of the property in controversy after the voluntary surrender of the deed; and that appellant would likewise be estopped, as he would occupy no better position than S. H. Leavell, all his right having been acquired subsequent to the surrender of said deed, without showing any facts that would entitle him to occupy a superior position by virtue of the rights of an execution creditor, secured without notice, or of a bona fide purchaser. We are of the opinion, however, that a decision of this question is not essential to a proper determination of the issues involved in this appeal. Although the question was not raised in the court below, and is not raised here, still' it is so obvious that we could not reverse and render a judgment for appellant on account of the deficiency in his pleading, that we must hold that no other judgment could properly have been rendered by the trial court than was rendered. His petition followed the statutory form in suits of this character, and contained nothing more. Appellee J. B. Leavell, by way of defense and cross-action, set up his debt and mortgage against S. H. Leavell and prayed a foreclosure, as he was bound to do in order to obtain that relief in this suit. Bosse v. Johnson, 73 Texas, 608. In answer to this, S. H. Leavell filed only a general denial, and appellant made no reply whatever. The case therefore comes clearly within the rule, that in an action of trespass to try title, where the defendant pleads specially his title and asks for affirmative relief, and plaintiff has matter' in avoidance, the proof of it will not be admitted, and if admitted, will not authorize a recovery by virtue thereof in the absence of its being alleged in his pleading.

Appeal from Taylor. Tried below before Hon. T. H. Conner. Cockrell & Cockrell for appellant. 1. The court erred in rendering a decree foreclosing the alleged mortgage in favor of J. B. Leavell, because the agreed statement of facts shows that said alleged mortgage was in fact a conditional sale, and the reconveyance of the property by J. B. Leavell to S. H. Leavell vested absolute title in the latter, and the title was in him at the time plaintiff bought at the two execution sales against S. H. Leavell. Ruffier v. Womack, 30 Texas, 332; Harvey v.

Leavell to J. B. Leavell was intended for a deed or mortgage, the effect of such deed and the subsequent warranty deed from J. B. back to S. H. Leavell was to vest in the latter the legal title to the premises in controversy; and the sale under execution against S. H. Leavell and purchase by plaintiff, after such re-conveyance to S. H. Leavell, vested in plaintiff the legal title. McAlpine v. Burnett, 23 Texas, 651; Johnson v. Newman, 43 Texas, 642; Hart v. Rust, 46 Texas, 556; Stanley v. Epperson, 45 Texas, 645; Walker v.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. There is involved in this suit the title to about 3000 acres of valuable land situated in Cooke County. One J. W. Wilson is the common source of title. The land was first levied on and sold under execution against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, J. W. Wilson, and others, as the property of J. W. Wilson, under a judgment in favor of Thomas Trammell & Co. Appellees, W. E. Cobb and J. J. Lang, claim under this judgment, levy, and sale. Appellants claim under a judgment lien and a subsequent levy and sale thereunder, against, substantially the same parties. This judgment was obtained by appellant the First National Bank of Austin, and the abstract thereof was recorded in Cooke County subsequent to the levy and prior to the sale under which appellees claim. There was a trial without a jury, and as the court’s conclusions of fact contained in the record cover all the material issues of fact and are sustained by the statement of facts, we here adopt them as our conclusions of fact in this case. Appellant’s first assignment of error presents the question, whether the record of the abstract of the judgment in favor of the First National Bank of Austin is sufficient to create a lien, on account of the manner in which the name of said bank was indexed. The name seems to have been written in the alphabetical index kept by the clerk for that purpose under the name “Plaintiff,” and under the letter “B,” as follows: “Bank, First National, of Austin.” The court below held this to be insufficient. He, however, found as a fact that the judgment had been indexed. The statute makes the indexing of the names of both plaintiffs and defendants essential to the creation of a lien, but does not prescribe exactly how this shall be done. Mr. Black, in his work on Judgments, section 406, lays it down as the purport of decisions, that “ a sufficient degree of accuracy is attained in such indexing if an intending purchaser (for example), exercising a reasonable degree of care and a reasonable degree of intelligence in making a search, could not fail to be apprised of the existence and character of the judgment.” We are, however, cited to no case directly in point, and have been unable to find any; and as the question is one of importance, and not necessary, as we think, to the disposition of this appeal, we leave it undecided. The second, third, and ninth assignments of error, submitted together by appellant, attack the levy and sale under which appellees deraign title, because of the issuance at the same time of executions to Wise, Cooke, Wichita, Archer, Baylor, and Wilbarger Counties, and because of certain levies made under these executions subsequent to the levy in question. We are of opinion that the matters complained of by these assignments were but irregularities, which did not render the levy and sale void; and that inasmuch as the court found that they did not tend to depreciate the price of the property sold, they would not constitute sufficient ground to set aside the sale, especially after the lapse of more than four years. Freem. on Ex., secs. 49, 50; Railway v. Morris, 67 Texas, 692; Earle v. Thomas, 14 Texas, 583. We also conclude that the proposition asserted in said assignments, that the judgment must be held satisfied because of these subsequent levies, under the facts disclosed by the record and found by the court below, can not be sustained. We are of opinion that the inconclusive circumstances relied upon to show a satisfaction of this judgment were not sufficient to require a finding that it had been satisfied in full at the time of the sale, and hence that the sale was void. Freem. on Ex., sec. 269. The twelfth assignment insists that the purchase by appellees at a trustee’s sale under the deed of trust in favor of Gregory, Cooley & Co. (which deed of trust was held to be void), amounted to an abandonment of their title under the execution sale. Our conclusion upon this assignment is, that the purchase at the trustee’s sale, being in compromise of the litigation about the validity of the deed of trust, was intended to strengthen and did not have the effect to destroy the title already acquired. The fifth assignment of error pronounces the execution sale void because the sheriff who executed the writ was brother-in-law to one of the defendants therein, to-wit, D. H. Phillips. In the absence of a statute declaring such a disqualification, we conclude that the act of the sheriff was not as if done without any official authority and hence void. For a review of the authorities on this question, see Barker v. Renick, 43 New Hampshire, 235; see also Mechem on Public Officers, sections 518, 524. It follows from these conclusions, that appellants did not acquire by their purchase under a subsequent execution sale under a judgment lien which, if valid, was subsequent to the execution lien under which appellees claim, a superior title to that of appellees; and therefore that appellants can not recover the property in controversy. They contend, however, if not entitled to this relief, that appellees should be decreed to hold the land in trust for appellant bank, and that equitable relief be granted. This prayer is not accompanied by any offer to do equity; and we are of opinion, that in view of the delay in bringing this suit and of the changed condition of the parties interested, under the facts found by the learned judge, the vacation of the execution sale under which appellees deraign title would be manifestly inequitable, and that no error was committed in refusing equitable relief. Freem. on Ex., sec. 307a. This disposes of all the other assignments of error. The judgment will therefore be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 24, 1893. A motion for rehearing was overruled.","J. T. Brackenridge et al. v. W. E. Cobb et al. No. 76. 1. Execution Sale — Simultaneous Issuance of Executions to Different Counties.—Executions issued to different counties at same time and on the same judgment. Under one of these the levy and sale in question was made, and levies subsequent to the first levy were made under the others. Held, that such irregularity did not render the levy and sale in question void; and these matters not appearing to have depreciated the price of the property sold, did not afford ground for setting aside the sale after the lapse of more than four years. 2. Same— Purchase at Execution Sale not Abandoned by Subsequent Purchase.—The purchaser at an execution sale does not abandon his title thereunder by subsequently buying the land under a void deed of trust made by the defendant in the execution, where the latter purchase was in compromise of litigation aboutthe validity of the deed of trust, and was intended to strengthen the title already acquired. 3. Same—Sheriff not Disqualified by Relationship, When.—A sale under execution is not void because the sheriff making the levy and sale is a brother-in-law to one of the defendants in the execution. 4. Same — Equitable Relief Against Execution Sale Denied, When.—Purchasers under a junior judgment are not entitled to equitable relief against a prior and valid execution sale of the property, where they have delayed more than four years in bringing suit, and do not offer to do equity by tendering the purchase money and expenses paid by the prior purchaser. Appeal from Cooke. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. The conclusions of fact found by the trial court, and adopted in the opinion rendered on this appeal, are as follows: “ 1. That on October 9, 1885, the First National Bank of Austin, of which plaintiff is president, recovered in the District Court of Travis County a judgment for $13,071.12, besides costs and interest, against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, J. W. Wilson, John H. Stone, J. W. Sacra, H. Hulen, D. H. Phillips, T. M. Rolls, and F. J. Hall, upon a note dated December 4, 1884, executed by said defendants and S. A. McAdams* “ 2. That an execution was issued on said judgment within less than twelve months after its rendition, directed to the sheriff or any constable of Travis County, and that the same was returned, not executed, because no property found. “ 3. That an alias execution issued upon said judgment October 12, 1889, directed to the sheriff or any constable of Cooke County, which was on the 31st of October, 1889, levied on the lands in controversy, as the property of J. W. Wilson, and the same were sold under said execution to plaintiff for the sum of $137, and for which said sheriff executed to-plaintiff a deed on December 3, 1889. “ 4. That afterwards, on March 8, 1890, another execution issued on said judgment, directed to the sheriff or any constable of Cooke County, which was levied upon said lands on March 10, 1890, as the property of said J. W. Wilson; and upon the first Tuesday in April, 1890, the same were sold under said execution and levy to said J. T. Brackenridge for $45, and upon the same day of said sale said sheriff executed and delivered to said Brackenridge a deed to said lands. At both of said sales Brackenridge purchased for the benefit of the bank, and took the deeds in Ms own name as a matter of convenience. “ 5. An abstract of said judgment was filed for record, and recorded in the judgment record of Cooke County, on October 10, 1885, and was-also indexed in the index to said record. “ 6. That on the 4th clay of April, 1885, J. W. Wilson executed to C. R. Smith, trustee, a deed of trust upon about 6000 acres of land, including the lands in controversy, purporting to be made to secure a note for $43,000, of that date, executed by said Wilson to Gregory, Cooley & Co. Said deed of trust was duly recorded in the mortgage record of Cooke County on same day it was executed. “ 7. That on August 28, 1885, in the District Court of Wise County, Thomas Trammell & Co. recovered judgment for the sum of $8924.70, with interest and costs, against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, J. W. Wilson, John H. Stone, F. J. Hall, H. Hulen, J. W. Sacra, Phillips, Rolls & Co. (a firm composed of D. H. Phillips, J. M. Rolls, Richard McCubbin, S. A. McAdams, and Isaac Cloud), W. E. Cobb, and the Ritchey-Gooch Live Stock Company. Said judgment recites that the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company was the principal, and that said J. W. Wilson, John H. Stone, F. J. Hall, H. Hulen, J. W. Sacra, and Phillips, Rolls & Co. were sureties, and that W. E. Cobb and the Ritchey-Gooch Live Stock Company were endorsers, upon the note on which judgment was obtained; and it directed that execution upon said judgment issue; first, against the property of the principal; second, against the property of the sureties; and third, against the property of the endorsers. “ 8. That on the 28th day of September, 1885, the clerk of the District Court of Wise County, acting under instructions of the attorneys of Thomas Trammell & Co., issued six executions upon the judgment mentioned in the next preceding section of these conclusions, viz., one to Wise, one to Cooke, one to Wichita, one to Baylor, one to Archer, and one to Wilbarger County. Said executions were issued in the order above named; that is, first to Wise, next to Cooke, next to Wichita, next to Baylor, next to Archer, and next to Wilbarger. The execution to Wise described the defendants as the ‘ Stone Cattle and Pasture Company et al.,’ and commanded the sheriff to make the amount of the judgment out of the 1 Stone Cattle and Pasture Company et al.’ It did not state when it was returnable, and the sheriff’s return was to the effect that it came to hand on the same day issued, and was returned on the same day, 1 No property found in Wise County, owned by the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, subject to execution.’ “9. The execution to Cooke was returnable within sixty days, and commanded the sheriff, ‘ of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, as principal, and J. W. Wilson, John H. Stone, E. J. Hall, H. Hulen, J. W. Sacra, Phillips, Rolls & Co. (a firm composed of D. H. Phillips, J. M. Rolls, Richard McCubbin, S. A. McAdams, and Isaac Cloud), as sureties, and W. E. Cobb and the RicheyG-ooch Live Stock Company, as endorsers,’ to make the amount of said judgment. It mentioned the issuance of execution to Wise County, but did not mention the issuance of the other executions on same day. This execution was placed in the hands of A. M. Hill, sheriff of Cooke County, on September 29, 1885, and was levied on the same day upon all the lands described in the deed of trust from J. W. Wilson to C. R. Smith, mentioned in section 6 of these conclusions; and on the first Tuesday in November, 1885, said sheriff, by virtue of said execution and levy, sold said lands, in lots and parcels, to W. E. Cobb & Co., for prices aggregating 836; and said W. E. Cobb & Co. having complied with their bids, said sheriff, on December 21, 1885, executed, acknowledged, and delivered to said W. E. Cobb & Co. a deed to said lands, but which deed was not filed for record in Cooke County until the 17th day of April, 1886. “ 10. That the execution to Wichita County was precisely like the one to Cooke, and was placed in the hands of the sheriff of Wichita County on the 1st day of October, 1885, and was levied on the same day on certain brands of cattle, as the property of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, as they ran upon the range, and by range levy; also upon the fence and fence posts around the pasture of said company; and also upon 60,000 acres of land in said county, as the property of said Stone Cattle and Pasture Company. The sheriff’s return stated that this execution is returned for want of time for sale, but this return is not dated. The execution to Archer is precisely like the one to Cooke, and was placed in the hands of the sheriff of Archer County on October 1, 1885, and on the following day was levied upon personal property of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, subject to a prior levy in favor of J. J. Lang; the return upon said execution showing that the sale of the property did not satisfy Lang’s execution. The return further states that it was again levied, on the 16th day of October, 1885, upon some real estate, as the property of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, and the same was advertised to be sold on the first Tuesday in December, 1885, but that the sheriff was afterwards instructed by W. E. Cobb’s attorneys to release the levy and return the execution. The execution to Wilbarger was like the one to Cooke, and was placed in the hands of the sheriff of Wilbarger County on October 1, 1885, but the return does not show that anything was ever done with it. The execution to Baylor County was like the one to Cooke, and was endorsed, ‘ Returned by order of plaintiff’s attorneys,’ viz., Cowan & Perry. “ 11. That the deed of trust executed by J. W. Wilson to C. R. Smith on April 4, 1885, to secure Gregory, Cooley & Co. in the payment of said $43,000 note, was fraudulent and void as to creditors. “ 12. That on May 4, 1886, W. E. Cobb & Co. instituted suit in the District Court of Cooke County against Gregory, Cooley & Co., C. R. Smith, and J. W. Wilson, to recover the lands described in the trust deed from J. W. Wilson to C. R. Smith, and which had been purchased by W. E. Cobb & Co. at the sale under the execution issued on the judgment in favor of Thomas Trammell & Co. against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, recovered in District Court of Wise County August 28, 1885, alleging that said deed of trust from Wilson to Smith was fraudulent, and praying an injunction, which was granted, prohibiting said Smith, who had advertised said lands for sale under said deed of trust, from selling the same. “ 13. That W. E. Cobb & Co. was a partnership composed of W. E. Cobb and the Ritchey-Gooch Live Stock Company, and that after the execution in favor of Thomas Trammell & Co. against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, issued upon the judgment recovered in Wise County, August 28, 1885, and was levied upon the lands described in the trust deed from Wilson to Smith, but before the sale under said execution, said W. E. Cobb &-Co. paid off said judgment to save themselves, because they were liable as endorsers on the note upon which said judgment was rendered, and thereby became the owners of said judgment; and that afterwards the Ritchey-Gooch Live Stock Company sold to defendant J. J. Lang its interest in said judgment, and the lands sold thereunder, for which said Lang paid to the Ritchey-Gooch Live Stock Company the sum of 84500. “ 14. That afterwards, on the 17th day of February, 1887, W. E. Cobb & Co., J. J. Lang, Gregory, Cooley & Co., and J. W. Wilson entered into a written agreement whereby the suit instituted by W. E. Cobb & Co. against Gregory, Cooley & Co., C. R. Smith, and J. W. Wilson was compromised; said agreement providing that W. E. Cobb & Co. should dismiss their suit, and that C. R. Smith should proceed to sell said lands under said deed of trust, and that at said sale Gregory, Cooley & Co., W. E. Cobb & Co., and J. J. Lang would purchase said land, if it did not bring more than 850,000, and divide the same between them as follows: viz., said Lang and W. E. Cobb & Co. should have 3032 acres, and Gregory, Cooley & Co. should have 2900 acres; and that should said land be bought by some other person, the money paid for same should be divided between W. E. Cobb & Co., J. J. Lang, and Gregory, Cooley & Co. in the proportion abOAre mentioned. Said agreement also stipulated that W. E. Cobb & Co. and J. J. Lang should release said J. W. Wilson from various debts they had against him, amounting in the aggregate to more than 860,000. In pursuance of this agreement, said land was sold under said deed of trust on March 17, 1887, and purchased and divided as therein contemplated; the lands in controversy being the portion deeded to defendants in said division. “15. That afterwards, in 1887, the defendants instituted suit in the District Court of Baylor County against W. F. Somerville et al., claiming in said suit that the judgment in favor of Thomas Trammell & Co. against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company et al., recovered in the District Court of Wise County on August 28, 1885, was a lien on 70 sections of land in said county belonging to the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, subject to the lien of a judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank against said company, under which said lands had been sold and bought by W. F. Somerville et al., and praying that said sale be set aside on account of irregularities, inadequacy of price, etc. This suit terminated during the year 1889 in favor of plaintiffs therein. Said sale was set aside, and a resale of the land ordered; and out of this, by way of compromise with the parties, the plaintiffs in said suit recovered one-third interest in said 70 sections of land; said lands being school sections, and are encumbered, for purchase money due the State, at the rate of one dollar per acre for the dry, and two dollars per acre for the watered sections. “ 16. That A. M. Hill, the sheriff who sold the land under the execution in favor of Thomas Trammell & Co. against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company et al., at which sale W. E. Cobb & Co. became the purchasers, was a brother-in-law of D. H. Phillips, one of the defendants in said execution. “ 17. That when W. E. Cobb & Co. purchased the lands in controversy at the execution sale on the first Tuesday in November, 1885, neither they nor their attorney, who attended said sale, and bid in said lands for them, had any knowledge that the trust deed executed by J. W. Wilson to C. R. Smith was fraudulent; that under the circumstances attending said sale, the price paid by W. E. Cobb & Co. was not inadequate; that the irregularities herein before referred to did not in any manner conduce to the small price for which said lands sold; that said W. E. Cobb & Co. acted in perfect good faith in the purchase of said lands, and were not in any manner responsible for the irregularities referred to, -or for the small price for which said lands sold; that the fact of said deed of trust upon said lands being of record, and for an apparently valid debt, was the real cause of the small price for which said lands sold. “ 18. That said lands, at the date of said sale, were worth eight or ten dollars per acre; and on the 4th day of April, 1885, when Wilson executed said deed of trust to C. R. Smith, he was insolvent, and has ever since been so. “ 19. That defendants Cobb and Lang, on June 24, 1887, borrowed of the Texas Loan Agency $16,000, and secured the same by deed of trust upon the lands in controversy, and that said loan agency is an innocent purchaser, as alleged in plaintiff’s petition. “ 20. That while the deed of trust from J. W. Wilson to C. R. Smith was fraudulent as to creditors, J. W. Wilson nevertheless owed Gregory, Cooley & Co. a large amount of money; and, in the compromise with Gregory, Cooley & Co., defendants acted in good faith, believed they were securing a perfect title to the portion of the land they got, and so believed when they mortgaged the same to the Texas Loan Agency. “21. That defendants have had to incur an expense of two thousand dollars, including their attorneys’ fees, in the prosecution of the suit instituted by W. E. Cobb & Co. against Gregory, Cooley & Co., C. R. Smith, and J. W. Wilson.” Davis & Harris, for appellants. 1. The court erred in holding that the abstract of the judgment of the District Court of Travis County in favor of the First National Bank of Austin against the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, J. W. Wilson, et al., through which the plaintiffs claim, was not indexed so as to create a lien upon the lands in controversy, and in holding that said abstract was not so recorded and indexed as to give the said First National Bank of Austin a lien upon said lands.

Koertge, 70 Texas, 162; Bennett on Lis Pendens, sec. 119; Freem. on Judg., sec. 347. 2. The suing out of the five executions from the District Court of ■ Wise County upon the judgment in favor of Thomas Trammell & Co., one being to Cooke, one to Wichita, one to Archer, one to. Baylor, and one to Wilbarger County, and the attempt to enforce all of said executions at one and the same time, rendered the execution to Cooke County and the proceedings thereunder fraudulent and void as to the other creditors of said J. W. Wilson. Rice v. Miller, 70 Texas, 615; Freem. on Ex., secs. 206-209, 270; Brandt on Surety., sec. 378; Moss v. Pettingill, 3 Minn., 217. 3. A. M. Hill, the sheriff of Cooke County, being the brother-in-law of one of the defendants in the execution in favor of Thomas Trammell & Co., issued from the District Court of Wise County, was disqualified for executing the same, and the sale by the said Hill thereunder was therefore void.

The court erred in not holding that W. E. Cobb & Co., at their execution sale, bought subject to an apparent encumbrance of 843,000 in favor of Gregory, Cooley & Co., and for a merely nominal consideration, and that as against the other creditors of J. W, Wilson,° who was insolvent, they could not hold the land freed of the encumbrances. 3 Pome. Eq., sec. 1205; 2 Jones on Mort., sec. 768; 2 Bige. on Fraud, 423; Martin v. Ranlett, 57 Am.

Dec., 226. 6. The pretended sale by Smith under the fraudulent deed of trust to secure Gregory, Cooley & Co., pending the injunction restraining the same and the suit to cancel the same, was fraudulent and void as to the other creditors of J. W. Wilson; and Cobb and Lang being concerned in said sale, and having aided to cover up and conceal the property of said Wilson, and having elected to abandon their suit and take under the fraudulent deed of trust, thereby abandoned the. sheriff’s sale, and the court erred in not so holding.

If the abstract of the judgment of the First National Bank of Austin was recorded in such a manner as to create a lien on the land in controversy, the same could not avail appellants, because, before the record of such abstract, the execution on the Thos.

The issuing of more than one execution at the same time on a judgment does not render the execution void, and is but an irregularity that can not avail the appellants in a collateral attack upon the execution sale, because the suit is brought too late, and not in the proper court.

All the testimony shows that the price bid at the execution sale by Cobb & Co. for the land was a fair price under the condition of the title, and for which condition appellees were not to blame.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. The land in controversy was patented to the heirs of Anthony Bates, and appellants brought this suit as plaintiffs in the court below, claiming as the heirs of said Bates, in trespass to try title against appellees, the Virginia Ranch, Land, and Cattle Company, Isaac McConnell,’ and R. C. McConnell, as defendants. One W. C. Powell appeared and made himself a party defendant as warrantor of the said cattle company, and pleaded over against the defendant Isaac McConnell and one Henry Warren as his warrantors. Warren answered, and pleaded over against the said McConnell as his warrantor. The defendants claimed under several deeds and written 'instruments, claimed to have been executed by deceased ancestors of plaintiffs, and also under verbal locative contracts claimed to have been made by them; and during the trial the defendant Isaac McConnell was used as a witness to prove the execution of the several instruments above referred to, and also the locative contracts. Plaintiffs objected to this witness testifying, on the ground that he was a party to the suit, and could not testify to transactions with their deceased ancestors,' under our statute. To remedy this objection the said McConnell was permitted, after plaintiffs had closed their evidence, to file a disclaimer of all interest in the land in controversy, and the defendant Powell withdrew his pleading seeking to recover over against the said McConnell as his warrantor; but no order was made with reference to the plea of Henry Warren seeking to recover over against said witness. After these proceedings McConnell was again permitted to testify to substantially the same facts as in his former testimony, and to prove verbal authority from some of the deceased ancestors of plaintiffs to him to locate the certificate by virtue of which the land was patented, and other land certificates, and to give a part of the land to have this done. Appellants objected to this witness testifying to these facts, upon the same grounds urged to his evidence in the first instance. The court, however, overruled these objections, and a number of appellants’ assignments of error are directed to calling in question the correctness of this ruling. We are of the opinion the court erred in admitting this evidence. Notwithstanding the disclaimer filed by this witness, and the dismissal by the defendant Powell of his plea over against him, we think it can hardly be questioned that the judgment rendered upon this trial would be conclusive against said McConnell in any subsequent suits that might be brought by those claiming under him to recover upon his covenant of warranty; and especially would it be so conclusive against him in favor of the defendant Warren, who had never dismissed his pleading against him. Brown v. Hearon, 66 Texas, 64; Kirby v. Estill, 75 Texas, 485. Treating, then, the witness Isaac McConnell as such a party to this suit as would be bound by the judgment rendered therein, so as to fix this liability upon his covenants of warranty, we think there can be but little doubt that he was such a party to the proceeding as would prohibit him, under our statute, from testifying to transactions with the deceased ancestors of plaintiffs, who claimed as their heirs. Mr. Abbott, in his work on Trial Evidence, page 63, in treating of witnesses who are allowed to testify against executors and administrators, under statutes similar to ours, says: “ No person can be thus examined in his own behalf or interest, or in behalf of a party succeeding to his title or interest, if he or his predecessor in interest is, at the time of the trial, interested in the event of the action or proceeding, whether directly interested in the cause of action, or whether merely liable to be legally affected by the judgment; as, for instance, where he stands in such a position that the effect of a recovery in the action might be to diminish a fund in which he has an interest, or may aid the party unsuccessful in the action to bring and maintain an action against the witness for indemnity.” And again, on page 64: “No person from, through, or under whom such a party or interested person derives his interest or title, by assignment or othewise, can be thus examined in his own behalf or interest, or in behalf of the party succeeding to his title or interest, if the interest or title thus derived is in the particular claim affected by the, transaction or communication.” Mr. Wharton, in the first volume of his work on the Law of Evidence,, on page 473, in treating of who are parties within the meaning of these statutes, says: “ But a real, who is not a nominal, party to the record is. excluded by the exception.” In Simpson v. Brotherton, 62 Texas, 170, our Supreme Court, upon full consideration, decided that a wife, by reason of her interest in the community property, was a party to the suit within the meaning of our statute, so as to prohibit her from testifying, although she was not a party to the record; holding that the word “ party ” in this statute was not to be given a narrow construction, but would be extended to include those really in interest, though not parties by name in proceedings; and this was reaffirmed in Newton v. Newton, 77 Texas, 510. We do not understand the decision in Markham v. Carothers, 47 Texas, 25, and in Eastham v. Roundtree, 56 Texas, 110, to the effect that a defendant who has filed a disclaimer and is thenceforth treated as not being a party to the cause, is a competent witness, as being in conflict with the views here expressed. We therefore hold that where a warrantor has been made a party to the suit in such a way as to render the judgment binding upon him in favor of his vendees, he is a party thereto within the meaning of our statute which prohibits parties from testifying against the heirs or legal representatives of decedents. No attempt was made to introduce the several deeds referred to above as ancient instruments. The defendants relied entirely upon proving their execution by the witness McConnell. Ikard v. Thompson, 81 Texas, 291. Appellants also strenuously insist that the verbal locative contracts, in so far as they were made or authorized by married women, would be void, because not acknowledged in compliance with our statute regulating the conveyance by a married woman of her separate property; but we are of the opinion that this position is not well taken. This question has recently been very thoroughly considered by our Supreme Court in the case of Ikard v. Thompson, cited above, and the conclusion reached, that a married woman can make contracts to acquire land by the location of a land certificate, which is her separate property, without acknowledging the same in the manner required for the conveyance of her real estate; and as to the correctness of this decision we do not entertain a.ny question. Aycock v. Kimbrough, 71 Texas. 330; Lecomte v. Toudouze, 82 Texas, 213. The language used in the sixth special finding ""by the court below is susceptible to the construction that the court was of opinion that one tenant would have implied authority from his cotenant to contract to give a part of the land for the location of the certificate, and subdivision fourth of appellant’s eighth assignment calls in question this view of the law. We do not understand that the court below based its decision upon this ground, it having in the same connection found that McConnell had express authority from his cotenants to make such a contract. In Stone v. Ellis, 69 Texas, 325, it is expressly decided that one heir has no such implied authority from the other heirs. Also see Grimes v. Smith, 70 Texas, 217, and Sypert v. McCowen, 28 Texas, 640. In rendering its judgment the court below allowed the defendant to retain the interest of R. C. McConnell in the land in controversy, he having previously filed a disclaimer as one of the parties to the suit. We think this action of the court was correct. While one tenant in common ■can recover from a stranger the whole property, he can only recover from Ms cotenant in possession the interest which he really owns. If the court upon another trial should find that the Virginia Ranch, Land, and Cattle Company is the owner of an undivided interest with plaintiffs in the land in controversy, then plaintiffs could not dispossess it, and would only be entitled to a decree establishing their respective interests in the land. Boone v. Knox, 80 Texas, 643. It seems that in making the deed to Henry Warren for his locative interest in the land, Isaac McConnell purported to convey in his own name and not as agent for the heirs of Anthony Bates; and appellants contend that such conveyance would not affect the interest of such heirs, even though McConnell might have been their agent, with authority to make the same. In common law courts there would be much in this objection, but as our courts have the power to look to equitable as well as legal titles, the tendency of our decisions has been to hold that such a conveyance would pass whatever right the person making it had to convey, whether it be signed as agent or principal. Rogers v. Bracken, 15 Texas, 564; Daughtrey v. Knolle, 44 Texas, 450; Hough v. Hill, 47 Texas, 153. Delivered November 15, 1892. Appellant’s seventeenth assignment calls in question the action of the court in failing to allow him rent for any part of the land. Before one tenant can make his cotenant liable to him for the use of the common property, he must show that he has been refused joint occupancy, and this does not seem to have been attempted in this case. Neil v. Shackelford, 45 Texas, 119; Osborn v. Osborn, 62 Texas, 495; Akin v. Jefferson, 65 Texas, 142. Appellant’s remaining assignments of error are directed to calling in question the sufficiency of the evidence to support certain findings of the court, but as the cause will have to be remanded, we have thought it best to express no opinion thereon. For the error of the court in permitting-the witness McConnell to testify, as indicated in the first part of this opinion, let the judgment of the court below be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance herewith.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. Appellant prosecutes this appeal from a judgment rendered by the District Court of Grayson County in favor of appellee. The suit is for damages on account of personal injuries sustained by the appellee. On February 12, 1889, appellee was in the employ, as an engineer, of H. C. Cross and Geo. A. Eddy, receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company. He was operating a freight train of nineteen cars on the line or track of railway between Whitesboro, in Grayson County, and Fort Worth, in Tarrant County. This line of railway was the property of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company. By an arrangement .between this company and the receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company, the precise character of which is not disclosed by the record, this line of railway, while exclusively owned by the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, was jointly used by the latter company and the receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company. The trains of the receivers, while on the joint track, were, by virtue of the arrangement referred to, operated under the orders of W. S. Polhemus, dispatcher and superintendent of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company. The appellee, on the day named, in charge of the train of the receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company, as already stated, had received orders from Mr. Polhemus to meet the Texas & Pacific train at Mingo, a station in Den-ton County, between the towns of Pilot Point and Denton. The engineer operating the latter train had likewise received orders to meet the Missouri, Kansas & Texas train operated by appellee at Mingo. The engineer in charge of the Texas & Pacific train violated the orders received by him, and hence, at a point about four miles north of Mingo, without fault on the part of the appellee, and in spite of a diligent effort by him to avoid the catastrophe, and on account of the negligence of the engineer of the Texas & Pacific train, the trains collided, seriously injuring the appellee. We are unable to approve the proposition of appellant, that under the facts above recited, which were covered by the allegations in plaintiff’s petition, the appellee and the employe on appellant’s train to whose negligence the injuries in question are to be ascribed, were fellow servants. The relation of fellow servant imports that the persons affected shall be 11 engaged in the employment of the same master, in the performance of a common work, and in the discharge of duties having in view the same general purpose.” We do not think, under the facts stated, that the engineer of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company was a fellow servant with the employe of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, so as to prevent a recovery bjr him for injuries due to their negligence, though a joint track was used by the two companies. The fact that the plaintiff was subject to the orders 'of his masters, the receivers, and by virtue-thereof to the control of the superintendent or dispatcher of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, indicates that such superintendent was, pro hac vice, the representative of the receivers, rather than that the plaintiff was the servant of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company. The appellant, in support of the proposition referred to, cites the cases of Railway v. Dorsey, 66 Texas, 148, and Railway v. Jones, 75 Texas, 151. We think both these cases clearly distinguishable from the present case. There the plaintiff was engaged in the general service of both the railway companies involved. Here the plaintiff was the servant only of the receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company. While the track on which appellee was operating the train of the receivers was jointly used by them and the appellant, the plaintiff was in no sense the servant of appellant. No contract, express or implied, was shown to exist by which, as a servant, he owed it any duty whatever. He was held to obey the orders of the train dispatcher of the appellant, not because the train dispatcher was the employe of the appellant, but because by arrangement between the appellant and the receivers Mr. Polhemus became their train dispatcher also. The plaintiff, in receiving orders-from the train dispatcher mentioned, is presumed to have been acting in obedience to the commands of the receivers, between whom and himself alone a contractual relation is shown to have existed. The plaintiff’s petition charges the negligence to which his injuries are ascribed as the negligence of “the defendant, the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, its agents and employes,” without specifying the particular agent or employe guilty of the negligence causing the misfortune, and without stating the specific act of negligence complained of. The appellant complains of the action of the court in overruling the special exception addressed, on account of the omission stated, to the plaintiff’s petition. The facts alleged in the petition justif,y the inference that the-accident described was due to the negligence of the defendant. The evidence developed on the trial showed that this negligence was to be ascribed to the engineer in charge of the defendant’s train. This fact, however, the defendant, in framing his petition, could not be supposed to know. It was, on the contrary, a fact peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. This peculiar knowledge, together with the absence of information on the part of plaintiff as to the special source of the injuries complained of, is, we think, naturally to be inferred from the averments of the petition. Under such circumstances, the pleader is not held to the specific averments, the absence of which appellant complains of. Railway v. Smith, 74 Texas, 276. The circumstances attendant upon the accident were sufficiently described in the petition to apprise the appellant of the negligence with which it was charged, and of the source thereof, to enable appellant to prepare its defense. Appellant complains of the following paragraph of the court’s charge: “And if you further believe that such collision was occasioned by the negligence of any of the agents, servants, or employes of the defendant, the Texas & Pacific Eailway Company—that is, if you believe that by the use of ordinary care and caution by any agent, servant, or employe of the defendant, the Texas & Pacific Eailway Company, then in charge of the train of the defendant, the Texas & Pacific Eailway Company, such collision could have been avoided—you will return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.” Appellant objects to this charge, on the ground that it “ embraces negligence on the part of any or all of the servants” of the company operating the train occasioning the collision, whereas it should have been confined to the negligence of the engineer who, under the undisputed testimony, was responsible for the accident. The instruction was framed in conformity with the allegations of the petition. If it was not limited to the particular employe shown by the evidence to have been guilty of negligence, and if for that reason it be erroneous, we do not think that, as there is no conflict in the evidence, with reference to the negligence of the engineer, it could possibly have been detrimental to appellant. Having thus disposed of all the questions raised in appellant’s brief, we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed. It is so ordered. Affirmed Delivered February 23, 1893. Justice Head did not sit in this case. A motion for rehearing was overruled.","Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. W. M. Easton. No. 96. 1. Fellow Servants — Railway Companies Using Joint Track.— In a suit against a railway company for personal injuries, it appeared that the plaintiff was an engineer in the service of another railway company which jointly used a certain track of the defendant company; that all trains when on such joint track were under orders of the defendant's train dispatcher; that plaintiff was operating his employer’s train on such joint track under directions of such dispatcher to meet one of defendant’s trains at a designated point; that the engineer of defendant’s train, in violation of his orders, ran by the meeting point, and plaintiff was injured in a collision that ensued. SeZcZ. that plaintiff and the engineer of defendant’s train were not fellow servants. 2. Same—Cases Distinguished.—Railway v. Dorsey, 66 Texas, 148, and Railway v. Jones, 75 Texas, 151, distinguished from the present case on the point ■of fellow servants. 3. Pleading—Fact Specially Known to Opposite Party.—Ah averment that the injury complained of was caused by the negligence of “ the defendant, its agents and employes,” is sufficient, without specifying the particular agent or employe guilty of the negligence, that being a fact in this case peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. 4. Charge of Court—Harmless Error.—An instruction, that if by the use of ordinary care by any of defendant's servants then in charge of defendant’s train the collision could have been avoided, they should find for plaintiff, was not to the injury of defendant where there was no conflict in the evidence that the collision resulted from the negligence of the engineer of defendant’s train.

"KEY, Associate Justice. C. Aultman & Co., a corporation, sued York and John and E. S. Kirby on three notes given for part of the purchase money for a threshing machine, sold to the defendants by Low & Low, acting as agents for plaintiff. The defenses interposed were fraudulent representations and a breach of warranty. This is the second appeal, a former judgment in favor of appelleeshaving been reversed. Aultman & Co. v. York, 71 Texas, 261. Over four years after the suit was instituted, and nearly ñve years after the sale was made, the defendants impleaded Low & Low, and averred that if the representations and contract of warranty made by them were not binding on the plaintiff, then Low & Low should respond in damages, etc. Low & Low, among other things, pleaded the two years statute of limitation; and while this plea appears to have been fully sustained by the testimony, there was a verdict in favor of the original defendants against Low & Low for $139, which, however, was remitted by the defendants before judgment. The verdict also declared that defendants were not liable on the notes sued on, and that said notes should be cancelled. The testimony clearly shows, that the only contract of warranty that Low & Low were authorized to make for the plaintiff was made; that said contract was in writing (or printed), and it was produced by defendants, and put in evidence by plaintiff. By this instrument, and this alone, was the plaintiff bound; and its terms were as obligatory upon defendants as plaintiff. Machine Co. v. Crow, 30 N. W. Rep., 609. The defendant John Kirby testified that he was induced to purchase the machine by certain verbal representations made by a member of the firm of Low & Low, and that he considered them, Low & Low, liable for all damages. Delivered November 23, 1892. It was evidently upon the theory entertained by this defendant that the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants against Low & Low for 8139, and not upon the theory of a breach of the written warranty given by appellant. If this was the theory upon which the verdict against Low & Low was rendered, then the jury, to have been consistent, should have found for appellant against appellees for the full amount of the notes sued on. If, on the other hand, the verdict was based upon a breach of appellant’s warranty, it is not supported by the testimony, because the evidence fails to show that the written notices required by the contract of warranty were given by appellees within the time required, and the question of waiver was not submitted to the jury. Appellant is entitled to judgment for the full amount of the notes sued on, unless appellees show a breach of the written contract of warranty. And to show such breach, they must show compliance on their part with those parts of the contract requiring them to give written notices, return defective parts, and that there was not continued use of the machine after the expiration of the time named in the warranty, unless it be shown that appellees’ compliance with these terms of the contract has been waived. The charge of the court did not cover all these phases of the ease as clearly and fully as it should have done. Because the verdict and judgment are not sustained by the testimony, we reverse the case. Reversed and remanded.","C. Aultman & Co. v. H. K. York et al. No. 36. 1.

Breach of Guaranty. — See facts held insufficient to show breach of guaranty in sale of a threshing machine. Appeal from Lampasas. Tried below before Hon. W. A. Blackburn. In addition to facts stated in the opinion, the record shows the warranty which Aultman & Co. authorized their agents to make to purchasers of machinery. This warranty, while not signed by the parties, was exhibited by the agents to the purchasers, and a printed copy thereof delivered to them at their purchase. The declarations of the agents as to the merits of the machinery beyond this printed guaranty, as alleged, were admitted in evidence against the agents, who were also made parties defendant. The warranty is as follows: ‘ ‘ The above machinery to be warranted to be made of good materials, and with proper use and management to do as good work as any other of its size, made for the same purpose, in the United States. If inside of five days from the day of its first use the said machinery shall fail to fill said warranty, written notice shall be given to C. Aultman & Co., Canton, Ohio, and also to the local agent from whom same was purchased, stating wherein it fails to fill the warranty, and a reasonable time allowed them to get to the machine and remedy the defect, if any there be (if it be of such nature that a remedy can not be suggested by letter), the undersigned rendering necessary and friendly assistance. If the machinery can not be made to fill the warranty, that part which fails shall be returned by the undersigned to the place where received and another furnished which shall perform the work, or money and notes which shall have been given for same to be returned and no further claim to be made on C. Aultman & Co. “It is further mutually understood and agreed that continued use of said machinery after the expiration of the time named in the above warranty shall be evidence of the fulfilment of the warranty and full satisfaction to the undersigned, who agrees thereafter to make no other claim on C. Aultman & Co.; and further, that if the above machinery or any part thereof is delivered to the undersigned before settlement is made for same as herein agreed, or any alterations or erasures are made in the above warranty, or in this special understanding and agreement, the undersigned waives all claims under warranty.” The nature of the defense made is further shown in the report on the former appeal in this case. 71 Texas, 261.

If a person who constitutes another his agent for the sale of any article of merchandise furnish him with the kind of a warranty he is to give a purchaser, a party dealing with such agent, who has knowledge that such a warranty was furnished the agent, can not accept a parol warranty from the agent different in its terms, and require the principal to comply with such parol warranty.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This is a suit by appellee, against appellants, as receivers of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway in Texas, to recover damages for injuries received by him while traveling as a passenger over a railway controlled by appellants. Appellants pleaded, that pending this suit they had been discharged from the receivership by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Texas, which appointed them, and had relinquished control of the property committed to their charge as such receivers, to the purchasers thereof. On the trial it was agreed, that the property had been by the appellants turned over to the purchasers under the foreclosure proceedings, and that the appellants, since such transfer, had ceased to have any control or management of the same. The order of the United States Circuit Court, requiring appellants to turn over the property, provided that all claims against the receivership should be established by intervention in that court, and that the bills in the cause would be retained for the purpose of investigating such liabilities, in order to have a final settlement of such receivership. No order was shown expressly discharging the receivers, and there was no agreement that such order existed, and it in no way appeared that the .accounts of the receivers had ever been acted on, and a decree entered by the court discharging them. This case, therefore, differs materially from that of the same appellants against C. H. Beecher, just decided. That ■decision was based solely upon the legal effect of the decree of the Federal Court discharging the receivers, which was admitted to exist. Here the receivers, for all the record shows, may still hold their office and be in a position to defend the suit and meet the judgment rendered. It is true it appears that they had turned over the property put in their charge to purchasers, but they are not, so far as the record shows, removed from their offices, and the Circuit Court expressly retains the bills for the purpose of adjusting their liabilities. We do not think this state of the record presents the same question as was considered in the Beecher casé, and hold therefore that appellants’ eleventh assignment of error is not well taken. The nineteenth assignment of error presents the question, whether or not the court could properly declare a lien on the property which had been in the possession of the receivers, to secure a liability incurred by them. We do not find it necessary, at this time, to decide this question, and will not do so until it has been more thoroughly argued and considered. The points raised in the seventeenth assignment of error, and propositions thereunder, were considered in the case of these appellants against Withers (1 Texas Civil Appeals, 540), and determined against appellants. Appellants’ first assignment of error complains of the admission of evidence to show that after the accident in which appellee was hurt appellants had made changes and repairs in its track. This kind of evidence is usually not admissible. Railway v. McGowan, 73 Texas, 355; Railway v. Hennessey, 75 Texas, 155; Railway v. Jones, 14 S. W. Rep., 309. In the Withers case, above referred to, this court held, that evidence there offered by plaintiff was admissible to rebut testimony of witnesses for defendants, to the effect that the road where this wreck occurred was in safe condition before and after the wreck, and had remained in the same condition both before and after the wreck. That evidence was also held admissible as tending to show the actual condition of the track when the wreck occurred. On the trial of this case plaintiff offered the objectionable evidence in chief, and not in rebuttal of the testimony of defendants’ witnesses. It can not be held to serve any legitimate purpose in establishing the condition of the road at the time of the accident, for after the witnesses had stated all facts properly admissible for that purpose, they were allowed to go further and state in detail what had been done towards improving the track. Under the rulings of our Supreme Court, this was improper, and unless the evidence should become relevant for the purpose of rebutting testimony offered by appellants, it should be excluded on another trial. The fourth assignment of error complains of the following portion of the court’s charge: “You are charged, that receivers of railway companies, as other common carriers, in the operation and management of the railway under their control, are held under the law to the greatest possible care and diligence for the safety of the passengers they undertake to carry; and while they are not insurers of absolute safety of their passengers, yet they are required to provide for their safe conveyance, as far as human care and foresight will go.” This instruction was held erroneous in the Withers case, supra. There was error in the passage of the charge on the measure of damages, wherein the jury were instructed to allow for value of time lost, there being no evidence of such value. Some of the language of appellants’ counsel was improper, and should not occur again. The court, however, rebuked the counsel, and gave the jury proper instructions on the subject. We have carefully considered all of the other assignments, and find no other material errors. The court’s definition of negligence, as copied in the second assignment, is somewhat objectionable, perhaps, but full and correct instructions were given in other parts of the charge, and in special charges given at the request of appellants. The special charges found in the seventh and eighth assignments state the law correctly, but the rules which they announce were sufficiently given, and it would have been improper for the court to repeat in so many forms the same propositions. The charge complained of- in the fifth assignment of error is correct and is applicable .to the case. The evidence left uncertain the exact cause of the wreck. It may have resulted from one defect or from the combined effect of several defects and careless running of the train. The-fact that a wreck occurred is evidence for the jury to consider, and in the absence of proof showing that it was the consequence of some particular cause, it was proper for the court to give to the jury the rules by which appellants’ whole duty to their passengers was measured, in order that they might determine whether or not there had been a neglect to perform it in any particular. For this reason appellants’ fifth special charge was-correctly refused, and their tenth qualified by the court. The charge of the court on the measure of damages, with the exception of the part above held to be erroneous, was correct. It is not properly open to the objection made in the fourteenth assignment. In regard to future damages it was not very full, and it would have been proper to give a special charge correctly stating the rules applicable, if asked. But-the special charge requested (number 5) required that the jury be “ satisfied ’’ that the apprehended results would flow from the injuries. This exacted too high a degree of proof for a civil case, and the charge was-properly refused. The errors we have pointed out are all we have found of which appellants can complain. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded„ Delivered January 12, 1893.","S. W. Fordyce and A. H. Swanson, Receivers, v. Thomas Chancey. No. 58. 1. Abatement of Suit Against Federal Receiver. —When no order of the Federal court is shown, expressly discharging the receivers, suit for damages for personal injuries, pending in the State court, will not abate, although it be shown that under foreclosure proceedings the property committed to the charge of the receivers had been sold and by them turned over to the purchasers, and that they had since that time ceased to have any control or management of it. 2. Lien on Property of Road.—We do not find it necessary to decide the question whether or not the court could declare a lien upon the property which had been in possession of the receivers. 3. Evidence—Repair of Track.—Evidence of repair of track after the accident, when offered in chief by the plaintiff and not in rebuttal of any proof made by the opposite party, is inadmissible. 4. Care and Diligence.—It is error to charge that receivers are held to the greatest possible care and diligence for the safety of their passengers, and to provide for their safe conveyance, as far as human care and foresight will go. 5. Damages—Time Lost.—There being no evidence of its value, a charge to allow for time lost was error. 6. Charge—Cause of Wreck.—When the evidence left it uncertain as to the cause of the wreck, and whether one defect or the combined effect of several defects caused the wreck, it was proper to give to the jury the rules by which appellants’ whole duty to the passengers was measured, in order that they might determine whether or not there had been neglect to perform it in any particular. 7. The word “Satisfied.” —A requested instruction which required that the jury should he “satisfied” that the apprehended results would flow from the injury, was properly refused.

"KEY, Associate Justice. This suit was instituted by appellants, as plaintiffs, on the 9th day of August, 1888, to recover damages against appellee, San Saba County, for an alleged unlawful appropriation of a strip of land for a public road, extending across a league and labor of land owned by appellants. Appellee pleaded title by prescription, and the two years statute of limitations was pleaded as a bar to appellants’ claim for damages. The appellants Mrs. S. A. Callahan and Mrs. Addie E. Leverett pleaded coverture in avoidance of the pleas of limitation and prescription, and appellant F. C. Cunningham pleaded minority for the same purpose. The appellants J. T. Cunningham, A. C. Cunningham, Mrs. Addie E. Leverett, Mrs. S. A. ""Callahan, and Miss F. C. Cunningham inherited the tract ""of land across which the road in question runs from their father, who died on the 25th day of September, 1878, and who at the time of his death was insane, and had been in that condition for two or three years. The testimony shows that the road in question has been traveled and used by the public across appellants’ land for between fifteen and twenty years prior to the death of their father, and it has been so used and traveled ever since that time, embracing a strip of land about 40 feet wide, and running diagonally across the entire tract, varying in width, however, in some places from 10 to 75 yards, where the road would get muddy. There is no testimony showing affirmatively that the appellants knew of the existence of the road on their land until August, 1883; nor is it shown that San Saba County, or any one acting for it or in behalf of the public, ever claimed the exclusive right of the county or the public to use the strip of land in question as a public road until August, 1878. It appears that in May, 1877, the Commissioners Court of San Saba County appointed a jury of view to establish a second class road from the town of San Saba to Chick’s Crossing, on the Colorado River. The jury reported on the 12th day of August, 1878, establishing the road, in so far as this case is concerned, upon the same ground across the appellants’ land as the road hereinbefore mentioned. Thereafter, and during the August term, 1878, of the Commissioners Court of said county, said court adopted the report of the jury of view, ordered the road to be opened, appointed an overseer for it, and apportioned hands to work the same. Such annual appointment of an overseer of the road and apportionment of hands have been kept up by the Commissioners Court of the county from that time to time of the trial: and it was shown affirmatively that such overseers and hands have kept the road op.en and free from obstructions, and worked the same for the county, from 1883 to the time of trial, except one week in July, 1887. Sometime in July, 1887, the appellants built a fence across the road in question, and the sheriff of the county, acting under the order of the county judge, removed the fence from across the road. It was shown, that the jury of view gave no notice to appellants of their intention to lay off a road on their land; that they had no opportunity to present their claim for damages to the jury; and that no compensation had ever been allowed them for the use of said land or for the damage resulting from the establishment of the road thereon. Before bringing this suit appellants presented their claim for damages to the Commissioners Court of the county, and the same was rejected in toto. Appellants’ tract of land upon which the road is located is open prairie, and has never been under fence, nor used for any purpose except that of grazing live stock. The court below held: 1. That at the time of the death of the father of the appellants the public had acquired an easement in the land, and that appellants inherited the same subject to the easement. 2. That the Commissioners Court of San Saba County having established the road in August, 1878, appellants’ cause of action was barred by the statute of limitation. We do not concur in the holding that the public had acquired an easement by prescription. As a general rule, before a highway can be established by prescription, it must appear that the general public, under a claim of right, and not by mere permission of the owner, used some defined way, without interruption or substantial change, for at least the longest period of limitation prescribed by statute against an action for the land; and many authorities hold that such use must be held for at least twenty years. Elliott on Roads and Streets, 137; Schellhouse v. State, 110 Ind., 509; State v. Green, 41 Ia., 619; Pentland v. Keep, 41 Wis., 490; Johnson v. Lewis, 47 Ark., 66. Where the use is merely permissive, and not adverse, there is no basis on which a right of way by prescription can rest. For this reason, it has been held that the use of vacant unenclosed land for twenty years by the public in passing and repassing will give them no prescriptive rights. State v. Horne, 35 Kans., 717; Rathman v. Norrenberg, 21 Neb., 467; Herrold v. Chicago, 108 Ill., 467; State v. Mitchell, 58 Ia., 567; Railway v. Parker, 41 N. J. Eq., 489; Stewart v. Frink, 94 N. C., 487. Applying these tests to the case before us, we find that at least one essential element of a right founded upon prescription is wanting. It was not shown that the county, or any one acting for it or for the public, ever asserted a right to the use of the land in question for a public road, adverse to the title and rights of the appellants, until August, 1878. Up to that time the use of the route traveled by the public as a public highway appears to have been merely permissive, and not antagonistic to-the rights of appellants. Besides, it has been held that a public road can not be established by prescription while the land over which the road runs is unimproved and unoccupied prairie land, over which people may travel at their pleasure. Smith v. Smith, 34 Kans., 293; State v. O’Laughlin, 19 Kans., 504; Railway v. Long, 27 Kans., 684; Graham v. Harnett, 10 Neb., 517; Hewins v. Smith, 52 Mass., 241; Hardin v. Jasper, 14 Cal., 643. Upon the question of limitation, our conclusion is, that subdivision 1 of article 3203 of the Revised Statutes, which requires actions for injury done the estate or property of another to be brought within two years, has application; but our most difficult task has been to determine when this statute began to run. The action of. the Commissioners Court in approving the report of the jury of view and appointing an overseer and hands for the road was not binding as against appellants’ ancestor, who owned the land; yet, whenever the owner obtained knowledge of the fact that the county, acting through the road overseer, had taken actual and visible possession of the road by working it, thereby asserting a claim to it for the county, then we believe limitation began to run. This appears to be the doctrine announced in Franklin County v. Brooks, 68 Texas, 679; but, as there expressed, it is a mere statement of what the rule would be in a case different from the one then under consideration, and is therefore obiter dictum. The action of the Commissioners Court in approving the report of the jury of view, etc., in so far as appellants are concerned, was an ex parte order, without binding force upon them; nor did it interfere in anywise with their possession or use of the land; and until appellants were apprised of its existence, we know of no rule of law that would justify us in holding that they were chargeable with notice thereof, in the absence of such facts as would put them upon inquiry. Delivered November 23, 1892. The overseer and hands assigned by the Commissioners Court going on the ground and working the road was, in our opinion, sufficient to put the owners of the land upon inquiry, and from that time the statute of limitations will run against appellants, except those who are under such disabilities as exempt them from its provisions. While the testimony shows that overseers and hands were assigned to this road annually from 1878, it does not affirmatively appear that they worked the road at any time prior to 1883; and as two of the appellants were married women at that time, limitation did not begin nor run against them. It is to be noted that this suit is for damages, and not for a recovery of the land. If the action was for the land, or if appellants’ petition contained an alternative prayer for the land, the question of limitation, as against the suit for the land, would be altogether different from the one that we have just passed upon. Nor have we considered the question as to whether a failure to recover damages, because of the plea of limitation, would bar a right of the ■owner of the land to maintain an action for its recovery. It is settled, in the case of Hamilton County v. Garrett, 62 Texas, 602, that suits of this character may be maintained against counties; and appellants had the right to select this remedy alone if they saw proper to do so. Because of the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the rules of law above stated. Reversed and remanded.","J. T.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This is a suit of trespass to try title, brought by appellants McCurdy & Daniels, against appellee J. P. Locker, for the Wm. McFarland 320 acres survey in Bosque County, patented February 9, 1847. Defendant pleaded not guilty, disclaimed all interest in the McFarland survey and possession thereof; “ that he is not now and was not at the institution of the suit in possession of said land and premises described in plaintiffs’ petition.” But he sets up that he was in possession of the south half of the E. D. Johnson 320 acres survey, which 160 acres are described in the answer as beginning at the southwest corner of said Johnson; thence north 30 west 760 varas to the northwest corner, marked by a pile of rock; thence north 60 east 950 varas to the northeast corner of this; thence south 30 east 760 varas to the southeast corner of this; thence south 60 west 950 varas to the beginning. Defendant also set up, in bar, statute of limitation of five years to the same 160 acres. The McFarland and the Johnson surveys were made by the same surveyor, the former on the 28th and the latter on the 29th day of September, 1846. The original field notes of the McFarland call for two willow trees as witnesses of its northwest corner, and thence north 60 east 950 varas to its northeast corner, where two live oak trees are called for as witness trees. The Johnson calls to begin at the northwest corner of the McFarland; thence to run north 60 east 950 varas to the southeast corner of the Johnson, at both corners calling for the very witness trees named in the McFarland; that is to say, the north line of the McFarland is the south line of the Johnson. The locality of this line was in dispute, plaintiffs claiming it at one place and defendant claiming it to be further south. This question was submitted to the jury, together with defendant’s plea of limitation. The verdict located the line where plaintiffs claimed it to be, “ 20 varas north 30 west from the branch as claimed by plaintiffs;” but the jury also found in favor of defendant’s plea of limitation, and awarded him the land actually occupied by him, about 34 acres, a strip off of the north end of the McFarland, 200 varas wide, for which judgment was rendered in his favor, and plaintiffs appealed. There are several assignments of error to rulings of the court on the answer of defendant, to the admission of testimony, to the charge submitting the plea of limitation, and other matters; but they nearly all relate to one subject, more or less directly, that as defendant disclaimed ownership or possession of any part of the McFarland survey, and as his plea of limitation and deeds restricted his claim to the E. D. Johnson survey, he could not recover under the plea any part of the McFarland,, where the jury found the disputed land to be. This is doubtless correct. The statement of facts shows that plaintiffs, owned the McFarland, and that defendant owned the south half of the Johnson survey as described in his answer. The deeds to support the' pleas of limitation, according to the statement of facts, describe the land conveyed as the “south half” and “off the south end” of the Johnson survey, as described in defendant’s answer. Under his pleadings, defendant could not recover any part of the McFarland survey; but if the plea of limitation had claimed or described land on the McFarland, there was no deed or deeds to defendant of any part of it. His deeds confined him to the Johnson. To maintain the-plea of five years limitation, there must not only be proof of adverse and continuous possession for the necessary period, paying the taxes, but the possession must be under deed or deeds duly registered, describing the land so claimed. The description must be such as will give notice to the owner of the claim. The owner is conclusively presumed to know the contents of the recorded deed—the description of the land—but nothing more. Had the owners of the McFarland survey read the deeds to Lusk, and from him and wife to defendant, they would have had no intimation therefrom that he was claiming any part of the McFarland. Defendant’s claim by possession was based upon the supposition or belief that the land was on the Johnson, and his plea rests his right of recovery on that fact. The fact that it was alleged that the lines and corners were marked did not change the description which included the land within the Johnson; such marks, if any, were not given. The description in the deeds of the land—the south end of the Johnson—would still remain the same. A deed may by mistake refer to a wrong survey and yet be sufficient to support the plea, if it otherwise, by external objects found on the ground, definitely designates the land in possession. It is not necessary to discuss the effect of such conflicting description, as no such question arises in this case. Flanagan v. Boggess, 46 Texas, 335; Kilpatrick v. Sisneros, 23 Texas, 137; Brokel v. McKechnie, 69 Texas, 32; Udell v. Peak, 70 Texas, 549; Jones v. Andrews, 62 Texas, 668. Defendant’s possessory claim is based upon the supposition that the land is a part of the Johnson, both as regards the plea and proof. But the plea could not change the proof. By the case as made, there was no occasion for a plea of limitation, predicated on a deed, as if the land was not on the south end of the Johnson, plaintiffs could not recover it. They only showed title to the McFarland. We do not say the verdict fixing the boundary is correct, but it did fix it so as to leave the disputed land on the McFarland, where plaintiffs claim it. This was conclusive upon the jury, and the rest of their verdict was impossible. The verdict was inconsistent, and did not authorize the judgment. The judgment was erroneous, and should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 18, 1893","McCurdy & Daniels v. J. P. Locker. No. 67. 1.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This was a suit for specific performance, brought by appellant upon the following instrument: “Galveston, February 24, 1890. “Received from Dr. D. S. Killough §50 for an option to buy within six days from 12 o’clock Monday, February 25, A. D. 1890, the northeast and southeast blocks of outlot number 85, city of Galveston, Texas, and improvements thereon, except lot number 85; and it is further agreed and understood, that a one-sixth interest in the within named property is owned by a minor son of C. H. Lee, and the sale of his interest is contingent upon authority from the court. The price agreed upon is §12,000 cash, upon payment of which the said Charles H. Lee will make deed for his five-sixths interest, and make application to court for the sale of interest of his minor son. This option closes and expires by limitation at 12 o’clock, March 2, A. D. 1890, being six days from this date. [Signed] “C. H. Lee, “By J. W. Riddell, Agent. “Accepted. [Signed] “ D. S. Killough.” The petition alleged, that within the six days allowed in which appellant could buy the property, he notified the agent of appellee that he would take it, and offered to deposit with the agent such an amount as might be required of him to bind the purchase; that the agent declined to accept any less sum than §12,000, stipulated in the agreement as the price of the land; that it was the custom of Galveston, on purchase of real estate, for the purchaser to deposit a reasonable amount of money with the seller as earnest of his good faith and intention to carry out the contract of purchase, to be held by the seller pending the examination of the title. It appeared from the petition that the purchase money of the land was neither paid nor tendered within the six days. Exceptions to the petition were sustained and the cause was dismissed by the court below. The only question which is presented for our determination is whether or not the failure of appellant to pay the price stipulated for the land before the time fixed when the option should expire put an end to his rights under the agreement. Appellant contends that his notice to appellee’s agent that he would take the land upon the terms proposed was an exercise of his option, and that he thereby acquired the right to pay for and acquire the land within such reasonable time thereafter as was necessary to enable him to satisfy himself as to the title, and that the payment of the price within the six days was not by the contract made essential. We can not assent to this view of the transaction. The option which appellant had was to buy within six days. Therefore whatever was requisite in order to buy, was by the express terms of the writing required to be done within that time, and was therefore essential to invest appellant with the right to a conveyance of the land. Consequently, unless it can be said that notice to the agent of his acceptance of the proposed trade constituted a purchase of the property by appellant, he must fail. In our opinion this conclusion is forbidden by the terms of the contract, which prescribes in what manner appellant may buy the land, viz., by the payment of $12,000 cash. The word “buy” in the writing means not simply an acceptance of the offer, but a purchase, completed by payment. It is true that in ordinary contracts for the sale of lands on a credit the time fixed for payment is not ordinarily deemed by courts of equity to be of the essence of the contract, so as to defeat specific performance after the expiration thereof; and there is always a strong inclination to relieve defaulting vendees from forfeiture of their right to have their purchase enforced, especially where interest may be considered adequate satisfaction to the vendor for the delay. The reasons by which courts are guided in their decisions upon questions of that character have very little, if any, force in the determination of cases like this. Even in them, payment at the time stipulated may be made essential by the contract of the parties or the circumstances of the case. Edwards v. Atkinson, 14 Texas, 373. In cases of options, there is some conflict of authority as to the essentiality of the time of payment. The principles applicable are thus stated: “Where the contract is really an offer on one side, with a proviso that this offer must be assented to and accepted when a mere acceptance is contemplated, or payment must be made when payment was the act of acceptance contemplated, at or before a specified date, then of course the net of assent or of payment must be done within the prescribed time; and time is from the very form of the contract essential. If, therefore, a vendor agrees to convey if payment be made at or before a given date, or if an option is given which is to be accepted by payment within a given time, then the time of payment is certainly essential; in fact, payment is a condition precedent to the vesting of any right in the vendee. If, however, the offer or option given requires assent and acceptance within a given time, such assent must be made within the time prescribed, and the contract thereby becomes concluded and mutual; but whether time is essential with respect to subsequent performance must depend upon"" its object or the nature of its subject matter.” Pome, on Con., sec. 387. The contract under consideration required not simply that appellant should assent to the terms proposed within the six days, and pay the price at some subsequent time, but that he should buy within that time, paying the price in cash. Thus payment was made essential by the agree•menl of the parties, which the court can not disregard without infringing upon their right to shape their own contracts as they deem best. The judgment is therefore affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 2, 1893.","S. D. Killough v. C. H. Lee. No. 86. 1. Option to Purchase Land. — The appellant paid $50 for an option to buy within six days thereafter a lot in Galveston for $12,000 cash, upon payment of which appellee was to make deed. Within the six days he notified the agent of appellee that he would take it, and offered to deposit such amount as might be required of him to bind the purchase pending examination of title; which was declined, and payment of the whole $12,000 required. Held, the word “buy” in the writing means not simply an acceptance of the offer, but a purchase completed by payment. 2. Construction of Contract. — The contract required not simply that appellant should assent to the terms proposed within the six days, and pay the price at some subsequent time, but that he should buy within that time, paying the price in cash. Appeal from Galveston. Tried below before Hon. William H. Stewart. George E. Mann, for appellant. The court erred in sustaining defendant’s general demurrer to second amended original petition, in that the ruling necessarily construed the contract sued on to be that plaintiff had to pay the purchase money within the six days in which he had the option to buy.

Arrant, 25 Texas, 134. Gresham & Jones, for appellee. 1. Time is of the essence of the contract sued on; and there is nothing in plaintiff’s petition to show that he had, within the time limited in the contract, done or was ready and had offered to do that which was required of him by the terms of that contract; that is to say, had not only elected to buy, but had actually bought the property by paying or tendering to the defendant or his agent the purchase money.

There is a want of mutuality in the contract sued on, and the court therefore did not err in sustaining the demurrer to the petition. Specific performance by Killough could not be decreed or enforced at the suit of Lee; for Killough, by the express stipulations of the contract, could buy or decline to buy the property described therein, as he might elect; and even if Lee were bound to sell at the election of Killough, Killough was not bound to elect to buy or to buy the property. The only liability of Killough, on his refusal or failure to buy, was the forfeiture of the §50 paid by him for the exclusive right to purchase at the price agreed on within the time stipulated in the contract.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. In August, 1889, the Commissioners Court of Cooke County established a second class public road known as the Rock Bluff and County Line road, the northern terminus of which is at Red River, on land owned by appellant. Since the establishment of said road, appellee, without any license from the Commissioners Court of Cooke County, has been engaged in operating a ferry across Red River, landing his passengers upon that part of appellant’s land condemned for use as a public road under the laws of this State as aforesaid, and appellant instituted this suit to recover the land, and also to enjoin appellee from its use for said ferry purposes. The court below gave appellant judgment for the land, but refused the injunction; and from the judgment refusing the injunction appellant prosecutes this appeal. This question has been so ably and exhaustively treated in an opinion delivered by Justice Dillon, while a member of the Supreme Court of Iowa, in the case of Prosser v. Wapello County, 18 Iowa, 327, that it would be a waste of time upon our part to attempt to add anything to what is there said, and we shall content ourselves with copying at length from that opinion as follows: ‘ ‘ This brings us to the next question, and that is, whether the location of a county road on the land does, to the extent of its width on the bank of the river, deprive the land owner of his riparian rights as above defined. “And here we feel compelled to yield our doubts to the almost if not quite uniform current of authority, and to hold that it does not. The argument is this: By the location of the road the public acquire simply the right of way over the soil; the bare right of passage and its incidents, nothing more. Deaton v.

Ward, 1 Wils., 110, 111. “ The property or freehold still remains in the owner of the land; how completely so, the case last cited, with others there referred to, strikingly illustrate. 1 '■ This question has arisen in several cases, and among others in Pipkins v. Wynns, before cited (2 Dev., N. C., 402), and which overruled Rayner v. Dowdy, 1 Murph., 279. Speaking of this subject, Henderson, C. J., says: 1 For the uses and purposes of a highway it (the highway) is the sovereign’s—the public’s; for all other purposes it is the former proprietor’s. The right of using it as a landing place for a ferry has never been taken from him; and although there is scarcely a perceptible difference between stepping from a boat on the land and stepping from land to land, yet that has never been taken from the former proprietor for such purposes, as he has never been compensated for the right (limited as above stated) of transporting persons across the watercourse, as that was not considered when the price of taking the land for a highway was fixed; and although it is of little value without the franchise, yet the ownership of the land gives him the preferable right to call for the franchise when the ferry becomes necessary. This right is valuable, for, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, the sovereign must grant it to the owner, as sovereigns are bound to be just. * * * If it be asked, what is to be done if the owner of land, where a ferry is necessary, refuses to receive the franchise, it is answered, to pay him for the land and grant it to another. * * * Let it not be taken for a road and used as a ferry.’ It was accordingly held, that compensation must be made to the owner of the fee for the use of the soil for the ferry right, although there is a public road leading to the river on both sides. “And such is substantially the decisions in Tennessee (Memphis v. Overton, 3 Yerger, 387) and in Pennsylvania. Thus in Chambers v. Furey, 1 Yeates (1792), 167, it was decided that the dedication or laying out of ground as a public road gave no right to the defendants, the owners of a ferry, to land upon or receive freight from the plaintiff’s freehold on the banks of a navigable river, without his consent. That the owner of a ferry has no right to land his passengers or boat on a public highway without the consent of the owner of the soil, see, also, Cooper v. Smith, 9 Sergeant & Eawle, 31 (1822); not even (it was held in a subsequent case) at the terminus of a highway between high and low water mark. Chess v. Manoun, 3 Watts, 219 (1834); and see Bird v. Smith, 8 Watts, 434; also, the thoroughly considered case of Pearsall v. Post, 20 Wendell, 111-131, in which the doctrine of the Pennsylvania cases above cited is approved. There is ,a dictum contra per Bailey, Judge, in Peter v. Kendal, 6 Barnewald & Cresswell, 703. “ Whether the decision in Chess v. Manoun, above cited, is reconcilable with McManus v. Carmichael, 3 Iowa, 1, is a question of some difficulty. See, on this subject, Prosser v. Davis, infra. ‘ ‘ Without committing ourselves to the entire correctness of all the positions taken in these cases, which we have referred to as illustrating the subject, we feel free in holding: “1. That the dedication or taking of land for a public highway does not, in cases where the owner retains the fee and the public have only an easement, deprive such owner of his preferable right to a ferry, if one is established. 2. That a ferry license to a stranger will not authorize him, against the consent of the owner, or without compensating him therefor, to use the termini of such highway, certainly above high water mark (see on this point, Prosser v. Davis, infra), for the purpose of fastening boats and of receiving and discharging freight and passengers. Such a use is not a public use, so much as it is a use by the licensee or holder of the franchise for his own gain and advantage. Like the use of an ordinary road for railway purposes, such a use for ferry purposes would be an additional burden or servitude, for which compensation must be made to the owner. Milburn v. Cedar Rapids, etc., 12 Iowa, 246, 259. Forcibly illustrative of this question, see Mahon v. Railway, 24 N. Y., 658; Carpenter v Railway, 24 N. Y., 655; Wager v. Railway, 25 N. Y., 526; Bissell v. Railway, 23 N. Y., 61; Fletcher v. Railway, 25 Wend., 462; Davis v. Mayor, 14 N. Y., 526; Williams v. Railway, 16 N. Y., 97-106, reviewing Chief Justice Gibson’s opinion, contra, in Philadelphia v. Railway, 6 Whart., 25; and see, where owner parts with fee, Aldrich v. Wallace, 8 Dana (Ky.), 289; 16 N. Y., 97; arguendo, Wager v. Railway, 25 N. Y., 526-533.” This decision was approved by the same court in the case of Prosser v. Davis, 18 Iowa, 367, and it is there held, that on the application of the riparian owner the proprietor of a ferry will be enjoined from landing his boat on the land of such owner that has not been condemned to that use and the owner compensated therefor. It follows, therefore, that we are of opinion that the court below erred in not granting the injunction as prayed for by appellant. It will be borne in mind that appellee did not claim to be licensed by the Commissioners Court of Cooke County to operate a public ferry at the terminus of this road, but only claimed the right to operate a private ferry, regulating his own tolls, he being at the time a citizen of the Indian Territory., and we are therefore not called upon to decide whether or not the condemnation of the land for the purpose of a public road since article 4436 of our Revised Statutes has been in force will authorize the operation of a public ferry in connection therewith under a license from the Commissioners Court of the proper county. This last named article, after authorizing a riparian owner to operate a public ferry with the consent of the owner of the land on the opposite shore, provides, “if such consent can not be obtained he may apply to the Commissioners Court for the establishment of a public road from said opposite shore, and said court shall act on said application as in other cases.’ ’ In the case of Tugwell & Madison v. Eagle Pass Ferry Company, 74 Texas, 480, our Supreme Court strongly intimates, if it does not decide, ' that the condemnation of a püblic road from such opposite shore would, under this statute, authorize the owner of such public ferry to land his boat upon the land so condemned. In this ease we only decide that the operator of a private ferry can not, without license from the proper Commissioners Court, land his boat without the consent of the riparian proprietor upon his land, even where it has been condemned for the purpose of a public road under our statute. As establishing that the estate and rights acquired by condemnation proceedings for a public use in this State do not extend beyond the purpose for which the condemnation is made, see O’Neal v. The City of Sherman, 77 Texas, 182; Lyon v. McDonald, 78 Texas, 71. For the error above indicated, let that part of the judgment of the court below which refuses the injunction prayed for by appellant Buford, and adjudges the costs against him, be reversed and here rendered, granting such injunction against appellee Smith, and adjudging appellee to pay the costs of this appeal and of the court below; and in all other respects let the judgment rendered by the court below be affirmed. lieversed and rendered. Delivered January 31, 1893.","W. R. Buford v. Lark Smith. No. 79. Ferry—Public Road—Right of Riparian Owner.—The operator of a private ferry, without license from the proper Commissioners Court, can not land his boat on property condemned under the statute for a public road without the consent of the riparian proprietor of the land so condemned. Appeal from Cooke. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Potter, Potter & Mathis, for appellant.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. December 13, 1888, the appellee company, as plaintiff, brought suit against J. H. Brush, D. H. White,"" W. A. Allan, A. S. McKinney, and L. H. Carhart as defendants. July 12, 1889, it dismissed its suit against the four persons last named, retaining J. H. Brush, appellant herein, as the sole defendant. Thereupon, at the instance of Brush, the parties- against whom the dismissal was had were again made parties to the proceedings. The plaintiff sued to recover of the defendant Brush the sum of $6525, besides interest, alleged to be due on a contract for the pasturage of certain cattle at the rate of $1.50 per head per annum. The items claimed to be due for pasturage were as follows: For 1900 head of cattle from August 1, 1886 (at which last named date the defendant sold and removed about 675 head), $2850; on August 1, 1887, for pasturage on 1225 head, $1837.50; and August 1, 1888, $1837.50. The defendant Brush, among other pleas (including a plea of payment of the first year’s pasturage), filed a special plea or cross-bill against the plaintiff company and against the remaining persons made parties at his instance. His allegations were, briefly and substantially stated, that himself, White, Allan, and McKinney were the joint owners of 1400 head of steer cattle placed in the pasture of plaintiff, and that himself, L. II. Car-hart, and W. A. Allan were the joint owners of 500 head of stock cattle there delivered; that a contract with the plaintiff company for the pasturage of the cattle was made between the plaintiff company and the parties named with reference to their several interests, and that these parties should be held to contribute to the payment of the pasturage, if any was due. He alleged, that on the delivery of the cattle to the plaintiff company, the latter undertook to perform the duties of an agistor with reference to them, and to take care of them with all reasonable diligence and attention; that in violation of its duty plaintiff had overstocked its pasture, and because of its willful and cruel negligence large numbers of the cattle were starved to death; that plaintiff had accounted for only 822 head of the cattle delivered to it; that the remainder, aggregating in value $24,382, had been lost through the willful negligence of the plaintiff or converted to its own use. The defendant prayed for relief in accordance with these allegations. The court tried the case without a jury, and rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff against the defendant Brush for $1433.80, and in favor of White, Allan, McKinney, and Carhart against the cross-action of Brush; hence the latter has appealed to this court. The defendant requested no special findings of fact by the trial court. We find in the record, however, the court’s conclusions of law. Wherever, as in this case, there is on any issue a material conflict in the evidence, and no conclusions of fact are sought or found by the trial court, it becomes our duty to so interpret the testimony as to sustain the legal conclusions or the judgment appealed from. Applying this rule, we find the following conclusions of fact: 1. On May 5, 1885, J. H. Brush, B. H. White, A. S. McKinney, and W. A. Allan entered into the following agreement: “It is agreed by and between J. H. Brush and B. H. White, A. S. McKinney, and W. A. Allan, that in case J. H. Brush buys from 1000 to 2000 one or two-year-old steers, to be kept on the Clarendon Land and Investment Agency Company’s ranch in Donley County, Texas, till they are three years old, and then driven to market with the beef steers by said company, and to be sold by L. II. Carhart as ágent for account of said parties, and after said steers are bought, the said Brush shall execute to said White, McKinney, and Allan a contract for a three-quarter interest in said steers to be so kept and sold as above, then the said White, McKinney, and Allan will execute a written agreement to said Brush to jointly assume all liabilities of and pay for a three-fourths interest in said steers, and pay said Brush 10 per cent interest on the money invested in their part of said steers, to be computed annually; Brush to pay all transportation and other charges up to the time of the sale of the cattle, and to receive at the time of and from proceeds of sale of the steers the pay for said White, McKinney, and Allan’s part of the cattle, and then they are to receive all proportionate gain over cost, charges, and interest on the transaction, or pay their proportionate of the loss, if any. u Clarendon, May 5, 1885. “ J. H. Brush, „ “B. H. White, “A. S. Mckinney, “ W. A. Allan.” 2. Subsequently, during the summer of 1885, J. H. Brush, L. H. Car-hart, and W. A. Allan entered into a verbal contract with reference to 500 head of stock cattle, the contract being in other respects of tenor similar to that of the preceding written agreement. 3. J. II. Brush bought with his own funds and delivered for pasturage to the plaintiff about 1900 head of cattle in May and June, 1885. He agreed to pay to the plaintiff for pasturage services the sum of 81.50 per head per annum. He and the plaintiff alone were parties to the contract of pasturage. All the cattle were kept in plaintiff’s pasture until about the month of July, 1886, when the defendant Brush sold to different persons about 822 head. Before selling them he obtained the written consent of White, Allan, and McKinney with reference to the sale of such as were steer cattle, and of Allan and Carhart with reference to the sale of such as were stock cattle. This consent was given by the parties named, not because they claimed any interest in the cattle pastured or sold, but purely to accommodate Brush. 4. After the cattle were delivered to plaintiff for pasturage, Brush never made nor offered to make a bill of sale transferring a three-fourths interest in the cattle to the remaining parties named in the agreement above set out. The cattle, except the number sold and about 150 head which were in the pasture when this suit was instituted, died from stress of weather during the winter of 1885 and spring of. 1886. This loss was not due to the negligence of plaintiff, which bestowed upon the cattle such care and prudence as would a reasonable person upon his property under similar circumstances. The 150 head of cattle referred to were held by the company subject to the demand and disposition of their owner Brush. The defendant Brush has never made any payment upon the amount due for pasturage; and a sufficient amount to cover the sum adjudged by the court below is due for the pasturage of cattle before the sale and before the loss above referred to. 1. There was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the parties to this suit other than the defendant Brush. 2. The defendant Brush is liable to the plaintiff, under his contract of pasturage, in the amount adjudged against him by the trial court. 3. The plaintiff,' as an agistor, did not insure the safety of the animals entrusted to its care. It was held to ordinary care in looking after these animals, and is responsible for ordinary negligence with reference to them; and having bestowed such care upon them, it is not liable to the defendant Brush for their loss. Story on Bail., sec. 443. 4. As we interpret the contract between the defendant Brush and the remaining parties named in our first conclusion of fact, no interest in the cattle was to vest in these parties until Brush should execute in their behalf a contract transferring to them the interest specified in the agreement. The making of a bill of sale or contract conveying such interest is construed by us as a condition, a compliance with which on the part of Brush was necessary to beget liability on the part of the remaining parties to the agreement. The language of the contract, while quite obscure, and the circumstances under which it was executed, justify the conclusion that such an interpretation as we here state was intended by the parties. The contract left it quite within the option of Brush whether, in the first instance, he should buy the cattle at all, or in the second, whether he should transfer them to the remaining parties. This option he exerted by the purchase in the one case and the failure to transfer in the second. Anson on Con., 142. 5. As the cattle remaining in the pasture of the plaintiff were subject to the control and disposition of the defendant Brush, and as .it does not appear that plaintiff has converted them, appellant is not entitled to a judgment for their value. 6. Of the 150 head of cattle referred to in our conclusion of fact number 4, 21 head have been sold by the appellee’s manager pending this suit, by agreement of appellant and appellee. The proceeds, amounting to $420, have been deposited by the manager without prejudice to the parties to the suit. The judgment herein rendered is not to operate as a bar to the prosecution by appellant of any claim which he may have on account of the 150 head above mentioned, their proceeds, or value. These conclusions, we think, dispose of the questions presented in appellant’s several assignments of error. The judgment is therefore in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 31, 1893.","J. H. Brush v. The Clarendon Land, Investment, and Agency Company, Limited, et al. No. 69. 1. Construction of Contract—Exercise of Option—Want of Privity.—Plaintiff company sued B. for the pasturage of cattle, and B. impleaded' W., M., and A., as being joint owners with him of the cattle by virtue of a written agreement, which provided, “ that in ease B. buys” certain steer cattle, to be kept in plaintiff’s pasture until ready for market and sold for account of said parties, “ and after said steers are bought said B. shall execute to said W., M., and A. a contract for a three-quarter interest therein, * * * then the said W., M., and A. will execute a written agreement to said B..to jointly assume all liabilities of and to pay for a three-fourths interest in said steers,” and after paying B. interest at 10 per cent per annum on three-fourths of the money invested in said cattle, to receive their proportionate share of profits, or pay their share of losses, if any thereon. B. after this agreement bought steer cattle and placed them for pasturage on plaintiff’s ranch, but never offered to convey to W., M.,. and A. any interest therein. Held: 1. The agreement left it optional with B. whether he would convey any interest in the cattle to W., M., and A.; and having exercised the option by failing to make any such transfer, no interest in the cattle vested in the other three parties. 2. As B. alone made the contract with plaintiff for the pasturage of the cattle, he was alone liable therefor, there being no privity of contract between plaintiff •and the other three parties. 2. Agistment of Cattle — Liability only for Ordinary Care.— Plaintiff, as agistor, was liable for ordinary care in looking after the cattle entrusted to it, and responsible for ordinary negligence in relation to them; and having bestowed upon them such care as would a reasonably prudent man upon his own property under similar circumstances, it was not liable for the loss of such as died from stress of weather. 3. Conversion of Cattle Being Pastured.—As plaintiff has set up no claim to 150 head of the cattle estimated to be still running in its pastures, it is held not liable to B. in this suit for the conversion of them. Appeal from Donley. Tried below before Hon. G-. A. Brown. James C. Scott and W. R. Butler, for appellant. Plaintiff was an agistor of defendant’s cattle. It was bound to exercise reasonable care, and is liable to defendant for any losses occurring through negligence, by death of cattle or escape from its pasture, as well as by conversion of any of them.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. July 18,1868, appellants sued the appellees in trespass to try title. September 3,1888, the appellants amended their petition, upon which the case was tried. The amended petition described the land sued for as “ One suerte of land in the city of San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, known as the Maria Gertrudes de Torres suerte, bounded on the north by Thomas Martinez suerte, west by the Acequia Madre, south by the Fuentes suerte, and east by what was known at the time of the original grant as vacant land, and having a front of about 120 varas on said Acequia Madre, and running back 440 varas to said vacant lands, and being fully described in the plat made by G-. Friesleben, and made a part of the report of C. Hart-nett, surveyor herein; said property having been, without consent of petitioners, subdivided into lots and streets and alleys, as shown by said plat, as follows: Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, between Water Street on the west and Second Street on the east, bounded south by North Street and north by the north line of the suerte; lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, bounded west by Second Street, south by North Street, east by Third Street, and north by the north line of suerte; lots 1, 2, 3, 4, bounded west by Third Street, south by North Street, east by east line of suerte, and north by north line of the suerte; lots 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, bounded west by Water Street, south by an alley, east by Second Street, and north by North Street; lots 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16,15, bounded west by Second Street, south by alley, east by Third Street, north by North Street; lots 14, 13, 12, bounded west by Third Street, south by alley, east by east boundary line of this suerte, and north by North Street; and also a tier of fractional lots, bounded' west by Water Street, south by said Fuentes suerte, and east by east line of this suerte, and north by said alley; said tier of fractional lots crossing Second and Third streets. Said lots and streets comprising said Maria Gertrudes Torres suerte.” The petition also alleged that plaintiffs and defendants claimed the land from Philip Dimmitt as common source. Defendants plead not guilty, and the three, five, and ten years statutes of limitations; also deny that they are in possession of the land described in plaintiffs’ petition as the Maria Gertrudes de Torres suerte, and allege that they are in possession of the Ramon de la Fuentes suerte, of which the land sued for is a part; deny any title of plaintiffs in the land, and say that Philip Dimmitt is not common source. The plaintiffs, in replication to the pleas of limitations, plead minority and coverture. Verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of defendants. Findings of Fact. — 1. That the plaintiffs are the heirs at law of Philip Dimmitt and his wife. Philip Dimmitt died in 1841, and his wife in 1855. 2. From admission made at a former trial of this case and from recitals in deeds, it is evident that the Torres suerte and the Fuentes suerte formerly belonged to Philip Dimmitt. 3. No written conveyance was shown by defendants, passing title out of Philip Dimmitt and wife. 4. From the entire range of facts, the evidence is not sufficient to entitle the defendants to recover and hold all of the land by limitation. 5. The plaintiffs failed to show by evidence that the defendants were in possession of the Torres suerte, the land sued for; but, upon the contrary, the evidence in the record shows that these defendants and Beck, under whom they claim, asserted title to the Fuentes suerte, and that they were in possession of land within the boundaries of said suerte, and not in possession or claiming land within the Torres suerte. Delivered November 16, 1892. This being an ordinary action of trespass to try title, and the plaintiffs claiming title to the Maria Gertrudes de Torres suerte, and alleging a trespass by defendants upon that survey, and the defendants having denied that they were in possession of that suerte, but were in possession of the Fuentes suerte, the burden was upon the plaintiffs to prove that defendants were in possession of the land sued for and described in their petition. Having failed to do this, but, upon the contrary, the evidence showing that the defendants were within .the bounds of the Fuentes suerte, and not within the limits of the Torres suerte, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. The fact that Philip Dimmitt was formerly the o.wner of the Torres and Fuentes suertes, and may be regarded as the common source of title, would not relieve the plaintiffs from proving possession by defendants of the land sued for and described in their petition, when such possession is expressly denied. Plaintiffs will not be permitted to sue for one tract of land and recover another not described and mentioned in their petition. The evidence of witness Semlieges, as complained of in appellants’’ third assignment of error, was admissible, not upon the ground that plaintiffs were bound by the testimony of the deceased witness Paschal as given on the former trial, but upon the ground that Paschal’s statement as to what was said and done by Rodriguez when he pointed out the lines of the Fuentes suerte was admissible, it appearing that Rodriguez was dead when Paschal testified, and that he had known the lines of the suerte since 1825, the boundaries of the land being ancient when he pointed it out to Paschal. This disposition that we make of the case relieves us of the necessity of passing upon all the questions raised by the various assignments of error. The reading of a portion of their answer by appellees to the jury, as complained of in appellants’ sixteenth assignment of error, was in explanation of certain parts of the answer that were read by the appellants to the jury. We think it was error for the appellants, in the first instance, to read abandoned pleadings as evidence to prove a fact material; but when they did so, it was permissible for the appellees to introduce other parts of the answer that explained that so read. The judgment of the court below is affirmed. Affirmed.","Josephine Medlin et al. v. John Wilkens et al. No. 5. 1. Burden of Proof — Trespass to Try Title. — Defendants in an action of trespass to try title denied that they were in possession of the land sued for, alleging possession of an adjoining tract. In such case it devolved upon the plaintiffs to prove that the defendants were in possession of the land sued for; failing in this, plaintiffs could not recover. 2. Ancient' Boundaries — Testimony of Deceased Witness. — Touching the locality of an ancient boundary line, the testimony of a deceased witness at a former trial may be proved, although such testimony gave the declarations of a party then dead, made many years before, when the line, then ancient, was pointed out to the witness. 3. Abandoned Pleadings as Evidence. — Abandoned pleadings are incompetent to prove a material fact. If, however, portions of an answer be admitted in evidence, the party so reading from his adversary’s pleadings in evidence can not complain of the admission of other parts of such pleadings in explanation. Appeal from Bexar. Tried below before Hon. Gr. H. Noonan. The facts are given in the opinion, except as to the assignment of error concerning the admission of the testimony of witness Semlieges. Said witness for the defendants testified: “I was present at the last trial of this case, when Frank Paschal was examined as a witness. He is now dead. I recollect something of what Paschal testified to on that trial. Paschal said he was present with the appraisers of Dimmitt’s estate when the land was appraised and sold by Dimmitt’s administrator. That the northwest corner of the land began at an old stone dam in the Madre ditch, about 100 varas south of the Alameda, and went east to vacant lands, and south of the old stone dam along the ditch to the old Goliad road; that the boundaries were pointed out by an old Mexican, who was dead. I think he said his name was Rodriguez; that he knew all about the suerte; that it was called the Fuentes suerte.” Verdict and judgment for defendants, and the plantiffs appeal. Denman & Franklin, S. G. Newton, W. M. Rust, and T. T. Teel, for appellants. 1.

The appellees contend that under our system of pleading the appellants had no right to introduce any part of an answer on a former trial. The defendant in his answer may plead as many several matters, whether of law or fact, as he shall think necessary for his defense, and which may be pertinent to the cause. To allow the plaintiff to introduce a former answer would be virtually introducing one plea to destroy another. Rev. Stats., art. 1262; Coats v. Elliott, 23 Texas, 610-613. 4. The introduction of part of defendants’ answer on a former trial certainly entitled the defendants to the remainder of the answer upon the same subject matter, and explanatory of that part introduced by the plaintiffs. Smith v. Chenault, 48 Texas, 459; Wheeler v. Styles, 28 Texas, 246; Best on Ev., sec. 520; Whart. Ev., secs. 1102, 1103. 5. In the action of trespass to try title, where the defendant denies, specifically that he is in possession of the grant or tract of land claimed by the plaintiff, and sets up specifically the particular grant or tract in the possession of which he claims to be, before the defendant can be ousted it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove that the defendant is within the boundaries of the grant or tract set out in the petition. Echols v. McKie, 60 Texas, 41; Cook v. Dennis, 61 Texas, 246; McNamara v. Meunsch, 66 Texas, 69; Stroud v. Springfield, 28 Texas, 673. 6. It is elementary law in this State, that in the action of trespass to try title the plaintiff must recover in one of three ways: by proving, first, title from the sovereignty of the soil down to himself; second, by showing that he and the defendant claim title from a common source, and that the plaintiff’s title is the better from said source; third, by showing prior possession under one of the statutes of limitation, and using it as a weapon of offense. (a) Plaintiffs did not prove title from the sovereignty of the soil. (b) Plaintiffs have not proved that the defendants claimed identically the same land from the same source, and hence they have not entitled themselves to recover under the doctrine known in the action of trespass to try title as “ common source.” We regard this as the only question in this record."
"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This action was brought by the appellee, in the District Court of Grimes County, March 17, 1890, to recover of the appellant damages for personal injuries received while appellee was in the employment of the appellant as an engine wiper and night watchman in its yard at Navasota, in Grimes County, on or about the 4th or 5th of October, 1889. This appeal is from a judgment for the recovery of $3825 in behalf of the plaintiff below. The injuries were received while the plaintiff was attempting to couple an engine and tender to a coal car, in obedience to the direction of one Housh, who was the foreman of defendant’s yard at Navasota, and at the time of the injury was operating the engine. A train was expected in from Conroe on the defendant’s line about 1 o’clock a. m., and the foreman, who went to sleep, had told plaintiff to wake him up when the train came in, which plaintiff did. Housh then told Corley, another engine wiper and night watchman, who was working with plaintiff, to throw the switch, and told plaintiff to couple the switch engine to the coal car, while he got on the engine and backed it up to the coal car, so that plaintiff might make the coupling. Plaintiff testified: “ Housh backed the engine towards the coal car and stopped about five feet from it. I hallooed to him to slow a little more back, and he backed the engine a little further, to about one and a half feet from the coal car, and stopped. I then hallooed to him to come a little more back, and he pulled the throttle open and came back so hard that he caught my left hand, with which I held the link, and shoved it, with the link, into the drawhead of the engine, and mashed it.” As foreman of the yard, Housh had the authority to employ and discharge the engine wipers, who were under his charge. It was not plaintiff’s business to couple ears. For the purpose of switching in the yard a switch engine is used. It has a sloping tank, so that one can see over the tender, and is safer to switch with than a road engine. The engine used when the accident occurred was an ordinary road engine. Plaintiff knew that switch engines were safer than road engines, and that coupling cars was dangerous work. Plaintiff’s right of recovery is based on two grounds; first, the incompetency or negligence of the foreman Housh; second, the use by the defendant of a common road engine instead of a switch engine; and in the first instance, that it might result either from the negligence of the defendant, treating Housh as the fellow servant of plaintiff, in selecting and employing its servants, or treating Housh as a vice-principal, from the negligence of Housh in pulling open the throttle and backing the engine with too much force. On the trial of the case, the court, in its charge to the jury, which is the basis of the second assignment of error, seems at first to have given an instruction on the theory that Housh was the fellow servant of the plaintiff; but the jury were afterward instructed that Housh was a vice principal and not the fellow servant of plaintiff. But the second assignment questions the charge for error in requiring too great care of railway companies in the employment of their servants and furnishing tools and appliances for them to work with. It is as follows: “ The railway company was bound in law to furnish competent and qualified men to handle its engines and trains at the yard at Navas ota, and was also bound in law to furnish means and appliances for switching trains which experienced railway men had found were safest and best adapted for that purpose; and if the company failed or was guilty of negligence in either regard in this paragraph named, and if from and by reason of said negligence injury resulted as a direct and proximate consequence thereof, the railway company is liable.” This charge was error. Its effect was to instruct the jury that the failure “to furnish competent and qualified men to handle its engines and trains at the yard at Navasota,” and “to furnish means and appliances for switching trains which experienced railway men had found were safest for that purpose,” would be negligence on the part of the company. Such is not the rule, as has been frequently announced in the decisions of our Supreme Court. The company is only required, in the selection of its employes and in furnishing appliances to work with, to use such cave and caution in doing so as an ordinarily prudent man would use under the circumstances, and not absolutely to select competent men or furnish safe appliances. Railway v. Wells, 81 Texas, 685; Railway v. Bell, 75 Texas, 50. That the use of a road engine was more dangerous than a switch engine was a fact equally as well known to plaintiff as to Housh, and the danger in its use was patent to the plaintiff; and such being the case, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover on the ground that a road engine used for the purposes of switching involved him in greater danger than a switch engine. In the attempt to make the coupling he assumed the risk of danger, because the defect was open to him. He knew that it was a road engine and that a switch engine was safer than a road engine for the purpose of switching cars. The charge complained of in the sixth and ninth assignments of error was wrong, and the requested instruction, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the ground of using a road engine instead of a switch engine, should have been given. Railway v. Brentford, 79 Texas, 619; Railway v. Somers, 71 Texas, 700; Rogers v. Railway, 76 Texas, 502. The same principle will also apply to knowledge that the coemploye was not competent for the work to be done. Plaintiff knew that Housh was a machinist and not a regular engineer. If this rendered him incompetent, and plaintiff knew it, then he would be charged with knowledge of the danger in attempting to make the coupling with a man in charge of the engine who was not well qualified for the work, and will be held to have assumed the risk. If plaintiff undertook the work with patent and obvious danger, no amount of prudence on his part would relieve him of the risk; and the test is not whether a reasonably prudent man might have undertaken the work, but whether the danger was obvious and apparent, or in fact known to him. Railway v. Bradford, 66 Texas, 737. The charge of the court complained of under the fourth, fifth, and seventh assignments of error had incorporated in it the idea that if the danger was not so patent and obvious that plaintiff, as a reasonably prudent man, might have undertaken the work, then he would not be charged with the risk, but would be entitled to recover. As we have seen, this was error. Again, although Housh may not have been well qualified for the work, and this fact was not known to the plaintiff, no recovery could be had except for negligence in handling the engine. If he handled it carefully and prudently, as an engineer of ordinary care and prudence would have done under the circumstances, then the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, even if the jury should believe that he was not well qualified for the work to be done. This would also apply in case he should be treated as a vice principal or representative of the defendant. Defendant requested instructions limiting its liability to the negligence of Housh, and they should have been given by the court; for, under the charges complained of, the jury may have found for the plaintiff if they believed the danger not so obvious or patent but that a man of ordinary prudence would have undertaken the work, and at the same time have believed that Housh was not guilty of negligence. Appellant contends that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and the evidence, in that it shows that plaintiff, before he undertook to make the coupling in connection with Housh acting as engineer, had full knowledge of the fact that Housh was a machinist and not a regular engineer, having had such knowledge for several days or weeks prior to the night of the accident; and plaintiff, in undertaking to work with Housh as engineer under such circumstances, thereby assumed the risk of injury or accident by inability of Housh to properly handle the engine. As the case must be tried again, and the effect of such knowledge having already been determined, we do not deem it necessary to inquire whether or not the facts as shown on the last trial proved such knowledge. For the same reason, we do not pass on the eighteenth assignment, that the evidence shows that Housh was handling the engine with proper care, and the accident could not have been caused by any negligence of Housh, or on account of the road engine being used. Appellant’s third, eighth, and eleventh assignments of error are: “ 3. The court erred in charging the jury as follows: Under the facts in this case Housh was not a fellow servant of Schwabbe, but was Schwabbe’s superior, and was the representative of the defendant company; and if Housh directed Schwabbe to make the coupling, and Schwabbe attempted to do so, and while doing so you find that he was injured by the negligence of Housh in handling the car, or was injured by the unfitness and unsuitableness of the engine used, or that he was injured by means of the two forces combined, then the company is liable, unless you find for the company under the instructions hereinafter given. “ 8. The court erred in charging the jury as follows: If you find that Housh did not handle the engine with the care and skill and prudence that an ordinarily prudent engineer would have .used under like circumstances, and that by reason of such negligence on Housh’s part, and without negligence on Schwabbe’s part, Schwabbe was injured, the defendant is liable. “11. The court erred in refusing to give the first special charge requested by the defendant, which is as follows: In so far as the negligence complained of is concerned, Housh and plaintiff were fellow servants, and you will find a verdict for the defendant.” Upon these assignments the appellant bases the following proposition: 11 The true test to determine who are fellow servants is to be found in the character of the act which causes the injury, and not in the grade, rank, or department of service of the person performing it. If the negligence causing the injury is the neglect of a duty which the master owes to his employes, the master is liable, whether the party guilty of the negligence is the master himself or a coemploye to whom he has committed the discharge of such duty; and if a coemploye, such coemploye is, as to the performance of such duty, a vice principal and not a fellow servant; but if the negligence causing the injury is not the neglect of a duty the master owes Ms employes, the master is only liable when he is personally guilty of the negligence, and not when it is the fault of a coemploye of the party injured; for all coemployes, whatever their grade, are fellow servants, except when engaged in the discharge of a duty the master owes'his employes. In other words, the same party may be in some matters a vice principal and in others a mere fellow servant, the test being, that in performing the duties which a master owes to the servant he is a vice principal; in the discharge of all other duties he is a fellow servant.” Delivered December 22, 1892. While we do not assent to the rule as stated in proposition of the appellant above quoted, still a majority of this court is of the opinion, that under the facts of this case Housh was the fellow servant of the plaintiff and not the representative of the company. In handling the engine Housh was not in the performance of any duty which the company owed to the plaintiff, but was engaged in doing an act as the fellow servant of the plaintiff, which, taken in connection with the act to be performed by the plaintiff, would result in switching the coal car from one track to another. Suppose a hostler had been on the engine, it would not be contended that the hostler and the engine wiper were not fellow servants. The only reason for the position that Housh was the representative of the company is, that he, as foreman of the yard, had authority to discharge the plaintiff, and the exercise of an act by him which would ordinarily be the act of a fellow servant is to be regarded as the act of the principal. It occurs to us that the difficulty lies in the failure to separate the individual as the person who handled the engine from himself as the foreman of the yard, charged with duties toward the plaintiff as the representative of the company. If Housh was guilty of any negligence in backing the engine, it was that of a fellow servant, for which the defendant is not responsible. It is not necessary to consider the remaining errors assigned. For the errors indicated, the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. Henry Schwabbe. No. 56. 1. Assumed Risk — Fellow Servants. — Plaintiff, an engine wiper, was injured while making a coupling at night, in a switch yard, between a road engine and a coal car, made in obedience to the order of H., who was foreman of the yard, with power to employ and discharge wipers, and who was operating the engine at the time. He backed the engine so hard that plaintiff’s left hand, which held the link, was shoved into the drawhead with the link, and mashed. A switch engine with sloping tender is generally used for yard switching, and plaintiff knew that a road engine was more dangerous, and knew that H. was a machinist and not a regular engineer. Held: 1. Plaintiff assumed the risk of making the coupling with a road engine and an incompetent engineer. 2. He was a fellow servant with H. 2. Care Required of Railway Companies. — A railway company, in the selection of its employes, and furnishing appliances to work with, is only required to use such care and caution as an ordinarily prudent man would use under like circumstances; therefore a charge which required the company “to furnish competent and qualified men to handle its trains at the yard, and to furnish means and appliances for switching trains which experienced railroad men had found were safest for that purpose,” was error. 3. Assumed Risks. — The charge that plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the ground that a road engine and not a switch engine was used, should have been given, because plaintiff knew that a road engine was being used, and the increased danger was patent, and he assumed the risk. 4. Knowledge of Incompetent Employe. — Plaintiff knew that an incompetent man was performing the work to be done. No amount of prudence on his part would relieve him of the risk; and the test is, not whether a reasonably prudent man might have undertaken the work, but whether the danger was obvious and apparent. 5. Careful Work by an Incompetent Employe. — If H. handled the engine carefully and prudently, as an engineer of ordinary care and prudence would have done under the circumstances, then plaintiff could not recover, though the jury might believe that H. was not well qualified for the work to be done. 6. Vice Principal — Fellow Servant. — A majority of the court is of opinion that under the facts H. was a fellow servant of plaintiff, and not a vice principal. In handling the engine, H. was not in the performance of any duty which the company owed the plaintiff, and the only reason for the position that II. was vice principal was that he, as foreman, had authority to discharge plaintiff. The difficulty lies in failure to separate the individual who handled the engine from himself as foreman. Appeal from Grimes. Tried below before Hon. Norman G. Kittrell. J. W. Terry and C. K. Lee, for appellants. 1. A railroad company is only bound in law to use ordinary care to select competent and qualified men to handle its engines and trains; and it is only bound to use ordinary care and prudence in procuring and furnishing the means and appliances for switching trains, etc., and to see that they are adapted for the purposes for which used. The charge complained of makes the duty of the railroad company in both regards absolute, and any failure therein in itself negligence; whereas, in law, the railroad company has discharged its duty to its employes when it uses such care and caution as an ordinarily prudent man would do under all the circumstances of the case, whether as a matter of fact incompetent men were or were not employed, and whether insufficient appliances were or were not furnished. It is not an insurer of the competency of the men or the sufficiency of the appliances; it is made both under the charge. Railway v. Wells, 81 Texas, 685; Railway v. Bell, 75 Texas, 50; Railway v.

The evidence shows that appellee, before undertaking to make the coupling, knew that the engine to be used was a road engine, and not a regular switch engine, and that it was not as safe as a switch engine; and so khowing, by entering upon the work, he assumed any additional risk incident to the use of the road engine, and is not entitled to recover on account of any unsuitableness of the same for the purpose for which used.

Railway, 46 Texas, 540; Bish. Non-Cont. Law, secs. 675-677. 3. If plaintiff was entitled under any view of the case to recover, it could only have been on account of the negligence of Housh in the operation of the engine, and this issue alone should have been submitted to the jury. When a charge submits questions outside of the case as made by the evidence, and upon which a verdict might have been found, a judgment based upon such verdict will be reversed. Railway v.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Sometime in May, 1887, appellant and appellees entered into a contract by which appellees were to procure loans for appellant upon country real estate in Clay County, Texas, upon the terms set forth in a rate sheet furnished them. By the terms of this contract, on all loans from $500 to $1500 at 10 per cent interest, appellees were required to obtain their compensation from the borrower; on loans from $1500 and over at 10 per cent interest, appellant was to pay appellees a commission of 2 per cent, and appellees could also obtain such additional compensation from the borrower as they might be able to do; on loans from $1500 to $3000 at 9 per cent interest, appellant was to receive in addition to such interest a premium of 1 per cent; on loans over $3000 at 9 per cent interest, appellees were to obtain their compensation from the borrower. By the terms of this contract appellant was to make loans upon such land in Clay County through no other person, and appellees were to procure loans upon such lands for no other company. The time for the continuance of this arrangement was not specified. The contract was made in Clay County, Texas. In the summer of 1889 appellant negotiated a loan with Byers Bros, for $60,000, and with H. B. Sanborn for $44,000, both secured by mortgage upon land in Clay County.. These loans were made through an agent other than appellees, and appellees instituted this suit to recover of appellant a commission of 2 per cent thereon as damages for the breach of said contract by it. To this suit appellant pleaded, that it was a foreign corporation, doing business in this State under, a permit from the Secretary of State, and that its principal office was in Dallas County, and that it had no agency or representative in Clay County, and claimed its right to be sued in Dallas County. Upon the trial, on this plea the court below instructed the jury to find against the same, and appellant’s first assignment of error calls in question the correctness of this action of the court. The twenty-first exception to article 1198 of our Revised Statutes, which prescribes the venue of suits, provides, that ‘ ‘ suits against any private corporation, association, or joint stock company may be commenced in any county in which the cause of action of a part thereof arose, or in which such corporation, association, or company has an agency or representative, or in which its principal office is situated.” To determine where a cause of action arose or accrued within the meaning of statutes of this kind frequently presents questions of considerable difficulty. Appellant contends that this statute has special reference to the place of performance, and that a suit could only be maintained in the county in which the defendant, by the terms of the contract, was to perform its part thereof; but we are of opinion that this construction of the statute is too restricted. By the terms of the contract these loans were to be secured upon lands situated in Clay County. The contract was made in Clay County. Appellees resided in Clay County, and it was contemplated that at least the greater part of their work would be done in that county. They were employed because they lived in that county, and were expected to solicit loans there. Appellant, by the terms of the contract, was to send its agent to Clay County to examine and pass upon the value of the lands upon which the loans were to be secured. Under such a contract, for a breach thereof we believe that the cause of action should be held to have arisen, at least in part, in Clay County within the meaning of our statute. Railway v. Hill, 63 Texas, 381; Phillio v. Blythe, 12 Texas, 124; Durst v. Swift, 11 Texas, 273. The evidence was undisputed as to the terms of the contract and the manner in which it was to be performed, and there was therefore no error in the court instructing the jury to find against appellant’s plea of privilege. Appellees also contend, that appellant waived its plea of privilege to be sued in Dallas County by answering to the merits of the case, and it must be conceded that there is an unguarded expression contained in the opinion in the case of Railway v. Traweek, 84 Texas, 69, which seems to support this view; but we are of opinion that the case of Railway v. Whitley, 77 Texas, 126, is more in point and should be followed. This case holds, that where these pleas are filed in due order, an answer to the merits does not waive a plea of this kind. As we understand the York case, referred to in the opinion in 84-Texas, it only decides the effect to be given to such pleading as an appearance when filed by a nonresident, and does not apply to the case of a foreign corporation having an agent in this State. In such cases the venue is prescribed by the statute above quoted. In making the loans to Byers Bros, and Sanborn, appellant acted entirely through other parties, and these loans were made at a rate of interest not authorized by the rate sheet furnished to appellees. By the-terms of the contract, however, appellant had no right during its continuance to make a loan of this kind at any rate of interest except through appellees, and in such cases, where application was made to it, it should have referred the parties to appellees to enable them to negotiate the loan and obtain such compensation from the borrower as they might be able to secure. There is evidence in the record which tends to show, that in addition to the rate of interest appellant was to receive upon these loans, there was also paid a commission to the agent through whom the same were negotiated. The court, after charging upon other issues in the case, gave the following charge on the measure of damages, which is complained of by appellant, to-wit: “If you find under the foregoing instructions, that plaintiffs are entitled to recover damage for the making of the Byers Bros, or the San-born loan, or both of them, then you will find for plaintiffs what would have been a reasonable compensation for the making of said loan or loans, had they been permitted to make the same.” As we understand this charge, and as the jury must have understood it, the court below held the law to be, that if appellant violated its contract in making these loans, appellees would be entitled to recover reasonable compensation (not measured b)r the terms of the contract) for making loans of that kind, even though they performed no service-in making-the same. As so understood, we believe the charge to be erroneous. Where one party to a contract is prevented by the other from earning profits thereunder, and the amount of such profit that would have been earned can be reasonably ascertained from the evidence, this will furnish the measure of damages. Railway v. Hill, 63 Texas, 381; Tel. Co. v. Bowen, 84 Texas, 476; Tel. Co. v. Brown, 84 Texas, 54. In this case, if the jury, under the evidence, should-find, that had these loans been referred to appellees, they would have realized the commissions that were paid to the agent who did negotiate them, or if the evidence should reasonably show that they would have been able to have obtained a greater commission than was paid, they should be allowed to-recover the amount that was so lost. In other words, we believe that the compensation that appellees would have been enabled to secure from the borrowers, had they been permitted to negotiate these loans, must furnish the measure of their damages for being deprived of the opportunity to earn the same, if this can be reasonably ascertained from the evidence. In 2 Sedgwick on Damages, section 670, it is said: “ The compensation of a servant or agent often depends upon a contingency. In such a case, where a breach of the contract by the employer prevents the happening of the contingency, he will not be allowed, by taking advantage of his own breach of contract, to prevent the plaintiff from recovering compensation altogether. If in such a case the amount of compensation can be determined, the plaintiff will be allowed to recover it, though, through the defendant’s default, the contingency upon which it was payable has not happened. Thus, whore plaintiff was to receive £20 at Lady-day, if he stayed till then, and the defendant wrongfully discharged him before Lady-day, he was allowed to recover the £20. Where a broker secures a proper purchaser for his principal, he is entitled to his commission, though the principal refuses to sell, or through defect of title can not convey. And where the broker was to have all he could get for the land over 8200, it was held, that he could recover what a proper purchaser, secured by him, was willing to pay over 8200, though the owner refused to sell. In Fairchild v. Rogers it was held, that the agreed commission could be recovered upon breach by the owner, on proof that the price named would certainly have been obtained, though the broker did not actually secure a customer. £t Where the amount of compensation which would be due under the contract can not be determined, the plaintiff may recover the value of his services. Thus, where the plaintiff was engaged by the defendant to train, enter in races, and ride the defendant’s horse in races for a year, his compensation to be two-tliirds of the net profits, and the defendant broke the contract, the defendant claimed that the measure of damages was two-tliirds of the value of the use of the horse for a year. The court, however, allowed the plaintiff to recover the value of his services, on the ground that the defendant had put it entirely out of the plaintiff’s power to secure remuneration at the contract rate.” Had appellees actually rendered service in procuring these loans, and appellant had wrongfully placed it out of their power to secure their compensation under the contract, they would be allowed to recover the value of their services to the time of the breach; but not having placed their right of action upon this ground, they must be restricted to the compensation they would have earned had the contract not been broken by appellant, and to entitle them to this compensation they must be able to show the amount with reasonable certainty. Wholly conjectural commissions can not be recovered. 2 Sedg. on Dam., 671. For the error in the charge of the court on the measure of damages, we are of opinion that the judgment rendered in the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance with this opinion. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 23, 1893.","The Equitable Mortgage Company v. Weddington, Slaton, and Sears. No. 100. 1. Venue of Suit Against Foreign Corporation for Breach of Contract.—A foreign corporation, having its principal office in D. county, made a contract with persons residing in C. county to loan money exclusively through them on lands situated in their county. The contract was made in C. county, and provided that the corporation should send an agent there to examine the lands to be offered for loans. Being sued in C. county for a breach of such contract, in making loans on lands there through other persons, the corporation pleaded its privilege to be sued in D. county. Held, that the cause of action must be deemed to have arisen, at least in part, in 0. county, and that the suit was maintainable there. 2. Pleading — Plea of Privilege not Waived, When.—Where pleas are filed in due order, an answer to the merits does not waive a plea of privilege. Following Railway v. Whitley, 77 Texas, 126, and distinguishing York v. The State, 73 Texas, 651. 3. Damages — Measure of, for Breach of Contract — Unearned Profits.—Where one party to a contract is prevented by the other from earning profits thereunder, and the amount of such profits that would have been earned can be reasonably ascertained from the evidence, this will furnish the measure of damages; and reasonable compensation, not measured by the terms of the contract, for services of like character to those that might have been performed, is not a correct measure of damage in such case.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Appellee, Harris, brought this suit in a Justice Court for the recovery of the value of a mule alleged to have been negligently killed by the appellant while in its use. Plaintiff had hired certain teams, with drivers selected and paid by himself, to the defendant for use in constructing a grade for a siding on its road in Burleson County. The drivers and teams were in the charge and under the direction of a foreman in the employment of defendant, who superintended the grading, and the owner had no control over them after they were carried on the works. A scraper was used, and the usual way of making a fill, and one less attendant with danger, was for the teams, after having the scrapers dumped, to turn back in the grade completed, and not in front of the fill, as was the manner of constructing the fill where the mule was injured. When the mule was hurt, the driver, under the direction of the foreman, was driving the mules down in front of the fill, and the scraper struck the end of a tie, was turned over, and fell forward on the hind legs of one of the mules, and cut them so severely that the animal died in a few days. The regular driver was not driving on that day, and the driver in charge was one suggested by defendant’s foreman, but he took charge of the team with the consent of the plaintiff, who was present. Plaintiff had been working on the track with his teams for several months, and knew of the danger that attended the employment. It was testified, that the mule was hurt the first time it started down the dump, but plaintiff knew of the manner in which the particular fill was being constructed, and had just left the place, and was not over 200 or 300 yards distant when the mule was hurt. It was in evidence that the foreman was drinking, but plaintiff knew of this also. The danger of the work was well known to plaintiff, and he was aware-of the increased danger that attended the manner of the construction of the fill on which his mule was injured, and he will be deemed to have assumed whatever risk there was. He ought not to recover. This conclusion is reached without a decision of the question as to whether or not the plaintiff should be affected by the contributory negligence of his servant-who was driving the team. As the case was tried without a jury, the judgment of the court below will be reversed, and here rendered for the appellant. Reversed and rendered. Delivered March 13, 1893.","Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. A. J. Harris. No. 215. Known Dangers to Animals.—Plaintiff hired teams to defendant, with drivers selected and paid by himself. After they reached the works, both drivers- and teams were under the charge and direction of defendant’s foreman. The driver in charge on the day the mule received the injury from which he died, took charge of the team with the consent of plaintiff, who was present and had been working on the track with his teams for several months. He knew of the increased danger that attended the employment, and the method adopted in making the fill on which his mule was injured, and will be deemed to have assumed whatever risk there was. Appeal from Burleson. Tried below before 1-Ion. John Alexander, County Judge. J. W. Terry and Chas. K. Lee, for appellant. 1. The-evidence shows that the plaintiff knew when he hired his mules to defendant that the work in which they were to be employed was dangerous, and he therefore assumed the risk incident to the same, and can not recover. 2. The evidence shows that if defendant, its agents, or employes, were guilty of any negligence in the conduct of the work it was having done on its roadbed, and in which plaintiff’s mules were engaged, and if said work was being conducted in a negligent manner and by incompetent employes, that all of such facts were well known to plaintiff, and that by permitting his mules to continue in said work under such circumstances, he contributed to the injuries received by them, and is not entitled to recover.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. The appellee, W. W. Van Pelt, brought this suit April 20, 1889, in the District Court, against the appellant, E. A. Bates, for damages to his homestead, one acre of ground, 75 varas square, fronting on Garden Street, alleged to be a public street of the town of Batesville, in Zavala County. The petition shows that plaintiff has but one way to and from his premises, by and on Garden Street on the east, and that defendant obstructed this way b)r digging two ditches, one in the street next to his lot, and one across the street near the southeast corner of the same, both connecting with the “ mother ditch” on the north. Plaintiff asks for $600 actual damages and $1000 exemplary damages, and prays that defendant be compelled to fill up the ditches and open the street. Defendant answered by plea in abatement, that the ditches were constructed by authority of the Comanche Irrigation Company, a private corporation, incorporated February 12, 1876, and that the ditches were for legitimate purposes of irrigation under the charter, and are the property of the company; that the corporation is still in existence; that its business is required to be conducted by its president and board of directors; that defendant is and at the time of the institution of the suit was president of the company, whose principal office, by its charter, is at Uvalde, Texas; that if plaintiff has been damaged as alleged, it was caused by the company and not by"" the defendant, who is not liable in his individual capacity, and he asks to be dismissed with his costs. There was no order making the irrigation company a party defendant, nor was there any order in relation to the plea in abatement, except to overrule the plaintiff’s exceptions thereto. The evidence showed that the ditches were dug for the irrigation company, as alleged by defendant, and were the property of the company. The verdict of the jury was for plaintiff for $100 actual damages, and “ that the ditches complained of in plaintiff’s petition be destroyed.” Judgment followed for plaintiff for his damages, and that the ditches complained of be filled up and destroyed, and unless this is done by the defendant in twenty days after adjournment of the court, the clerk is ordered to issue a writ to the sheriff requiring him to do so. Defendant appealed. Appellant insists, that the judgment of the court below is unauthorized because it requires defendant to fill up the ditches and remove obstructions over which he has no control or ownership. We think in this respect the judgment went too far and was erroneous. It is true defendant would be personally liable in damages for the wrong committed by him, and he could not defend the wrong by showing that he was acting for and at the instance of the irrigation company. Both would be liable for any tort committed by him as its agent, and the action could be maintained against each separately or jointly. Cool, on Torts, 133; 1 Beach on Priv. Corp., sec. 253; Railway v. Hackney, 83 Texas, 410. Ordinarily the company would not be liable for the malicious acts of its servants. 2 Beach on Priv. Corp., secs, 442-444. It seems from defendant’s answer that he thought the law would excuse him for the alleged trespass, because he was acting for the company in the discharge of his duties as its president, and that the company had a license from the State to clo the acts complained of, by its charter. A chartered company is liable for its torts, and has no more license to commit them than a natural person. The irrigation company was bound to so construct its works as not to trespass upon the rights of adjacent landowners, and its servants or officers committing such wrong would also be personally liable. Delivered October 26, 1892. But there being no controversy of the fact that the ditches were the works and property of the company, and that defendant had no control of them in his individual capacity, the court exceeded its powers in commanding that the ditches be filled up and destroyed. The petition asked for such relief, and when the answer by plea in abatement set up the facts the company should have been made a party defendant. The company was to be affected by the relief prayed for, and it was a necessary party. The court’s judgment was erroneous. On the question of jurisdiction, it should be said that the petition was sufficient to give jurisdiction to the District Court. There was no plea that the amount claimed was fraudulently alleged to obtain jurisdiction, and without such allegations and a finding sustaining them the court had the power to hear the cause and render judgment for any amount found to be due. Ratigan v. Holloway, 69 Texas, 468; Dwyer v. Bassett. 63 Texas, 274; 66 Texas, 58. Because of the error in the judgment, it should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded.","E. A. Bates v. W. W. Van Pelt. No. 17. 1. Joint Trespasser — Corporation and its Officers. — An incorporated irrigation company, its president acting for it, by its ditches injured the land along which they were dug. In suit against the president by an adjacent landowner, held, that the corporation and its president were both guilty and liable, and an action could be maintained against both or either. 2. Chartered Irrigation Company Liable for Injury. — A chartered company is liable for its torts, and has no more license to commit them than a natural person. An irrigation company is bound to so construct its works as not to trespass upon the rights of adjacent land-owners. Its officers and servants committing such wrong would also be liable. 3. Suit to Abate Irrigation Ditch — Parties.—While for the tort in so placing irrigation ditches as to injure adjacent land the officer superintending the work would be personally liable, yet in a suit to abate the ditch the irrigation company would be a necessary party. In such action, joined with one for damages against the president alone, it was error to order the removal of the ditch. 4. Jurisdiction — Amount in Controversy. — In the absence of 'a plea and evidence sustaining it that the amount alleged in the petition was fraudulently alleged to obtain jurisdiction, the court below had the right to hear and render judgment for any amount found to be due, however small such damages maybe.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellee brought this suit against appellant to recover damages, claiming that he had been wrongfully ejected from appellant’s train. The damages, which he claimed, were the amount of the fare from Wells, the station on appellant’s road, at which he was put off, to Tyler, the point of his destination; for'violence, insults, and indignities offered to him by the conductor in ejecting him; and the value of a pass, which he held, entitling him to ride over that road until December 31, 1908, and which, he claimed, was repudiated and rendered valueless by the action of appellant’s agents. Appellant pleaded a general denial, non est factum, and other facts, which will not be noticed further, as they are not involved in the points raised in this appeal. Verdict was rendered for appellee for $250 for the ejection, and $1000 for the value of the pass. During the trial, appellee, Scott, testified, that the road was ninety-eight miles long; that he intended to use the pass traveling over the road, as he passed over it frequently, getting lumber to use in building, in which business he was engaged sometime ago; that he had traveled over the road on the pass without paying; and that it would have been useful to him, if honored, until A. D. 1908. Appellee resided at Tyler, one terminus of the road, and the fare from there to Lufkin, the other terminus, was $5.90. At this point appellee was asked: “ How many trips would you have probably made over defendant’s road, per year, had it not revoked the pass?” Appellant objected to this, that it sought for the opinion of the witness, and that the witness should state the facts, and leave the jury to draw the conclusion. The objection being overruled, the witness answered: “I would have, probably made ten trips per month.” The court charged the jury, that in estimating the value of the pass, they should, among other things, consider the number of trips plaintiff would probably have made. This evidence of Scott is all the evidence shown in the record affecting the value of the pass. The ruling of the court admitting this evidence is the ground of appellant’s first assignment of error. The court, in its charge, instructed the jury, that if the agents of defendant used abusive language or insults to plaintiff, or offered indignities to plaintiff’s person or character, he would be entitled to recover damages therefor. Appellant’s third assignment complains of this charge, because there was no evidence to warrant it. Appellee, Scott, testified, that he got on the cars at Lufkin, and between there and Wells presented his pass to the conductor. The latter said that no such pass had ever been issued. Scott replied: “ That can not be so.” The conductor then said that the ticket had been scratched Scott insisted that the pass had been properly issued from the office; and the conductor again said: “ No, that pass is bogus; you will have to get off;” and threatened to put Scott off, unless he would get off voluntarily. Scott said that he would not get off, but would have to be put off, as he Was traveling on a good pass. The conductor waited until the train reached Wells, and then said to Scott, that he looked upon him (Scott) as a gentleman, and did not want to put him off. Scott again refused to get off; whereupon the conductor said he would take Scott by the arm and lead him off, which he did. The conductor advised with two other employes of the railway company as to the validity of the pass, and they agreed with him that it was not good. This is- all the evidence there is tending to show any misconduct on the part of the conductor. We are of the opinion that both of these rulings are erroneous. The question to Scott called for his opinion as to the number of trips he would probably have riiade in the future, had his pass remained in force,.and the proposed evidence is not embraced within any of the exceptions to the rule which excludes mere opinions of witnesses. No reason is seen why the facts upon which such opinion as the subject inquired about admitted of, could not have been detailed by the witness to the jury; nor why the jury could not have formed the opinion, after hearing the facts, as well as the witness. When this is the case, opinion is not competent evidence. Clardy v. Callicoate, 24 Texas, 172; 1 Whart. Ev., sec. 513. This evidence was well calculated to affect the verdict of the jury, inasmuch as the probable number of trips plaintiff would have made was to be considered by them in estimating the value of the pass, and there was little other evidence upon which they could base a verdict on this point. The evidence as to the conduct of the conductor in putting appellee off the car was not, in our opinion, such as to warrant the charge complained of in third assignment. While his ejection of appellee may have been wrongful, it is apparent from the record that he used no “ abusive language or insults to plaintiff’s person or character.” His claim that the ticket was “ bogus” and had “ been scratched,” contained no charge against appellant; on the contrary, he seems to have disclaimed any such meaning by stating that he regarded appellant as a gentleman. The jury probably inferred from the charge quoted that they were at liberty to consider the language and the conduct of the conductor as abusive or insulting. For these errors the judgment must be reversed. The second assignment of error, complaining of the exclusion of evidence offered by appellee, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments, attacking passages in the charge of the court, are not well taken. The exclusion of the proposed evidence was right, and the instructions referred to present correct rules of law for the guidance of the jury. Several propositions are stated in appellant’s brief under his ninth assignment. That assignment of error attacks the verdict of the jury as allowing excessive damages. In view of the fact that the verdict was based, in part, upon improper testimony, and found under an erroneous instruction, no opinion we might express upon it could serve any useful purpose upon another trial. No complaint is made of the measure of damages given in the charge except that above pointed out. Appellant, however, contends that inasmuch as the pass for twenty-five years was given appellee for an undivided one-half interest in land conveyed by him to the railway company, valued at the time at $2000, lie can not in this suit recover more than the value of his one-half interest in such land after deducting the benefits he had received in the use of the pass for five years. Delivered October 11, 1892. To this we can not assent. Whatever may have been the estimate put upon the land, he was entitled to the full value of that which he received in exchange for it, the ticket. ' If this was greater than the value of the land, he was entitled to the benefit of it. If he was wrongfully deprived by the acts of appellant of the use of the pass, before it expired, he was entitled to recover the value. Of course if the pass was never issued for twenty-five years, but for five only, he would be entitled to nothing. The rules given in the charge for determining the validity and effect of the pass are correct. This disposes of the questions raised by appellant that are likely to occur on another trial. Reversed and remanded.","FIRST DISTRICT, OCTOBER, 1892. Kansas Gulf Short Line Railway Company v. M. C. Scott. No. 2. 1. Opinion Evidence. — When the facts upon which an opinion is based can be detailed by the witness to the jury, and there is no reason why the jury can not form an opinion, after hearing them for themselves, it is error to admit the opinion of the witness as evidence. 2. Same — Example.—The value of a railway pass for twenty-five years being in issue, the owner was asked how many trips per year he would probably have made over the road if it had not been revoked, and answered, “ten trips per month.” Held, error to admit it'. 3. Erroneous Charge. — The conductor doubted the validity of plaintiff’s pass, and pronounced it “bogus,” and told plaintiff that he would have to get off, and threatened to put him off unless he would get off voluntarily; and plaintiff declining to do so, the conductor when .he arrived at a station took him by the arm and led him off. The charge was, that if the agents of defendant used abusive language or insults to plaintiff, or offered indignities to his person or character, he might recover damages therefor. The charge held not warranted by the facts. 4. Irrelevant Evidence. — Issue being as to the value of a railway pass for which plaintiff had given a tract of land upon which the depot stood, evidence of the increased value of other lands of plaintiff contiguous to the road by reason of the railway and depot being there was properly excluded. The price paid for a pass is not the true criterion by which to estimate its value. Appeal from Smith. Tried below before Hon. Felix J. McCord. The opinion states the case, except the charge referred to and the second assignment of error. The charge, so far as necessary to explain the opinion, is as follows: If plaintiff had a pass issued by the president of the defendant road good for twenty-five years, and that said pass was upon a consideration either good or valuable, plaintiff had a right to ride upon defendant’s train of cars as a passenger, and was not a trespasser, and defendant company would be liable for whatever damages plaintiff sustained by being put off, and it is immaterial that the pass says “ complimentary.” To entitle plaintiff to recover for the value of the pass, the proof must show that it was issued upon a valuable consideration; and if said pass entered into, as the consideration, or as a part of the consideration, for plaintiff to deed to defendant company the land described in plaintiff’s petition, and the defendant’s agents refused to honor it, then plaintiff would be entitled to recover for the value of the pass; and in estimating the value of the pass you will look to the time the pass was to run, the distance of the road, the facility it was to plaintiff to gó to different portions of the State, either on business or pleasure, and probable number of trips he might reasonably take upon said road. It is immaterial what the president of the road would or would not have done. If it was a part of the consideration for the deeding of the land to defendant company, and that was the contract between plaintiff and the board of directors agreed to, and the pass was filled out by the secretary under direction of the board, then plaintiff would be entitled to ride for twenty-five years, and the failure of defendant company to honor it would entitle plaintiff to recover for its value. The second assignment of error was: “ The court erred in refusing to permit the defendant to prove by the plaintiff that he had other lands lying contiguous to the land upon which the depot of defendant was located, and which land had been conveyed by plaintiff to defendant for depot purposes, and that the contiguous land was made more valuable by reason of the location of the depot upon said land.” Finlay, Marsh & Butler, for appellant.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On December 17, 1887, one George G. Koenig forwarded his application, affidavit, obligation, and first payment to purchase section 14, block 1, containing 640 acres of the public school land, under the Act of 1887 providing for its sale. This affidavit, application, and obligation were received by the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the land awarded to Koenig, to take effect as of the date aforesaid. Koenig’s application and affidavit represented himself as an actual settler, and stated that he desired to purchase the land for a home in compliance with the provisions of the act. The verdict of the jury, as we think upon sufficient evidence, establishes that Koenig was not a settler within the meaning of the law, and did not purchase for the purpose of making the land his home. Appellant Metzler claimed under Koenig. In 1888 appellee Johnson actually settled upon the land for the purpose of making it his home, as established by the verdict of the jury upon sufficient evidence, and attempted to purchase the same under the law in good faith for a home. Johnson forwarded all necessary papers to the Commissioner of the Land Office, and his first payment to the Treasurer, these papers being in form in compliance with the law under which he was seeking to purchase. The Commissioner declined to award him the land because of the previous sale to Koenig, and directed the Treasurer to return appellee’s money to him, which was done. Appellee has been in possession of the land, living thereon and cultivating it as a home, ever since he settled thereon as aforesaid, and in February, 1889, filed his petition in the form of trespass to try title against appellant Metzler, and thereafter made Koenig a defendant. The ease was submitted by the court to the jury upon the issue as to whether or not Koenig in good faith was a settler upon the land and purchased the same for a home within the meaning of the law. Verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of the appellee upon this issue, from which this appeal is prosecuted. From the foregoing findings of fact it will be seen that the first and most important question for us to decide is as to whether or not the fact that Koenig did not in good faith intend the land in controversy as a home, but was seeking to acquire it in fraud of the law, which allowed sales to be made to actual settlers only, could be taken advantage of by appellee after Koenig’s obligation and first payment had been accepted by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and before a forfeiture had been declared against him by the proper authorities. In other words, are the qualifications of a proposed purchaser of public school lands under the Act of 1887, and the subsequent compliance with the terms of his purchase as to the three years occupancy, solely questions between such purchaser and the State, or can they be inquired into before the issuance of the patent by others who may- wish to become bona fide purchasers in compliance with the terms of the law P We have had great difficult)' in solving this question to our satisfaction. A long line of decisions in this State has settled the law to be, that where the State has issued a grant, it alone can ordinarily have a forfeiture declared for a failure to comply with the terms of the grant. Luter v. Mayfield, 26 Texas, 325; Bowmer v. Hicks, 22 Texas, 162; Johnston v. Smith, 21 Texas, 729, and numerous other cases. And in quite a recent case the subject of the forfeiture of a charter granted a railroad by the State has been under investigation by our Supreme Court, and the familiar principle affirmed that a cause of forfeiture can not ordinarily be taken advantage of by a third party until the State has acted in the matter. Railway v. The State, 81 Texas, 595. The difficulty, however, is to determine as to whether or not these principles apply to the case at bar, and we have arrived at the conclusion that they do not. The law under which this sale was made provides, that “All sales shall be made by the Commissioner of the General Land Office or under his direction, and he shall prescribe suitable regulations whereby the purchasers shall be required to reside upon as a home the land purchased by them for three consecutive years next succeeding the date of their purchase. 1 * * * Any person desiring to purchase land in accordance with the provisions of this act shall forward his application to the Commissioner, particularly describing the land sought to be purchased, which application shall in all cases be accompanied with the affidavit of the applicant in effect that he desires to purchase the land for a home, and has in good faith settled thereon; and he shall also swear that he is not acting in collusion with others for the purpose of buying the land for any other person or corporation, and that no other person or corporation is interested in the purchase save himself. The purchaser shall transmit to the Treasurer of the State one-fortieth of the aggregate purchase money for the particular tract of land, and send to the Commissioner his obligation to the State, duly executed and binding the purchaser to pay to the State on the first day of August of each year thereafter, until the whole purchase money is paid, one-fortieth of the aggregate price, with interest from date at the rate of 5 per cent per annum on the whole purchase money; and upon receipt of one-fortieth of the purchase money by the Treasurer and the affidavit and obligation aforesaid by the Commissioner, the sale shall be deemed and held effective from the date the affidavit and application are filed in the General Land Office.” It will thus be seen that while by the terms of the law the Commissioner is to make the sale, yet there is nothing in fact to be done by him save receiving the application, affidavit, and obligation of the proposed purchaser. He is nowhere given discretion to accept or rej ect these papers. The sale is really made by the purchaser accepting the proposition made by the law. This proposition is one made to persons of a certain class, namely, those who purchase the land for a home and have in good faith settled thereon. No other class of persons have the right to accept this proposition made by the law, and even if the Commissioner desired to accept a proposition from some one who did- not propose to make the land his home, he had no power to do so in making the sale. The whole power of the Commissioner is exhausted when he receives the papers accepting the proposition made by the law. In submitting the case to the jury the court instructed them as follows : ‘ ‘ First. If George Koenig settled upon the land in controversy in good faith, and if he made application for the purchase of said land for the purpose of -a home, and if he so resided upon and improved the land at the time of plaintiff’s application to purchase, and if defendant bought said land from Koenig in good faith for the purpose of a home and with the intention of residing thereon, then defendant is entitled to recover. “ Second. If you find from the evidence that said Koenig did not settle upon the land in controversy in.good faith for the purpose of a home, or if said Koenig was not residing upon the land at the date of plaintiff making application to purchase and taking possession of the land in controversy, and if plaintiff settled upon the land in controversy under application to purchase the same in good faith for the purpose of a home, you will find for plaintiff.’ ’ The verdict in favor of plaintiff under the evidence established in effect that Koenig at the time he made application to purchase the land under the law above set forth did not do so in good faith with the intention of making his home thereon; and that he was not residing upon the land, and in fact had never resided thereon at the time of plaintiff’s attempted purchase, which was several months after Koenig’s application. Baker v. Millman, 77 Texas, 47. We believe, therefore, that the court was correct in holding that under these circumstances Koenig was not one of the persons who has a right to accept the proposition made by the law, and his false affidavit and application (as established by the verdict of the jury), with the execution of the obligation and making the first payment as required by the law, did not interpose a legal obstacle to another purchaser who came within the provisions of the law, and who proposed in good faith to comply therewith. Martin v. Brown, 62 Texas, 469. We believe the rights of different parties attempting to purchase the same land under the provisions of this law should be treated as being more in analogy to the rights of different locators upon vacant land previous to the issuance of patent, rather than upon the principles governing a forfeiture after the issuance of a grant, and we believe the courts have uniformly been open to the investigation of the respective priorities of persons of the first class. In providing for the forfeiture of land purchased under this law. the act says: “ If upon the first day of August of any year the interest due upon any obligation remains unpaid, the Commissioner of the General Land Office shall endorse on said obligation 1 land forfeited,’ and shall cause an entry to that effect to be made on the account kept with the purchaser, and thereupon said lands shall be forfeited to the State without the necessity of re-entry or judicial ascertainment; * * * and if any purchaser shall fail to reside upon and improve in good faith the land purchased by him, he shall forfeit said land and all payments made thereon to the State, and such land shall be again for sale, as if no such sale and forfeiture had occurred.” As to what would be necessary in a case where a settler had made his purchase in good faith under the law, and after residing upon the land for a time had abandoned the same, in order to again open the land for purchase under above provision of the law, we hardly think it necessary for us to decide, as the jury under the evidence must have concluded that Koenig never at any time intended to settle upon the land and make it his home within the meaning of the law. We believe, however, if the wording of the charge of the court quoted above should make a decision of this question necessary, the better opinion would be to hold, that inasmuch as the sale is between the law and the proposed purchaser, the latter should be held to a compliance with the terms of his purchase in order to hold the land from other purchasers, and as to whether he has done this or not can be contested in the courts until the final proof is made, upon the same principles that other attempted appropriations of public land can be so contested. The forfeiture provided for a failure to properly return the field notes of a survey under the Act of 1852, in order to open the land to other locators, is declared in language but little differing from the forfeiture declared for a failure to reside and improve under this act; and under the former act the right of a subsequent locator to contest in the courts as to whether it had been complied with was well settled. Upshur v. Pace, 15 Texas, 531; Johns v. Pace, 26 Texas, 271. If we are correct in the foregoing conclusions, it follows that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. The evidence is undisputed, that the appellee, Johnson, was a settler in good faith, and had complied with the provisions of the law so as to entitle him to the land if the prior attempted purchase by Koenig did not give the claim under him a better right; and we believe if Johnson had the right to make his purchase under the law, the Commissioner had no power to deny him this right by refusing to accept his application, and that this attempt to purchase on his part, coupled with his actual possession, entitled him to the judgment he obtained. Cattle Co. v. Bacon & Graves, 79 Texas, 12. Delivered October 25, 1892. We believe upon the whole case the judgment of the court below should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed.","Albert Metzler et al. v. J. O. Johnson. No. 11. 1. State School Land — Invalid Purchase. — K. purchased a section of State school land under the Act of 1887. Ilis application and affidavit therefor represented him to he an actual settler. He was not in fact an actual settler, nor had he purchased the land in good faith. Held, such purchase conferred no title on him, nor on his assignee, against one who afterward settled on the land and duly applied to purchase it. 2. Same — Forfeiture not Requisite. —Such purchase and sale did not interpose a legal obstacle to another purchaser who came within the provisions of the law. The first purchaser should be held to a compliance with the terms of his purchase in order to hold the land from other purchasers; and whether he has done this or not can be contested in the courts at any time before the final proof is made. A subsequent purchaser is not bound to wait for the State to obtain a judicial forfeiture of the prior fraudulent purchase. 3. Same — Possession and Tender — Trespass to Try Title. — J. actually settled on the State school land fraudulently purchased by IC. as above stated, and duly made application to purchase the same from the State, tendering the first payment therefor, which was refused because of the prior sale to IC. Held, that such possession and tender entitled J. to sue IC., and M., his assignee, in trespass to try title, and to recover judgment for the land. Appeal from Archer. Tried below before Hon. P. M.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. The appellant has a single assignment of error, which is as follows: “The court erred in holding that the property in issue, and claimed by the defendant in this case, was not subject to plaintiffs’ writ of attachment, and in rendering judgment for the defendant; because it appears, from the agreed case, that the plaintiffs were creditors of Eaton, Guinan & Co., who made the deed of trust to Marshall, under which he claims, before the execution and delivery of the deed of trust by them to him; that the property was seized under an attachment regularly sued out and issued upon plaintiffs’ debt, being a stock of merchandise theretofore held by said Eaton, Guinan & Co., and being disposed of by them as wholesale and jobbing merchants; that the firm of Eaton, Guinan & Co., and each and all the members thereof, were, at the time of making said deed of trust, wholly insolvent, and had no other property than that levied upon; that said debt and judgment rendered thereon is still in full force and effect; that the deed of trust exhibited with the agreement, together with the property, was delivered to the trustee, and the deed was immediately registered as a chattel mortgage; and it appearing from the deed of trust that the trustee was authorized to sell the merchandise so conveyed in the usual course of trade to pay off the debts scheduled therein, provided that if at the expiration of three months a sufficiency of the property was not sold to pay the debts, that the trustee, after having been requested by a majority in interest of the secured creditors, might advertise said property and effects for sale at auction; it appearing also that the most of said debts were already due, and it not appearing that any of the creditors named have accepted said deed.” Under this assignment, appellant makes the proposition, “ that as Eaton, Guinan & Co., having made a deed of trust, to secure certain preferred creditors named therein, to the claimant, John F. Marshall, on a stock of goods, wares, and merchandise, and said firm and its members being at the time of the execution and delivery of said deed wholly insolvent, and having no other property out of which plaintiffs could make their debts, and said deed of trust providing that said Marshall should sell said goods in the usual course of trade for three months, and until requested in writing by a majority in interest of the creditors secured by the deed of trust, and it not appearing that said creditors or any of them ever accepted said deed of trust, the same was void, because, in connection with the uncontroverted facts, the effect of the same was to hinder, delay, and defraud their creditors.” It is apparent that John F. Marshall, the trustee, accepted the terms of the trust, and in the absence of a repudiation of its terms by the beneficiaries, his acceptance will enure to their benefit. Bew. on Assign., 5 ed., 400, 401, 402; 1 Jones on Mort., 4 ed., sec. 88; Wallis v. Beauchamp, 15 Texas, 305. The main question in the case presented by appellant is, that as the deed of trust requires the trustee to sell the merchandise in the usual course of trade, its effect is to hinder, delay, and defraud other creditors, and for this reason the instrument, upon its face, should be held void, taken in connection with the fact that Eaton, Guinan & Co. were insolvent at the time of its execution. It is a well established principle of law that a debtor in failing circumstances may secure and prefer á bona fide debt of his creditors, although the effect of such preference would be to hinder and delay other creditors. The limitation imposed by law upon this right prevents the debtor from transferring to the creditor more property than is reasonably sufficient to satisfy the debt, and denies the creditor the right to give the debtor a moneyed consideration for the property in addition to his debt. In such cases, and in others that may be mentioned, the effect of such transactions would be to give the creditor the right to control and dispose of property not necessary to the payment of his debt, and to place the debtor in a position to hinder, delay, and defraud his creditors. The court can not determine from the face of the instrument that it will have the effect of defrauding other creditors. That can only be ascertained from the facts of the case. If it be true that the debtor has transferred to the trustee all of his property for the benefit of the preferred creditors, and the property is less in value than the debts secured, and the instrument permits a sale in due course of trade or otherwise, we fail to see how such fact is calculated to hinder and delay and defraud other creditors. It is true that the effect of such a transaction would be to hinder and delay, and possibly defeat, the claims of the unsecured creditors; but this is successfully answered by the law permitting an insolvent debtor to prefer a creditor when no advantage or benefit results to the debtor by such transaction, or the creditor gets no more than his debt. In appellant’s assignment of error it is admitted that “Eaton, Guinan 6 Co., and each and all the members thereof, were at the time of making said deed of trust wholly insolvent, and had no other property than that levied upon.” It is seen from the facts that the value of the property as levied upon by the writs of attachment in the several cases mentioned in the findings of fact is much less than the amount of the debts secured by the terms of the deed of trust. Under the facts, we do not see how the fact that the trustee can sell in the usual course of trade operates as a fraud upon the appellant, as it is apparent that a disposition of all of the goods is not sufficient to satisfy the claims of the preferred creditors. Delivered December 14, 1892. We find no error in the record, and affirm the judgment of the court below. Affirmed. Motion for rehearing refused.","The Bank of California v. John F. Marshall. No. 592. 1. Acceptance of Assignment. — When the trustee named in a deed of trust executed by insolvent debtors accepts the trust, in absence of a repudiation by the beneficiaries the acceptance will enure to their benefit. 2. Assignment Held Not Fraudulent. — Insolvent wholesale merchants made an assignment, preferring certain creditors, of all their property to a trustee, who was empowered to sell in ordinary course of trade, and at expiration of three months could be forced to sell at auction the residue on demand of a majority of the preferred creditors. The preferred creditors held claims largely in excess of the value of the goods so conveyed. Other creditors, by attachment, contested the validity of the assignment. Held, that the fact that the trustee could sell in the usual course of trade does not operate as a fraud upon the creditors not preferred; as it is apparent that a prompt disposition of all the goods would not have satisfied the preferred creditors. Appeal from McLennan. Tried below before Hon. L. W. Goodrich. This was a proceeding under the statute to try the right of property to certain goods, wares, and merchandise, levied on under an attachment sued out by the Bank of California, as plaintiff, against Eaton, Guinan & Co., from the District Court of McLennan County. Property was regularly levied on under the attachment, and John F. Marshall filed affidavit claiming the property, and gave bond to try the right to the same under the statute. The case was tried by the court upon an agreed statement of facts, on the 11th day of November, 1891, and there was judgment for the defendant, claimant Marshall, from which judgment the plaintiff appealed. The following is a written agreement, signed by the attorneys of the respective parties to this suit, stating the facts of this case, and the facts of seven others, which we adopt as the findings of fact in this cause: The following written agreement, signed by the attorneys of the respective parties, was offered in evidence: “Suits in the District Court of McLennan County.—No. 5002, Sweet Springs Milling Company v. John F. Marshall; No. 5003, Steinwender, Stoffregen & Co. v. John F. Marshall; No. 5004, The Bank of California v. John F. Marshall; No. 5005, The Fairbanks Canning Company v. John F. Marshall; No. 5006, Wm. Numsen & Sons v. John F. Marshall; No. 5007, Wm. Numsen & Sons v. John F. Marshall; No. 5008, Price & Lucas v. John F. Marshall; No. 5009, Church & Co. v. John F. Marshall. “ In order to facilitate a trial, we, plaintiffs and defendants in the above suits, agree to the following facts, upon which each of the above, causes shall be submitted to the court: “1. It is agreed that each of the plaintiffs was a creditor of the firm of Eaton, Guinan & Co. at and before the execution and delivery of the deed of trust to John F. Marshall, herein after named, in the several sums herein after set forth, for which judgments were rendered. “2. That by attachments duly and regularly sued out and issued from the District Court of McLennan in suits by said several plaintiffs on their several debts against Eaton, Guinan & Co., the goods and property described in the several claimants’ bonds were seized, and were, on the affidavits and bonds in the record, delivered by the sheriff to John F. Marshall, claimant; that said goods were a part of and included in the same conveyance to said Marshall by said deed of trust, and were of the values recited as the assessed values in said several bonds of claimants. “ 3. That the property conveyed by the said Eaton, Guinan & Co. to said John F. Marshall, trustee, and levied on by plaintiffs, was up to the time of execution and delivery of said deed of trust a stock of merchandise held and being disposed of by them as wholesale and jobbing merchants in Waco, Texas. “ 4. That said Eaton, Quinan & Co., and each and all the members of said firm, were at the time of the execution and delivery of said deed of trust wholly insolvent, and had no other property out of which plaintiffs could make their debts. “ 5. That said Eaton, Quinan & Co. were still and are so indebted to the several plaintiffs in the amounts of the judgments rendered in said several attachment suits against them, wherein said property was claimed by said Marshall, as follows: “ (1) Steinwender, Stoffregen & Co., judgment June 14, 1889, $4564.80 and 8 per cent per annum thereon from date. “ (2) Bank of California, judgment for $6784.56, June 10, 1889, with interest at 8 per cent per annum from date. “ (3) Fairbanks Canning Company, judgment for $1092.54, June 3, 1889, interest at 8 per cent per annum from this date. “ (4) Wm. Numsen & Sons, judgment in No. 4859 for $1747.60 and 8 per cent per annum from date, dated June 10, 1889. “ (5) Wm. Numsen & Sons, judgment in No. 4868 for $807.74 and 8 per cent per annum from date, June 3, 1889. “ (6) Price & Lucas, judgment for $875.16 on June 3, 1889, with 8 per cent per annum from date. “ (7) Church & Co., judgment for $974.03, October 11, 1889, interest at 8 per cent per annum from date. “ (8) Sweet Springs Milling Company, judgment for $1558 on June 3, 1889, interest at 10 per cent per annum from date, which is entitled to a credit of $437.85 on date of judgment. “In all which cases there was judgment for costs, which it is agreed shall be shown by the fee books, except in last case, in which costs were paid. “ It is admitted that in each of these cases judgment was rendered foreclosing plaintiff’s attachment lien on the property levied on, subject to the claim of said John F. Marshall. “6. It is agreed that the deed of trust, a copy of which is hereto attached, was executed and delivered to said John F. Marshall, and that possession of the property was delivered to him at the time of said delivery of the deed, which was immediately registered properly as a chattel mortgage, and that he was so in possession when the bonds of the several plaintiffs were made, and that he claims the title and possession of said property only by virtue of said conveyance. “ It is further agreed that the writs of attachment of several plaintiffs were sued out at the time and for the amounts and levied as alleged in plaintiff’s tender of issues. “8. It is admitted and agreed that said Eaton, Quinan, & Co. were, at and before the execution of the deed of trust by them to John F. Marshall, indebted to the several creditors therein named in the amounts therein recited, but this is without prejudice to the right of plaintiffs to assail the validity of said debts in any other suit.’ ’ “ The State of Texas, McLennan County. — Know all men by these presents, that we, John C. Eaton, Michael Guinan, and Walter A. Malin, of the city of Waco, McLennan County, State of Texas, are merchants and partners, engaged in the wholesale grocery and provision trade in said city, under the firm name Eaton, Guinan & Co.; and said Walter A. Malin has always used in connection with said business the name of his wife, N. Malin, by reason of the first money put in as share in the capital stock of said firm being her separate means; but by sales and investments of the proceeds of the commodities first purchased said interest or right of property in said firm has become and now is the community property of said Walter A. Malin and N. Malin, said share being the share of said Malin. “And we, John C. Eaton, Michael Guinan, and Walter A. Malin, composing said partnership or firm of Eaton, Guinan & Co., for and in consideration of one dollar to us in hand paid, and for the further considerations herein after stated, have bargained, sold, transferred, and conveyed and delivered, and do by these presents sell, transfer, convey, and deliver to John F. Marshall, of the city of Waco, McLennan County,. Texas, all our goods, wares, merchandise, and commodities which usually constitute a stock of wholesale groceries, and everything now constituting our stock in trade of every kind which are -in the store house or place of business now occupied by us, situated on South Fourth Street in said city of Waco, and all our office furniture, safe, show-cases, scales for weighing, and everything or implement used by us in connection with said business, which are in said store house; also one candy works or plant, and all tools, apparatus, and implements connected therewith which are now in said store house; and all fireworks and commodities in store in a barn situated on the lots occupied by John C. Eaton as a homestead in said city. “ But this conveyance in sale is made to said John F. Marshall in trust and for the purposes following, viz.: We are indebted as partners aforesaid to the corporations, firms, and persons in the manner and by the means shown herein after, and are desirous of securing payment to them of all we so owe them. The corporations, firms, and persons, and the amounts we so owe, and the evidence of said indebtedness, and the residences of our said creditors, is here stated: “ To Waco State Bank of said Waco, Texas, by our notes, as follows, made payable to said bank: One note dated August 25, 1888, due on demand, for 86500; one note dated December 20, 1887, due at ninety days, for 84250; one note dated November 2, 1888, due at sixty days, for 8855; one note for 82024.71, dated October 22, 1888, at thirty days; one note dated October 20, 1888, and due at one month, for $7500; and each bearing interest at 12 per cent per annum after date. “ To J.

And said Mrs. Malin, wife of Walter A. Malin, for the purposes and considerations, uses, and trusts stated above, joins in this conveyance, and does hereby convey to John F. Marshall all her right, title, and interest in all of said property stated above, in the same manner and to the same extent as the said Eaton, Guinan, and Walter A. Malin have done hereby. “ Said John F. Marshall is to take immediate possession of the property and effects hereby conveyed, and sell a sufficiency thereof in the usual course of trade for cash to pay off all said debts herein before stated, after reserving to said John F. Marshall 2-[ per cent commission on the amount realized by such sales, and also a sufficiency to pay all expenses of sale and executing this trust, and the rent of store house; and after having sold a sufficiency to pay off said debts, commissions, expenses, and rent, not exceeding $150 per month, of store house during the time occupied by him and in which said property is kept, and while making said sale, then the remainder of said property and effects are to be returned to us, and this conveyance or instrument is to be of no further effect. And if upon the expiration of three months from this date a sufficiency be not sold for the purposes aforesaid, said John F. Marshall shall, after being so requested to do by writing, signed by a majority in interest of said creditors, advertise said property and effects for sale at auction for cash at such place as he may select in the city of Waco. Said advertisement shall be printed, and shall state the time, place, and terms of sale, and one shall be posted at the court house door of said county of McLennan, and at two other and different public places in said county, for ten days previous to said sale; and shall sell only a sufficiency to realize such deficit as there may be for the payments, commissions, and expenses aforesaid, and rent. And then the remainder of said property and effects is to be returned to us, and this instrument is to be of no further effect and null and void when all before stated is paid. And in case said trustee, John F. Marshall, may become unable or unwilling to execute this trust, a majority of our said creditors in interest ""may, by a proper writing by them signed, appoint some other competent and suitable person to execute the same, with the same powers and limitations herein given to said John F. Marshall.” This deed of trust was properly signed and acknowledged by the members of the firm of Eaton, Guinan & Co., December 1, 1888, and was properly and duly recorded. We also find that the total value of the goods levied upon in the several suits mentioned in the agreement of the parties to be the sum of $22,136.29, as shown by the estimate of the officer levying the writs of attachment. That $44,911.67 is- the total amount of the debts secured by the deed of trust. [This statement accompanied the opinion.] L. C. Alexander, for appellant. Eaton, Guinan & Co. having made a deed of trust, to secure certain preferred creditors named therein, to the claimant John F. Marshall, on a stock of goods, and said firm and its members being at the time of the execution of said deed wholly insolvent, and having no other property out of which plaintiffs could make their debts, and said deed of trust providing that said Marshall should sell said goods in the usual course of trade for three months, and until requested in writing by a majority in interest of the creditors secured by the deed of trust, and it not appearing that said creditors or any of them ever accepted said deed of trust, the same was void, because in connection with the uncontroverted facts the effect of the same was to hinder, delay, and defraud their creditors.

Eaton, Guinan & Co., being bona fide indebted to the persons and firms named in the deed of trust, and intending thereby to secure such creditors in the payment of their debts, had the legal right to secure them by said deed of trust, and this irrespective of the question of the solvency or insolvency of said Eaton, Guinan & Co. at the time of executing said deed of trust.

Milling Co., 79 Texas, 404. 2. The provision in the deed of trust conferring the power on the trustee to sell a sufficient amount of the goods in the usual course of trade, for cash, to pay the secured indebtedness, when it is conceded to be a wholesale stock, and when a limit for three months for a sale in such manner is provided for, does not make the deed on its face, and from this circumstance alone, fraudulent as to creditors. Jackson v. Harby, 65 Texas, 714; Haas v. Kraus, 75 Texas, 108. 3. Where a deed of trust secures a conceded valid debt to a creditor or creditors, the fact that a discretionary power is conferred on the trustee by the terms of the instrument as to a sale of the property can not have the effect to delay and hinder other creditors, for the reason the property conveyed is subject to legal process, notwithstanding the deed of trust, upon paying off such bona fide debts secured, and there can be imputed to such transaction no claim that it delays and hinders creditors. In such cases, if the value of the property is greater than the secured debt, and if such secured debt is bona fide, then the property in the hands of the trustee is subject to legal process at once, subject only to the first lien holder’.s rights.

Possession of the property named in the deed of trust from Eaton, Guinan & Co. to John F. Marshall having been taken by said Marshall, for the purpose of paying conceded valid and bona fide claims of said Eaton, Guinan & Co., constituted a pledge of said property in Marshall’s hands for the payment of the debts named in the deed of trust, and therefore said property was not subject to be taken from Marshall’s possession on plaintiff’s attachment without the payment of said debts for which said property stood pledged.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. Naumberg, Krause, Lauer & Co. were judgment creditors of G-. B. Hull by virtue of a judgment of the County Court of Grayson County, dated February 6, 1889, for the principal sum of $392.15. This judgment was duly and legally fixed as a lien upon the real estate of Hull, by abstract filed on June 1 and August 1, 1889, and recorded and indexed as provided by law. The Martin Clothing Company was also a creditor of G. B. Hull by virtue of a judgment of the County Court of Grayson County, dated February 6, 1889, for the principal sum of $616.16. This judgment was also duly and legally fixed as a lien upon the real estate of Hull, by abstract filed February 6, 1889, and recorded and indexed as required by law. G. B. Hull was at the dates named the owner of certain real estate in the town of Pottsboro, occirpied by himself and his wife Julia and their family; and also of a certain business lot and store building which had been used by him while pursuing the occupation of a merchant, but which at the dates named was rented out to others engaged in the mercantile business. This suit was instituted in the District Court of Grayson County by Naumberg, Krause, Lauer & Co. against G. B. Hull and his wife Julia, the Martin Clothing Company being made a party defendant. Plaintiffs alleged their judgment and judgment lien upon the property referred to. They alleged that Mrs. Julia Hull was setting up title to the property; that G. B. Hull, through himself or his tenants, was in possession thereof; and that defendants named were falsely claiming it to be their homestead. They also alleged that the Martin Clothing Company was claiming a judgment lien against the property, which, if it existed, was inferior to plaintiffs’ lien. They prayed that their lien be decreed to be superior to that of the Martin Clothing Company; that it be declared and foreclosed against all the parties; that an order of sale issue; and for writ of possession and for general relief. The Martin Clothing Company answered, asserting its lien and the priority thereof to the lien of plaintiffs. It alleged that the defendants Hull were asserting a fraudulent homestead claim to the property described in plaintiffs’ petition. It prayed for the recognition of its judgment lien as prior to that of plaintiffs, and that the property described be subjected to its lien, and for its order of sale and for general relief. The defendants G. B. and Julia Hull urged a general demurrer and divers special exceptions, and pleaded the homestead exemption. The court overruled the demurrers; adjudged that the property on which defendants lived was exempt as their homestead, and as to it found for defendants; decreed the business house and lot to be subject to the judgment liens; adjudged the amount of plaintiffs’ judgment to be $429.47 with 8 per cent interest, and that of the Martin Company to be $684 with 10 per cent interest; adjudged the lien of the Martin Company to be superior to that of the plaintiffs; foreclosed the liens on the property found to be subject to execution, awarding an order of sale and a writ of possession. From this judgment Gf. B. Hull and wife appeal. Appellants strenuously insist that upon the facts disclosed by the petition this suit can not be maintained; that it is an action of debt on a judgment which was not dormant and which had not lost its lien under the statute.; that the judgment lien being general will not support an action for foreclosure upon a specific tract of land; that the judgment creditor can not (as he seeks to do) invoke the equity powers of the court against any particular tract of land, but that he must resort in the first instance to the process of execution, levy, and sale; that the judgments involved having been rendered by the County Court, the District Court is without jurisdiction to enforce or foreclose liens securing the judgment of a court of inferior jurisdiction. It is true that this case presents the features involved and criticised in the foregoing propositions, but it is something more than a suit for the purposes named. It involves an inquiry into the homestead claim alleged to be false and pretended, which consequenty burdens the property that plaintiffs claim to be subject to their judgment lien, and which, unless removed, impairs the efficacy of the lien. By this action plaintiffs in effect seek to have this homestead claim held for nought. It has been held by our Supreme Court that a creditor having a judgment lien against the real estate of a debtor may maintain a suit to assert such lien against his debtor and another to whom the property had been fraudulently conveyed, without in the first instance procuring execution and levy. Lynn v. Le Gierse, 48 Texas, 138; Cassaday v. Anderson, 53 Texas, 536; Gaines v. Bank, 64 Texas, 18. An equitable proceeding is justified under such circumstances, on the ground that the conveyance beclouds the title, depreciates the property, and thus, uncancelled, impedes the creditor from realizing on his judgment. We think that the effect of the fraudulent homestead claim would be the same as in the case of a fraudulent conveyance, and that it would equally justify a resort to equity. Nor is this conclusion affected by the fact that in this instance the judgments sought to be enforced emanated from a County instead of a District Court. They were nevertheless liens upon the real estate of the defendant Hull, and their efficacy was impaired (if the plaintiffs’ allegations were true) by the fraudulent homstead claim of the defendants. The homestead claim is a claim to an estate in land, and a suit to hold it for nought and to subject the property to a judgmen! lien, which, as we understand, is the nature of this proceeding, is properly brought in the District Court. If the plaintiffs had adopted the method suggested by the appellants, and had purchased the property at execution sale under their judgment, they would then in an action of trespass to try title have had to test the validity of their judgment and of their lien and the merits of the defendants’ homestead claim. We see no good reason why, in the first instance, they can not in the same tribunal test the same questions by the simpler and less expensive means here pursued. We are thus brought to the complaint that the court erred in finding against the homestead claim of the defendants with reference to the business house and lot involved. This property consisted of a lot and a two-story stone building. It was separated from the residence property adjudged to the defendants. G-. B. Hull had been pursuing the business of a merchant in this building. In December, 1888, he became embarrassed and sold his stock of goods to Schneider Bros. & Co. At this time (December 15, 1888) he leased the lower story of his building to his vendees until January, 1889. He then leased a part of this story to one Neff for the year 1889, and a portion to the United States postmaster for an indefinite period, rent payable monthly. The upper story he rented to the Masonic lodge for a term of five years, beginning January 1, 1889. He himself after the sale engaged in the occupation of a drayman. The defendant stated that when he sold his merchandise and rented his store house he did not intend to abandon it as a place of business; that he expected to resume business “as soon as he was able to do so;” that this ability depended upon his realizing upon notes and accounts due him, which he reasonably expected to collect, and also upon a remittance of $2000 expected by his wife from her father’s estate in Tennessee; that the money to be thus collected he would apply to his debts, when he would again resume business in the store house, which he still claimed as his business homestead. It was shown that at this time the defendant’s debts amounted to $1795, and the evidence indicated that the notes and accounts referred to were against insolvent parties. When the defendant sold his stock of merchandise he ceased altogether to follow that business. The property was not thereafter in any sense used by him as a place to follow the occupation or calling of the head of a family. The only specific business in which he thereafter engaged was that of drayman, in connection with which the property was in no way used and to which it was not adapted. We do not think that the mere intention to again resume business in this property at an indefinite time in the future, dependent upon a contingency which might never happen, could retain and perpetuate in it the homestead character. Such an intention is immaterial. Shryock v. Latimer, 57 Texas, 674; Pfeiffer v. McNatt, 74 Texas, 640; Hill v. Hill’s Estate, 19 S. W. Rep., 75. Delivered November 23, 1892. The judgment will therefore be affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Head did not sit in this case.","G. B. Hull et al. v. Naumberg, Krause, Lauer & Co. et al. No. 9. 1. Judgment Lien — Suit to Enforce. — Where a judgment rendered in the County Court has, by abstract duly filed, become a lien on the real estate of the debtor, the judgment creditor may, without first resorting to execution and levy, maintain an action in the District Court to cancel a claim of homestead set up by the debtor, and. to enforce the judgment lien against the real estate so claimed as exempt. 2. Homestead Exemption — Place of Business — Abandonment.— One who has sold his stock of merchandise, rented out his store house, and engaged in a different business, is not entitled to claim exemption of such store house as his place of business because of a mere intention to again resume business as a merchant in such house at an indefinite time in the future, and dependent on a contingency that might not happen.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. In the trial below of this case, which is an action of trespass to try title by appellees, to recover of appellants the east half of the Fred Schrack one-third of a league of land in Madison County, both parties claimed under S. R. Walker, and appellees relied on the following evidences of title: Deed from S. R. Walker to J. L. Garwood, August 2, 1870, first recorded September 27, 1870, and recorded a second time February 24, 1890, the first record having been burned in 1873. Deed from Garwood to T. W. House, July 10, 1875, recorded December 20, 1875. Inheritance of appellees from T. W. House, whose heirs they are shown to be. Appellants’ chain of title is as follows: Power of attorney from the heirs of S. R. Walker (coupled with an interest) to G. A. Steinle, November 2, 1889, recorded December 4, 1889, authorizing sale and conveyance of the land in suit. Deed from such heirs by Steinle, attorney in fact, to S. R. L. Cremer, December 27, 1889. Deed from Cremer to W. L. Thulemeyer, December 20, 1890. Appellant Berry claims under Thulemeyer. Appellants also relied on proof, offered by them, that Cremer bought from Walker’s heirs for a valuable consideration, without notice of the prior conveyance from Walker to Garwood. As will be seen from the above statement, when Cremer received his deed the record of Garwood’s deed had been burned, and it had not been rerecorded. Appellees relied upon circumstances to show that Cremer was chargeable with notice of their title; and further, that Steinle and Thulemeyer, knowing that appellees had the title to the land, entered into a conspiracy to deprive them of it and to acquire it for themselves, through the medium of Cremer, an ostensibly innocent purchaser. The court below found in appellees’ favor upon the latter ground, holding, that while Cremer denied knowledge of the title in them, and paid Steinle $150 in cash, and gave him two notes for $995 each, for the land, he was in fact an instrument used by Steinle and Thulemeyer to thus take from appellees their property. It was shown, and the court found, that Cremer conveyed the land to ThuFemeyer for $300 cash and the assumption by the latter of the notes given by the former to Steinle, and that the land had since reverted to Steinle. There was other evidence upon which the court based its conclusion, and the question made by appellees is whether or not this finding was warranted by the proof. We have fully considered the evidence contained in the record, and have come to the conclusion that the finding in this particular is sustained. It is unnecessary, and would be unprofitable, for us to enter upon a discussion of the facts. The evidence as to the notoriety of appellees’ ownership and claim of the land in the neighborhood where it was situated was properly admitted and considered by the court. It was a proper circumstance, tending to show Steinle’s and Thulemeyer’s knowledge of the fact. Upon the facts found there can be no doubt that the judgment rendered was the proper one. The series of conveyances through which Steinle and Thulemeyer ultimately procured deeds to themselves is to be regarded as constituting a single transaction, characterized and vitiated by the general purpose which actuated them. The interposition of a third person, as one of their instruments, can not add any strength to their claim, whether he knew of their purpose or not. His purchase is to be regarded as having been made for them, and their knowledge affected the transaction to which he was a party. The principle that an innocent purchaser from one having knowledge of a prior unrecorded deed, and that one who buys from an innocent purchaser, though himself having notice, takes good titles, are fully recognized, but they do not control this case, for the reasons given. Delivered December 15, 1892. This disposes of the case and renders a discussion of the other findings of the court unnecessary. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed.","W. A. Berry et al. v. E. M. House et al. No. 57. 1. Conspiracy to Acquire Title — Case in Judgment. — Appellees had the superior title to the land sued for, but one deed in their chain of title, from the heirs of Walker to Garwood, was first recorded in 1870, destroyed by fire in 1873, and rerecorded in 1890. Appellants’ title was, deed from Steinle as attorney for the Walker heirs to Cremer in 1889, Cremer to Thulemeyer in 1890, Thulemeyer to Berry. Steinle and Thulemeyer were both land agents, with notice of appellees’ title, and in the pleadings were charged with a^conspiracy to deprive appellees of the land and to acquire it themselves; and it was claimed that Cremer was not an innocent purchaser, because he had bought on a credit and only paid $150 of the consideration, and gave his notes for $1990, which were afterward assumed by Thulemeyer, to whom he made a deed. Thulemeyer first tried to sell as agent of Cremer, and afterward as owner, and thereafter Steinle wrote to Berry that the land had reverted to him. Under these facts judgment for the appellees was affirmed. 2. Evidence of Notice. — The evidence as to the notoriety of the defendants’ claim and ownership of the land, in the neighborhood where it was situated, was properly admitted to show Steinle’s and Thulemeyer’s knowledge of the facts. 3. Conspiracy to Acquire Title — Intervening Innocent Purchaser. — The series of conveyances through which Steinle and Thulemeyer ultimately procured deeds to themselves is to be regarded as constituting a single transaction, characterized and vitiated by the general purpose which actuated them. No strength is added to their claim by the interposition of a third party, whether he knew of their purpose or not. 1-Iis purchase is to be regarded as made for them, and their knowledge affected the transaction to which he was a party. On the facts found, the rule that a purchaser without notice from a vendor with notice is protected, and a purchaser with notice from a vendor without notice is also protected, does not control. Appeal from Madison. Tried below before Hon. Norman Gr. Kittrell. Thé opinion, together with the following from the record, sufficiently state the case: Steinle and Thulemeyer are both land agents. Thulemeyer first tried to sell to Berry as agent of Cremer, afterward as owner, and later still Steinle wrote to Berry that the land had reverted to him. Cremer was 20 years old when he purchased the land, and lived in Austin. The twenty-first conclusion of fact by the trial judge was, that Thulemeyer and Steinle acted together in'a plan to put Cremer between them and the true owner, in the attitude of an innocent purchaser, technically. Whether he was knowingly a party to the plan or not I can not say, but incline to the view that he was. Soon after Cremer obtained his majority, Thulemeyer, with a full knowledge of all the facts, and as a part of a preconcerted scheme to unlawfully acquire the land, took a conveyance from Cremer, and assumed his notes. West & McGown, for appellants. 1. Appellant Cremer being abona fide purchaser for value, and without notice of any title in appellees, title was properly vested in him at the time of his purchase, and Berry and Thulemeyer, his coappellants, claiming under him, likewise obtained title superior to that of appellees.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. On the 19th day of March, 1891, Leon & H. Blum and others filed their petition in the District Court of Galveston County, complaining of 1ST. K. Fairbanks & Co., a corporation resident of the State of Illinois, in an action for damages growing out of the alleged wrongful sequestration of certain boxes of soap in Val Verde County, Texas, by which action plaintiffs were damaged in the sum of $1420. On the 9th day of April appellant, by foreign counsel, filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court, disclaiming the submission of itself to the jurisdiction of the court, and expressly denying the same, and showing that service had been had upon M. S. Ujffy, a resident of Galveston County, and denying the agency of the said Ujffy; denying further that it had any agent in Galveston County. This plea was properly verified. On the 21st of May the court entered an order quashing the service, but reciting that the answer constituted an appearance, and ordering the defendant to plead to the next term of the court. On the 18th of July judgment was rendered, without further service on defendant, in favor of plaintiffs for $1609.33, “as for their damages by reason of the matters set forth in plaintiffs’ petition.” On July 20 appellant (defendant below) filed a motion to set aside the judgment; which motion being overruled, defendant excepted and brings the cause to this court on appeal. The assignments of error present but two questions, which are: First. Did the District Court, by the filing of the plea attacking the service, acquire jurisdiction over the person of appellant ? Second. Could the District Court of Galveston County entertain a suit for damages for the levy of a sequestration in another county, when defendants were not residents ? 1. It is contended by counsel for appellants, that the decisions of our Supreme Court and of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of York v. The State and other like cases, do not reach the point here involved; and stress is laid in the argument upon the fact, that in the York case the defendant, after his plea to the jurisdiction had been overruled, demanded a jury, paid the fee, and had his cause placed upon the jury trial docket. But it appears from the opinion in that case, that neither the judgment of our Supreme Court nor that of the Supreme Court of the United States was based upon those facts. They clearly rest upon a construction of our statutes prescribing the effect to be given to the filing of an answer. This is illustrated by the following passages from the opinions of the two courts: Chief Justice Stayton says: “Under the statutes of this State all defensive pleadings are styled the 1 answer,’ and among these are pleas questioning the jurisdiction of the court over the defendant. In view of this fact, and in the light of the statutes to which we have referred, it must be held, under article 1242, Revised Statutes, that a defendant who files any defensive pleadings makes such an appearance as gives the court jurisdiction over his person as fully as would the issuance of a proper citation and its proper service within this State. * * * The purpose for which the appearance is made is unimportant, as is the intention with which it is made, if the act done is one which the statute declares is such as gives the court jurisdiction to render a personal judgment against the person appearing.” 73 Texas, 657. Justice Brewer thus interprets the decision just cited: “It was conceded by the District and Supreme Court, that the service upon the defendant in St. Louis was a nullity and gave the District Court no jurisdiction; but it was held, that under the peculiar statutes of Texas the appearance for the purpose of pleading to the jurisdiction was a voluntary appearance, which brought the defendant into court.” 137 IT. S., 15. It thus incontestably appears that it was the filing of a plea to the jurisdiction, and not the subsequent acts of the defendant, that was held to constitute, under our present statute, an appearance for all purposes. The quashing of the service upon the alleged agent in the present case did not destroy the effect of the answer which had been filed by appellant. That service was confessedly a nullity, as was that in the York case. It conferred upon the court no power over the defendant’s person, but that power came through the effect given by the statute to the defendant’ s voluntary act in pleading. The order quashing the service can not be treated as an adjudication by the court that it had not by the answer acquired jurisdiction, nor as a relinquishment of its power over defendant’s person, for it expressly declared that the answer constituted an appearance, and continued the case until the next term of the court for an answer upon the merits. The jurisdiction in such cases does not arise from the quashing of the service. A motion to quash which is sustained operates as an appearance to the next term. But an answer is also an appearance. It might be conceded that there was no motion to quash, in the sense of the statute; but there was an answer, which has equal if not greater effect. Since the decision in the York case, a number of cases have been passed upon by our Supreme Court, adhering to the rule there laid down. Kauffman v. Wooters, 79 Texas, 205, and 138 U. S., 285; Railway v. Whitley, 77 Texas, 126; Sam v. Hockstadler Bros., 76 Texas, 162; Life Ins. Co. v. Hanna, 81 Texas, 487. In the last case the pleading filed by the nonresident was, as in this case, an attack upon service on an alleged agent, denying the fact of agency. This was held to be an appearance. It is true the plea, or motion to quash, as it was called in that case, was overruled by the District Court. We can not see that there would be any difference, in the effect on jurisdiction, between the overruling the motion and the quashing of such a service, unless, perhaps, the court should adjudge that it had not acquired jurisdiction, and thereupon should dismiss the defendant. The power over the person of defendant attaches upon the answer, and not upon the order quashing or sustaining service. After carefully considering the brief and argument of appellant’s counsel, we can not distinguish this case, in principle, from that of York v. The State and the others cited, and must hold, in obedience to the law as declared, that the plea filed by appellant conferred jurisdiction over its person upon the District Court. 2. Being in court, appellant was subject to the same rules of pleading as other litigants. If the law fixed the venue of this suit in Val Verde County, it had the privilege of being sued there; but it was a privilege which, to be made effectual, must have been claimed either by demurrer or plea. Not having filed either, appellant waived its right, and can not now be heard to complain. Statutes fixing venue do not generally affect jurisdiction, in its proper sense, but confer privileges, which are waived when not asserted. The State v. Snyder, 66 Texas, 687. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 2, 1893.","N. K. Fairbanks & Co. v. Leon & H. Blum. No. 93. 1. Jurisdiction—Motion to Quash Service Confers. —Defendant, a foreign corporation, filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court, and denied that the person upon whom the service was made was the agent of the corporation. Be Id, to be such an appearance as gave jurisdiction over the person, as fully as would the issuance of proper citation and its proper service. Although the service was quashed, it operated as an appearance to the next term. Following York v. The State, 73 Texas, 652; 137 U. S., 15. 2. Venue May be Waived.—If the law fixed the venue of this suit in Val Verde County, the defendant had the privilege of being sued there; but it is a privilege which, to be made effectual, must have been claimed either by demurrer or plea; and not having filed either, appellant waived its right and can not now be heard to complain.

The remaining defendants. Walter M. Robinson, W. L. Robinson, and Alice Robinson, are sued as children of Catherine Robinson, the deceased wife of plaintiff. The plaintiff sued to remove the cloud from the title to 230 acres of land out of the Susanna Walker survey, in Collin County. He alleged that he intermarried with Catherine E. Barker, November 5, 1851, and that she died in June, 1880; that during the coverture he acquired the 'land in controversy, paying the entire consideration therefor, $1100, out of his separate means; that his wife had no right or title in said property, nor have her heirs; but that from the purchase of the property during the coverture arises the presumption that the land belongs to the community of himself and his wife, and so casts a cloud upon his title. He prays that a decree be rendered,vesting absolute title in him to the property and cancelling all claim of the defendants. The defendant Walter M. Robinson answered by general demurrer and plea of not guilty; that the land in controversy was the community property of plaintiff and his deceased wife; that plaintiff and his deceased wife were at her death, in June, 1880, the ‘tiwners of the land described in plaintiff’s petition, except the tract hereafter set out as the property of this defendant. In this connection, defendant prayed for partition of said tract of land (less the tract below referred to) between the plaintiff and the defendants. Defendant further pleaded, that improvements, which he itemized, of the value of $3150, were placed upon the land during the coverture, and with community funds; he prayed for partition of these improvements. Finally, this defendant pleaded that he is entitled to a tract of 55 acres, which he particularly described in his answer, of which 42 acres are a part of the land described in plaintiff’s petition. He alleged, that about the year 1872 the plaintiff sold and conveyed to one G-. W. Evans a tract of 60 acres; that Evans had paid a part of the purchase money and had erected improvements on this tract, of which he bad taken possession; that afterwards the sale of this land by plaintiff to Evans was rescinded in consideration of the refunding of the money paid by him and compensation for the improvements; that in February, 1873, plaintiff agreed with defendant that if he would furnish the funds for repayment to Evans, the plaintiff would give him the 55-acre tract in question; that defendant accepted said agreement, and that plaintiff, with means provided by the defendant, refunded the money to Evans and placed defendant in possession of the tract as his home, and promised to execute a deed to him, causing the land to be surveyed, fixing the bearing trees and the corners; that defendant, relying upon this gift or agreement, and with the consent of plaintiff, took possession of the tract about October 1, 1875, and has since continuously held open, notorious, and exclusive possession of the same, and placed improvements thereon (which he itemized) of the value of $3000. He pleaded the statute of three and ten years limitation as to said land. He prayed for specific performance of said agreement, and that he have title to said land against the plaintiff and all the defendants. If this prayer should be granted, he renounced his claim to the improvements placed upon the remainder of the land; if it should not be granted, he prayed for his interest in said improvements, and also for the value of his improvements upon the tract of 55 acres. The defendants W. L. Robinson, Alice Robinson, and Lizzie Lowry appeared by their guardian ad litem, and pleaded that the tract of land in controversy, with all the improvements thereon, was the community property of plaintiff and his deceased wife, Catharine Robinson. They denied the gift and agreement pleaded by their codefendant, W. C. Robinson; they alleged that if such agreement was made that it was void as a verbal gift; that the 55-acre tract was a part of the homestead at the time, and that their mother did not join in said gift or agreement. They prayed for partition and for general relief. The plaintiff, in replication to the answer of the defendant Walter M. Robinson, filed a general and two special demurrers and a general denial. The remaining defendants, Alfred K. Moore, W. A. Lowry, and Augustus Hooks, made default. Our conclusions of fact founded upon findings of the jury in answer to special issues submitted by the court are as follows: 1. W. C. Robinson and Catharine E. Robinson were married in 1851. 2. The land was purchased in 1856 for the purchase price of $1100. 3. The plaintiff paid $640 of the purchase money out of his separate funds and $400- out of community money. 4. Catharine E. Robinson died June 22, 1880, and the following are her heirs and representatives: Walter M. Robinson, W. L. Robinson and Alice Robinson, her children; W. A. Lowry and Lizzie Lowry, surviving husband and daughter respectively of Laura Robinson, daughter of Catharine; Augustus Hooks, surviving husband of Mary Robinson, who died in 1884, after her mother, Catharine Robinson. 5. Improvements placed on said lands (excluding the tract claimed by W. M. Robinson) amounted to $1030, and were community property. 6. W. C. Robinson made to W. M. Robinson an absolute verbal gift of the 55-acre tract described in his answer, which land was no part of the homestead. In October, 1875, W. C. Robinson put W. M. Robinson in possession of this land. W. M. Robinson has continuously since that date remained in open and notorious possession of the land, and has placed upon it improvements to the value of $800, in pursuance of the gift. W. C. Robinson, in the month of June, after possession had been taken by Walter M. Robinson, caused the tract in question to be surveyed and its lines and corners marked and fixed. The jury also, in its conclusions, found that 195 acres of the land described in plaintiff’s petition was the homestead of plaintiff and his wife Catharine at her death, and it is the homestead still. The court rendered judgment as follows: 1. It vested in the plaintiff, W. C. Robinson, title to T8T7„-, and to the other defendants (except W. M. Robinson, who has renounced his claim to the same) title to T2y\- of the land described in plaintiff’s petition, excluding the 55-acre tract claimed by Walter M. Robinson; and declared the land, less said 55-acre tract, to be the homestead of the plaintiff, W. C. Robinson. 2. It decreed that the improvements on the said land at the death' of Catharine E. Robinson were of the value of $1030; that they were erected with community funds of W. C. Robinson and his wife Catharine; and it ordered that “ one-half of the value of said improvements, to-wit, $515, be vested in the defendants, except the defendant Walter M. Robinson, and that the same shall be a lien on said premises in favor of said defendants in the said sum of $515.” It decreed to Walter M. Robinson title to the 55-acre tract claimed by him against the plaintiff and against all of the remaining defendants. Among other things unnecessary to mention, it decreed that R. C. White be allowed as guardian ad litem a fee of $10, “ to be taxed as costs against the defendant Alice Moore.” From the judgment so rendered W. C. Robinson prosecutes this writ of error. The first assignment of error is, that “ The court erred in overruling the demurrer and exceptions in plaintiff’s first supplemental petition, filed July 6, 1886, in reply to the amended original answer of Walter M. Robinson, filed June 25,1886.” This assignment, inviting a review of the court’s action with reference to several matters, without specifying the ground of error relied upon, is too general to require consideration. The propositions under it can not be invoked -to assist it. Wé consequently ignore it. Jackson v. Cassidy, 68 Texas, 282. In the eighth special issue submitted by the court the jury were instructed to state 1 ‘Whether or not W. M. Robinson went into the actual and exclusive possession of the land (claimed by him), and made valuable improvements thereon in pursuance of the gift (from his father to him), and whether or not he has since remained in possession thereof, and whether or not such possession has been open and notorious.” We have already set out the finding of the jury in response to this issue. It will be observed that the finding does not, in terms, use the word “ exclusive.” For this reason it is urged in the second assignment of error that the finding is not responsive to the issue, and that the court therefore erred in rendering judgment against plaintiff in favor of W. M. Robinson. No statement of facts is found in the record. A motion for a new trial was filed, but was never, it seems, called to the attention of the court. The court evidently construed the finding to be responsive to the issue submitted, and we are not prepared to state that the interpretation was incorrect. We think that the finding already quoted indicates, in substance, that the possession of Robinson was open, continuous, notorious, and exclusive. There is no merit in this assignment. The fifth assignment of error is as follows: “ The court erred in rendering judgment against W. C. Robinson, in favor of Alfred K. Moore, for any portion of the land or improvements in controversy.” Alfred K. Moore was a defendant, but, under the finding of the jury, was not an heir of Catharine E. Robinson. The judgment awarded to the defendants, except-Walter M. Robinson, T2-3g- of the land in controversy. This was the community interest of the deceased wife, Catharine Robinson, and as Alfred K. Moore was not an heir of Catharine, he should have been excluded from the decree. We regard the failure to exclude him as a matter of mere clerical oversight, which will be here corrected and the judgment accordingly reformed. In the eighth assignment of error complaint is made that the court erred in submitting to the jury the question of the value of the improvements put on the land in controversy by community property, as such value existed at the time of the death of Catharine E. Robinson. This land was claimed by the plaintiff to be his separate property. Defendants reply, that if such was the fact, certain improvements had been built upon it by money belonging to the community, and that they were entitled to be reimbursed for their mother’s share of the community applied to these improvements. It seems to be settled, that where a husband improves his separate property with the funds of the community estate, the wife, or her heirs, will be entitled to reimbursement out of his separate property to the extent of their share of the community; that their demand for such reimbursement is in the nature of a charge or an equitable lien upon the property so improved. Rice v. Rice, 21 Texas, 58; Cameron v. Fay, 55 Texas, 61; Roberson v. McIlhenny, 59 Texas, 615; Furrh v. Winston, 66 Texas, 525; Clift v. Clift, 72 Texas, 149. This issue, therefore, springs naturally from the contention of the parties. It is urged, however, that the issue was especially irrelevant, because the property was at the wife’s death, and still is, the homestead of W. C. Robinson, and that the latter, for this reason, could not be held responsible for the value of improvements, except, at most, according to such value as it might be ascertained when the homestead character should terminate. How far this question of improvements, in connection with this assignment, or with the tenth assignment to be considered, might be affected, if at all, by the fact that the property is impressed with the homestead character, we are not required here to consider. The pleadings nowhere raise-the question of homestead; and though both the verdict and the judgment declared the property to be the homestead, they, being without basis in the allegations, can not be held to affect any issue here presented. Hall v. Jackson, 3 Texas, 305; Denison v. League, 16 Texas, 400; Lemmon v. Hanley, 28 Texas, 219. The defendant Walter M. Robinson renounced his interest in the community estate. The court adjudged this renunciation to inure to the benefit of the remaining heirs of Catharine Robinson. It is contended that the father should have had the benefit of this disclaimer. The father had no interest in the community share of his deceased wife; her children did. The disclaimer by one of them, in the absence of special direction by him, would; we think, inure to the benefit of the remaining children of his mother. Alice Robinson, a minor defendant, was represented by R. C. White, guardian ad litem, to whom the judgment awarded a fee, to be taxed as costs against Alice Moore. This is complained of as error. As there was no such party to the suit as Alice Moore, it is plain that the entry of this name, instead of the name Alice Robinson, was purely a clerical error. This will be corrected, and the judgment in this respect reformed. The tenth assignment of error is to the effect that the court erred in rendering judgment against W. C. Robinson in favor of the heirs of his deceased wife in the sum of $515, and in adjudging said sum to constitute a lien on plaintiff’s land. As we have already pointed out, the jury found that W. C. Robinson had expended out of the community funds $1030, in placing permanent and valuable improvements upon a tract of land of which he owned an undivided interest of and his wife an undivided interest of ytü- Husband and wife were thus, in the proportion named, tenants in common of the tract in question, and on her death her heirs succeeded to her tenancy. Five hundred and ten dollars of her money had been by her cotenant applied to the erection of the improvements. Where one cotenant, with the consent of the other cotenant, places improvements of the character named upon property held in common, the latter cotenant 11 will be liable to contribute his just share with interest.” Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, vol. 11, p. 1106. In Freeman on Cotenancy and Partition, section 262, we find the following language: “ If a cotenant has assented to or authorized improvements to be made, he is answerable therefor, and a lien exists against his property for the amount thereof against him and his grantees with notice.” Here there is no question of assent or authority, because the tenant making the improvements is the one sought to be charged. As the head of the connubial partnership, he was authorized to use the community funds, with or without the consent of the wife. If, therefore, he used her funds in improving his property, the lien to the extent of such use exists in her favor against the property so improved, and the court was correct in so holding. Torrey v. Martin, 4 S. W. Rep., 642. We think, however, that there was error as to the amount of the lien adjudged by the court. Mrs. Catharine Robinson was the owner of an interest of of the land improved. To that extent her property must be held to have been benefited from the money expended, and she should be proportionately charged. Again, the plaintiff husband expended upon the improvements $515, his community share, from which the wife’s interest must be held to have received its proportionate benefit. To the extent of this benefit the husband should be credited. We could make the calculation and here reform the judgment, limiting the lien to the proper sum; but there are suggestions in the record that the behests of justice would probably be best subserved by remanding the cause on this issue of improvements and on the issue of partition raised by the pleadings, and the equities of the parties in connection therewith. Delivered October 18, 1892. We conclude, and so order, that the judgment in favor of the defendant Walter M. Robinson shall be in all things affirmed, and that he recover of W. C. Robinson his costs in both courts incurred; that the judgment shall be reformed in so far as A. K. Moore is in any sense a beneficiary therein, and in so far as it awards a fee in favor of the guardian ad litem R. C. White, against Alice Moore instead of Alice Robinson; that the findings of the jury fixing the relative interests of the parties in the 195-acre tract in controversy and T^¡- respectively) shall be deemed conclusive; that the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded on the issue of improvements and of partition connected therewith, and on the finding of the homestead, which was without support in the pleadings; and that on another trial the deliberations of the court or jury be confined to this issue of improvements and partition. W. C. Robinson will recover all costs incurred by him in this court from the defendants in error, except Walter M. Robinson. Reversed and remanded. Justice Head, did not sit in this case.","W. C.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This appeal is from a verdict and judgment recovered by appellee in the sum of $1000.25, for the negligent failure on the part of appellant to transmit and deliver a telegraphic message from Ardmore, Indian Territory, to Dr. Howard, at Sanger, Texas. On September 14, 1890, appellee and his wife having a very sick child at Ardmore, whose name was Maggie, and being desirous of securing the immediate attendance of Dr. Howard, who was a practicing physician at Sanger, and the grandfather of the child, determined to summon him by telegram. To accomplish this purpose, appellee on that day delivered to appellant’s agent, addressed to Dr. Howard at Sanger, the following message: “ Maggie is worse. Come at once.” He paid the usual toll, and informed the agent of the importance of the message and the relationship of the parties. The agent promised to transmit the message promptly, if not on that evening, which was Sunday, at least early the next morning. He hung it serenely on a hook in the office and no further attention seems to have been paid to it. The distance to Ardmore was about 60 miles, and there were two trains a day each way. Appellee met each of these trains for four days in expectation of the arrival of Dr. Howard. He did not send an additional message till the 18th, in response to which Dr. Howard, early on the morning of the 19th, arrived at Ardmore. The excuse for not sooner sending this message on the part of appellee was, that as Dr. Howard was a practicing physician, he supposed that owing to absence from home he had not received the first message. The child having steadily grown worse, was on the arrival of Dr. Howard entirely beyond the reach of medical aid, and died on the 21st of September. We conclude from the evidence contained in the record: 1. That appellant was guilty of gross negligence in failing to transmit and deliver the message. 2. That the absence of Dr. Howard for the space of four days was the proximate result of this negligence. 3. That thereby the mental anguish of appellee and his wife on account of the sickness and death of their child was materially augmented. 4. That this increased mental suffering did not result from contributory negligence on their part. 5. That the amount of the verdict was not in excess of a reasonable compensation for the injury sustained. The measure of damages alleged by appellee was compensation, not for the mental suffering which resulted from the sickness and death of the child, but for the superadded pain and anguish which resulted from the absence of Dr. Howard until it was entirely too late to afford any relief. This distinction was clearly made in the pleadings, to which appellant excepted, and also in the court’s charge, to which objection is made. We conclude therefore that no error was committed in overruling the exceptions to appellee’s pleading, nor in the charge on the question of the measure of damages. Tel. Co. v. Richardson, 79 Texas, 649. In submitting the question of contributory negligence, appellant contends that the court erred in limiting that defense to the conduct of appellee, and in not giving, as requested by appellant, a charge which included also the contributory negligence of appellee’s wife as a defense to the action. We find in the record no evidence of any contributory negligence on her part which would not show equal or greater negligence on the part of appellee. That is to say, the jury could not have found that appellee was free from contributory negligence without also finding that his wife was without negligence. We conclude that no injury resulted to appellant by the failure of the court to give the requested instruction on this branch of the case, the court having charged that the contributory negligence of appellee would preclude a recovery. We think the charge of the court as a whole contains a clear and fair statement of the law applicable to the issues developed, and that the several assignments of error complaining of charges given and refused are not well taken. The action of the court in overruling the motion for a continuance, and in refusing to require appellee to give a cost bond, was manifestly not to the prejudice of appellant, and hence the eighth and ninth assignments of error are not well taken. The assignments of error complaining of the incompetency and insufficiency of the evidence are likewise without merit. This disposes of all the assignments of error except the one which complains that the verdict of the jury is excessive. Appellant contends that such a verdict would not have been given against an individual upon the same state of facts, and that the fact that appellant was a corporation swelled the amount. We do not assent to this proposition. It seems to us that if a jury had not rendered a verdict under the same facts against an individual for an equal amount, that they might with great propriety have done so. The inherent difficulty of compensating for such an injury in money is fully realized, but the amount allowed in this case does not shock the conscience. The judgment will therefore be affirmed.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Appellant is a city of over 1000 inhabitants, incorporated under the general laws of this State applicable to such cities. Gandy Street and Houston Avenue are public streets of said city, recognized and adopted as such. These streets intersect each other, and at their intersection appellant placed two large flat stones, leading from the sidewalk to the crossing. These stones were somewhat inclined, were intended for use by pedestrians, and the verdict of the jury establishes negligence on the part of the city in the manner in which they were placed for such use, and also knowledge on its part of such dangerous condition. Appellant had for several months maintained a light at this crossing, but upon the night in question it was not burning. The verdict also establishes that on the night of May 80,1888, appellee, without negligence on her part, slipped upon the stones above referred to, and by her fall was injured in the manner alleged in her petition, from which she sustained damage to the amount of the verdict, which was $1600. There was a decided conflict in the evidence as to whether or not the construction and use of the stones above referred to was negligence on the part of the city, but under the well settled rules in this State, the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence on this point to sustain it. Appellant, in its first assignment of error, complains of the action of the court below in overruling a special exception interposed by it to appellee’s original petition, on the ground that such petition did not allege .that she did not have notice of the defective condition of the crossing prior to her injury, but on the contrary, affirmatively shows that she did have such knowledge. We do not construe the petition as showing affirmatively that plaintiff had notice of the defective condition of this crossing, nor do we believe that the petition was defective in failing to .aver affirmatively that she did not have such notice. The law applicable to this case is not that which pertains to the relation of master and servant, under which it is held, that the servant assumes the risk from defects of which he has notice, but it is to be decided according to the rules of law applicable to the duty a city is under in reference to its streets for the protection of the public, who sustain no contractual relation to it. In such cases, it is well settled in this State, that knowledge of the defect by an injured traveller, prior to the injury, is not conclusive evidence of negligence on his part. The question of contributory negligence thus raised is one for the jury under the circumstances of the particular case. Railway v. Gasscamp, 69 Texas, 545; City of Galveston v. Hemmis, 72 Texas, 558; City of Austin v. Ritz, 72 Texas, 391. In such cases, unless plaintiff in stating her case shows contributory negligence on her own part, it would seem to be necessary for the defendant to plead it. For a full decision as to the practice upon this question, see Murray v. Railway, 73 Texas, 2. Appellant pleaded specially in the court below, that prior to the time when plaintiff was injured, it had entered into a contract with the Denison Gas and Coal Company to furnish to it a certain number of lamps upon its streets, including the one at the crossing where the injury occurred, and that under such contract said company was bound to keep said lamp supplied with gas and burning while it was dark, and that if plaintiff had suffered any injury by reason of said lamp not being lighted, and if there was any fault at all in failing to have it lighted, it was the fault of the said Denison Gas and Coal Company, and it prayed that said company be made a party to said suit, and for judgment over against it. Plaintiff’s petition charged negligence on the part of the city in the use and construction of the stones referred to above, and also in failing to have this light burning, and appellant in its answer does not allege that the injury to plaintiff was caused solely by the failure to have the lamp lighted. The court below sustained a special exception to this answer, interposed by the gas company, upon the ground that it showed no right of action against it for damages appellant might be compelled to pay by reason of its default or omission concurring with other negligence on the part of the city to cause the injury to plaintiff complained of in her petition. We believe the ruling of the court was correct. Had appellant’s answer, in itself or in connection with the petition of plaintiff, shown that the injury to plaintiff was caused solely by the negligence of the gas company in failing to keep the lamp lighted in compliance with its contract with the city, we are not prepared to hold that the city would not have a right of action against such company for the damage it is compelled to pay appellee. This question is ably and exhaustively treated in the case of The City of Brooklyn v. The Brooklyn City Railway Company, 47 New York, 475. Also, see Chicago v. Robbins, 2 Black, 418: Robbins v. City of Chicago, 71U. S., 657; Cool. on Torts, 2 ed., 170; Armstrong v. Clarion County, 5 Am. Rep., 368; Railway v. Railways, 83 Texas, 509. It is not, however, necessary for us to decide this question, inasmuch as we construe plaintiff’s petition as charging negligence both upon the part of the city in constructing the crossing and in failing to have the lamp lighted; and under the charge of the court we think the jury must have found such negligence to have existed in reference to the crossing; and under these circumstances, it seems to be well settled, if defendant’s own negligence contributed in causing the injury, it can not have contribution, although its contractor’s negligence may also have contributed thereto. Railway v. Railways, supra, with the other authorities above cited. We do not believe the evidence fairly raised the issue as to plaintiff’s having been injured by stepping upon rocks not in the crossing of Houston Avenue and Gandy Street, and there was therefore no error in refusing the charge as complained of in the third assignment; nor do we believe the charge of the court to be subject to any of the other objections interposed to it. It will be seen from the findings of fact that we would not be authorized to reverse the judgment for lack of evidence to support it. The judgment of the court below will be in all things affirmed.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Trepass to try title by appellees against appellant, to recover the east half of 640 acres of land in Galveston County, patented to John S. Jones. Defendant pleaded not guilty. Judgment was rendered for appellees, from which the appeal is taken. Prior to the 4th day of October, 1888, the title to the land sued for was in H. L. Mathews. On that day a corporation called the J. L. Mott Iron Works recovered judgments against Mathews, abstracts of which were filed and recorded in the office of the county clerk the same day. In indexing the record of the abstracts, the name of Mathews properly appeared alphabetically indexed under the letter M, and the name of the plaintiff was given properly there, but the name of the corporation, when the clerk undertook to place it alphabetically upon the index, in the column of plaintiffs, was stated thus, “Mott, J. L., Iron Works.” Mathews had previously conveyed the land to his wife by deed, which had not been recorded, and of which the judgment creditor had no notice when the abstract of the judgments were recorded. Appellant claims under that deed. After the abstracts were recorded, the land was sold under the judgments and bought in for appellees. Their title, therefore, depends on the question whether or not the indexing of the abstracts was a sufficient compliance with the statutory provision requiring the name of each plaintiff and each defendant to be indexed alphabetically. We think it was sufficient. While the indexing is made a necessary step in the creation of a lien, and while a substantial compliance with the statutory directions can not be dispensed with by the courts, there is no reason why the purpose of those requirements should be ignored. The object is to afford a ready means of information as to the names of persons in favor of and against whom judgment liens upon lands exist. When the index furnishes that, substantially as the law provides, the purpose is subserved; and the statute should not be construed so technically as to impose unnecessary difficulties upon the judgment creditor seeking to secure liens upon the property of his debtor. The article “ the” is so habitually used in naming corporations, that it may be held, that for purposes like this it is not to be treated as forming any part of the name. It in no way helps to distinguish one body from another, for it is used in connection with nearly all corporations in the legislation of the day. The name. “Mott” is that which does identify this corporation, and seems more completely to do so than any other word in the name. The letters “J. L.” are evidently'the initials of some individual from whom the corporate body takes its name. It is not probable that a prudent person, searching in the index for the name of this corporation, would omit to look for-the name “ Mott” under its proper letter. The name of the judgment debtor, the most essential part of the indexing, is correctly stated, and in connection with it the name of the plaintiff is stated in full, as named in the charter. It seems evident therefore, that the index would give all the required information, substantially in. the manner designed by the statute. The recording of the abstracts therefore fixed a lien upon the property superior to the right acquired by Mathews’ wife under her prior unrecorded deed. When the judgments were transferred to Flanagan the lien passed with-them, and the sale vested in the purchaser the right acquired by the corporation, notwithstanding Flanagan and the purchaser may have had notice, at the time of such transfer and of the sales under executions, of the deed to Mrs. Mathews, and may have advanced no new considerations. The court did not err in admitting in evidence the sheriff’s deed, and holding that it conveyed a title superior to that of appellant. The fact-that the transfers of the judgments were made to Flanagan m order that he might plead them in setoff against Mathews does not affect the question. Affirmed. Delivered February 23, 1893.","John H. Burnett v. Virginia M. Cockshatt et al. No. 90. 1. Indexing Abstract of Judgment.—The abstract was correctly indexed, except that when the clerk undertook to place it alphabetically upon the index in the column of plaintiffs, the name was stated thus, “Mott, J. L., Iron Works,’’ when the plaintiff which recovered the judgment was a corporation called the “ J. L. Mott Iron Works.” This indexing was sufficient. While indexing is made a necessary step in the creation of the lien, and while a substantial compliance with statutory direction can not be dispensed with, there is no reason why the object of the index, which is to afford a ready means of information as to the names of persons in favor of or against whom judgment liens exist, should be ignored. This indexing furnishes that information. 2. Judgment Purchaser—Notice.—The judgment having been correctly recorded so as to create a lien, the purchaser at a sale under the judgment acquired the rights of the plaintiff in the judgment, and his title was superior to that of one who claimed title under an unrecorded deed which antedated the record of the judgment, although at the date of the sale such purchaser had notice of the unrecorded title, and advanced no new consideration.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellants’ first, second, and third assignments of error complain of errors in the charge of the court below. The portion pf the charge first complained of is, in substance, that if appellants were guilty of negligence in allowing the coupling apparatus of the car that caused appellee’s injury to become defective, and if appellee, without negligence on his own part, while coupling the car was caught between the cars and injured, defendants would be liable. This charge was erroneous in not including in the enumeration of the facts essential to a recovery the further fact that the injury must have resulted from the defective condition of the coupling apparatus. The same error occurs in the two paragraphs of the charge in which is defined the liability of the master for negligent failure to inform servants of extra hazards to arise from the use of a car of an unusual and more than ordinarily dangerous construction. In neither instruction is the fact that the failure on the part of the master to perform his duty in this respect must have proximately caused the hurt to appellee made one of the conditions of his liability. It can not be said that the evidence so conclusively showed that appellee was hurt by a defect in the coupling appliances of the car, or as the result of a failure of appellants to warn him of the unusual danger incident to the act of coupling it, as to warrant the court in assuming these facts to be established. The instructions should have been so shaped as to leave it to the jury to find whether or not either or both of them were proven. The charge in previous parts stated the case as one in which the plaintiff sought to recover for injuries received by reason of a “ defective car” ■and “ defective machinery,” and instructed, in substance, that if plaintiff’s injury was caused by a defective car, defendants would be liable, if the other facts essential to a recovery were shown; and it is claimed that this cured the errors in the subsequent and more specific directions. But the jury were not told here or elsewhere in the charge that appellants would not be liable if the defect did not proximately cause the injury, and the instructions complained of in effect charge them that liability would attach without proof of that fact. By the fifth special charge asked by appellants and refused by the court, the proposition that the alleged defect in the drawliead must have proximately caused the injury before liability could arise therefrom, was requested as the law of the ease. As this rule was nowhere contained in the charge, it should have been given. The nineteenth assignment of error is, that the court erred in instructing that “ if the defect in the car was latent and not known to plaintiff, and could not be known by the exercise of ordinary care, then the duty was on the master to acquaint him with the defect, if any exists.’ ’ The master would not be liable for an injury received by the servant from a latent defect in the car, unless by the exercise of proper care the master ought to have known of its existence. If he did know of its existence, or if he with proper care could have known it, his duty would be to remedy it rather than to warn the servant. He might escape liability by acquainting the servant with the fact, if the latter continued in the service and assumed the risk. But we can not see that this instruction had any proper application to the facts of the case. There was testimony that the spring of the drawhead was defective, and that some portions of the castings about it were broken at a date subsequent to appellee’s injury. These are the only particulars in which the evidence tended to show defects which might in any sense be considered latent. If these defects existed at the time appellee was hurt, and the facts showed that appellants knew or with proper care ought to have known of them, their duty was, as before stated, to repair them; and their failure to inform appellee of these conditions could neither increase nor diminish their liability. It was claimed that the car was defectively constructed in its coupling attachments, and whether it was or not was properly left to the jury. But the imperfections which were claimed to exist other than those just mentioned were not latent defects. The third special charge asked by appellants embraced several distinct propositions: First, that it was plaintiff’s duty to have acquainted himself with the general dp ties of the position. Second, that he assumed at his peril the dangers and risk naturally and usually incident to his employment, including the dangers and risk of such defects as were reasonably open to his ordinary inspection under the circumstances. Third, that if he knew that the drawhead was defective, or if the defects were open and visible, and failed to notify defendants of the danger of same, and without objection and protest continued in defendants’ service, he would be presumed to have assumed the .risk incident to the defects. The court in its general charge gave sufficiently the substance of the first two rules. The effect of the third could be inferred, perhaps, from the language used in the general charge, and in another special instruction given at request of appellant. But the rule there laid down is nowhere pointedly given to the jury. If it had been embodied in a separate request it would have been proper for the court to give it. But in asking special charges parties ought' not to so connect propositions contained in the general charge with others not given as to make it necessary for the court to unduly repeat the same instruction. • It can be easily perceived how such a practice would lead to serious irregularities, but if there were no other ground for reversal, we would not feel justified in holding this to be an error. The fourth charge .requested should have been given. It stated correctly the law, and the several"" propositions it contains were not given in the charge with such distinctness as to render it unnecessary. The fifth requested instruction, we have already seen, was improperly refused. Both propositions in it announced law directly applicable to the facts. The sixth and thirteenth special charges were both properly refused. The sixth was, that appellee in accepting emplo3rment assumed to understand the service, and to be competent to discharge the duty of brakeman, unless the evidence shows that in the contract of emphtyment defendant assumed to instruct him with reference to his duty and the dangers incident to the service. No question as to the duty of the master to instruct the servant as to his general"" duties was properly involved in the case. It was claimed, however, b3r appellee, that the car by which he was hurt was of an unusual make and caused extra danger to him in coupling it, and the duty of appellants to warn him of the danger to result from the use of such car was in question. Such an instruction as that requested might easity have been misapplied by the jury as controlling this issue. The thirteenth requested instruction was based upon a rule of appellants, as follows: “ Great care must be used in coupling and uncoupling cars. Do not go between cars unless they are moving at a slow and safe speed, nor attempt to make any coupling unless the drawbars and other coupling appliances are known to be in good order.” The special charge requested the court to charge the jury, that if plaintiff did not use great care in making the coupling, or went between the cars when the same were not going at a safe rate of speed, or attempted to make the coupling when the drawbars or other coupling appliances were not known by plaintiff to be in good order, plaintiff could not recover. The court had charged in effect that appellee was bound to know the rules of appellants, and that if his injury resulted from his failure in this respect he could not recover, and that his inability to read would not exempt him from this duty. There was evidence that appellee could not read well, and did not know of the rule in question. It was the duty of appellants to furnish cars with reasonably safe coupling appliances in good order, so far as the exercise of ordinary care would enable them to do so. Appellee had the right to assume that this duty had been discharged, and that the couplings of the car were in proper order, until he knew, or by the exercise of ordinary care ought to have known, the contrary. It ivas not his duty to examine or inspect the attachments of the car, but this duty the law devolved upon the master, so far as its performance was involved in the care required of him. The effect of the instruction requested, if not of the charge actually given, was to reverse the positions of the master and servant in this respect. Delivered November 17, 1892. It imposed upon the servant a duty not warranted by law. The first part of the rule contains cautions which it would doubtless be the duty of the servant to observe without a rule. But the latter portion, which requires the servant to know that the coupling appliances are in good order before going between the cars, should not be given as the law of the case. The sixteenth assignment' brings into question the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict. We can not say that there is not enough evidence in the case to sustain a verdict for appellee, though on several points it is quite debatable. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","S. W. Fordyce and A. H. Swanson, Receivers, v. Jeff D. Yarborough. No. 27. 1. Defective Charge. — A charge which in substance informs the jury that if defendants were guilty of negligence in allowing the coupling which caused the injur)' to become defective, and appellant was injured while coupling the car, without negligence on his own part, that he might recover, is defective for not adding the further fact essential to a recovery, that the injury must have resulted from the defective condition of the coupling-. 2. Extra Hazards — When a charge is given upon the subject of the liability of the master for negligent failure to inform the servant of the extra hazards arising from the use of a car of more than ordinarily dangerous construction. the jury must also be informed that the failure of the master to perform his duty in this respect must have proximately caused the injury; there is nothing in this case to warrant the court in assuming these facts to be established. 3. Latent Defects. — The master would not be liable for injury caused by latent defects in the car, unless by the exercise of proper care he ought or could have known of those defects: therefore, the following charge was erroneous: ■‘If the defect in the car was latent, and not known to the plaintiff, and could not be known by the exercise of ordinary care, then the duty was on the master to acquaint him with the defect, if any exists.” 4. Same. — There was testimony that, after the accident, the spring of the ■drawhead was found defective, and some of the castings about it were broken, and this was the only evidence tending to show latent defects. If these defects •existed at the time appellee was hurt, and appellants knew or with proper care ought to have known of them, then their duty was to repair them, and their failure to inform appellee of these defects would neither increase nor diminish their liability. 5. Special Charges Asked. — The third special charge asked by appellants embraced three distinct propositions, two of which had been sufficiently .given in the general charge. The third proposition was, “ That if the plaintiff knew that the drawhead was defective, or if the defects were open and visible, and he failed to notify defendants of the danger of the same, and without objection and protest continued in defendants’ service, he would be presumed to have assumed the risk incident to the defects.” If it had been embodied in a separate request, it would have been proper for the court to give it; but in asking charges parties ought not to so connect propositions contained in the general charge with others not given as to make it necessary for the court to unduly repeat the same instruction. 6. Charge Approved. — The fourth charge asked by appellants, as found in the statement of the case, was approved. 7. Master Instructing Servant. — No question as to the duty of the master to instruct the servant as to his general duties was properly involved in this •case, and an instruction was properly refused which charged that appellee, in accepting employment, assumed to understand the service, and to be competent to discharge the duty of brakeman, unless the evidence shows that in the contract of employment defendant assumed to instruct him with reference to his duty and the dangers incident to the service. 8. Rules of Company. — A rule of appellants provided: “ G-reat care must be used in coupling and uncoupling cars. Do not go between cars unless they are moving at slow and safe rate of speed, nor attempt to make any coupling unless the drawbars and other coupling appliances are known to he in good order.” This charge was asked: “ If plaintiff did not use great care in making the coupling, or went between the cars when the same were not going at a safe rate of speed, or attempted to make the coupling when the drawbars or other coupling appliances were not known to plaintiff to he in good order, he can not recover.” The charge was properly refused. The duty of the appellants being to furnish cars with reasonably safe coupling appliances, in good order, appellee had the right to assume that this duty had been performed until he knew, or ought to have known, the contrary. It was not his duty to examine or inspect the attachments of the car, but the master’s, so far as its performance was involved in the care required of him. The latter part of the charge, which requires the servant to know that the coupling appliances are in good order before going between the cars, was not the law of the case. Appeal from Smith. Tried below before Hon. Felix J. McCord. The plaintiff was a brakeman, and was injured while making a coupling-between the engine (which was backing at the rate of from two to four-miles per hour) and a box car, which was standing on a side track. The drawhead of the car gave way and went back under the car, and the plaintiff was caught between the car and the rear end of the tender of the engine, and injured. The car was differently constructed from the-cars generally in use. The railway company had other cars like the one by which the plaintiff was injured, but plaintiff had handled only this, one. The evidence is voluminous, but enough has been stated and will be found in the opinion of the court to elucidate the opinion. The fourth charge asked by the defendants is as follows: “ You are charged that neither individuals nor corporations are bound as employers to insure the absolute safety of the machinery or mechanical appliances which they provide for the use of their employes; nor are they bound to employ the best and the newest of these appliances for the purpose of securing the safety of those who are thus employed. They are only bound to use reasonable care and prudence for the safety of those in their service, by providing them with machinery reasonably safe for the use of the latter; and where an employer fails in this duty of precaution and care, he is responsible for any injury which may happen by-reason of defects in machinery which were or ought to have been known to him, and were unknown to the servant. But if the servant knew of the defect in the machinery, or the defects were obvious and open to observation, in which case he would be presumed to know them, and yet remained in the service and continued to use the machinery without giving any notice thereof to the master, he would be deemed to have assumed the risks of all danger reasonably to be apprehended to such use, and is entitled to no recover}'. And if the servant may have been wanting in such reasonable care and prudence as would have apprehended the happening of the accident, he is guilty of contributory negligence, and the master is thereby absolved from responsibility for the injury, although it was occasioned by the defect of the machinery through the negligence of the master.” Finlay, Marsh & Butler, for appellants. 1. The fact that the master furnishes to the servant defective machinery, or appliances differently constructed and more hazardous than those in customary use, of which the servant is ignorant, and that the servant while using such machinery or apparatus, using proper care, is injured, is not per se sufficient to render the master liable to the servant for injuries so received by him, but the master can only be chargeable when the defects in the machinery are the proximate cause of the injuries. Railway v. McAtee, 61 Texas, 695; Cool, on Torts, 68; 2 Thomps. on Trials, sec. 1676. 2. Although machinery furnished b)1- the master to the servant may be of peculiar and unusual construction, with which the servant is unacquainted, and in the use of which he is injured, still the master would not be guilty of negligence in failing to notify the servant of such construction, unless he knew or ought to have known that the danger to the servant in the use of said machinery was thereby increased and rendered more hazardous. Railway v. McCarthy, 64 Texas, 632; Wood Mast, and Serv., secs. 344, 345; Pierce on Rys., 370; Cool, on Torts, 556. 3. Where the master knows, or in the exercise of ordinary care ought to know, of any latent defects in machinery, it is his duty to warn the servant of them; but in no case can the master be held chargeable for an injury resulting to his servant from latent defects in the machinery, unless negligence or fault can be imputed to him. Railway v. Bell, 75 Texas, 50; Railway v. Lyde, 57 Texas, 507; Railway v. Oram, 49 Texas, 341; Railway v. McAtee, 61 Texas, 695; Railway Acc.

The servant assumes all risk of latent defects in machinery and appliances unknown to the master, unless the master was negligent in not discovering the same, and the question whether or not a defect was discoverable is for the jury. Railway v. Crenshaw, 71 Texas, 340; Railway v. Silliphant, 70 Texas, 623; 14 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 844; Wood Mast. and Serv., sec. 345; Ballou v. Railway, 54 Wis., 157; Steffen v.

St., 343; Bunnell v. Railway, 29 Minn., 305; Leahy v. Railway, 65 Cal., 150. 5. A servant who remains in the service, knowing of a defect in machinery used by him without giving notice thereof, assumes the risk of injury therefrom, and he will be presumed to know of defects which are obvious and open to inspection. Rogers v. Street Railway, 76 Texas, 502; Railway v. Bradford, 66 Texas, 732; Railway v. Lempe, 59 Texas, 19; Railway v. McDade, 135 U. S., 570; 14 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 845, 846, and authorities cited in notes. 6. The master does not warrant the safety of his machinery, nor is he bound to employ as to his servant the latest and most approved machinery, but only such as is suitable; and if the servant knows or ought to know of the defective condition of the machinery, and continues to expose himself to danger from it, even in the necessary execution of his duties, he assumes the risk, and can not charge the master with damages resulting to him from such exposure. Railway v. Doyle, 49 Texas, 190; 14 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 892; Railway Accident Law, 301, 302; Railway v. Smithson, 45 Mich, 212; Whitman v. Railway, 58 Wis., 408; 21 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, 633; Railway v. Flanigan, 77 Ill., 365. 7. Though the master negligently furnish to his servant defective machinery, in the use of which the servant is injured, still the master is not liable for damages to the servant where the proximate cause of the injuries was the negligence of the servant in the use of the machinery. Murray v. Railway, 73 Texas, 2; 13 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 861; 2 Thomp. on Neg., 1104 (notes), 1146; Cool. on Torts, 563; Buzzell v. Mfg. Co., 77 Am. Dec., 212 (note), 218. 8. The master has the right, and it is his duty, to adopt reasonable rules and regulations for the management of his business and the safety of his servants, and where the servant is injured by reason of his performing the duties assigned him in violation of such rules and regulations, the master is not liable to respond to him in damages.

Cases, 307. 2. Appellee was injured by a defective car which was faulty in its original construction. Appellee had never seen the car before and did not know of the defect, and it was not easily perceived without examination or inspection for that purpose, but was generally known to be dangerous by the employes, and could with reasonable diligence have been known to the defendants, and defendants were therefore liable. Railway v. Fredericks, 71 Ill., 294; Gibson v. Railway, 46 Mo., 163. 3. It was not the duty of appellee as a brakeman to inspect the car, but this duty devolved upon the defendants, and the defect being such as must have been seen from an inspection of the car, and which defendants must have known, they were liable. Railway v. O’Fiel, 78 Texas, 486. 4. In coupling the car appellee had a right to assume that the car was in good condition, and he was not bound to stop and look to see whether or not the drawliead and coupling apparatus were safe.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. In September, 1883, appellee was in the-employ of appellant as brakeman, and on the 25th of said month voluntarily quit said employment. In December following, appellant, for its-own use, printed a pamphlet entitled, “ Missouri Pacific Railway Company, leased and operated lines. List of employes discharged for cause during the months of April, May, June, July, August, September, and-October, 1883.” In said pamphlet appeared a large- number of names, among which was that of appellee, and opposite his name, and in the-column which gave the cause for which employes named in said list were-discharged, was inserted the word “incompetent.” This list was distributed by appellant to its agents who had charge of the employing and discharging of its employes. Appellant at this time was operating something near 6000 miles of railroad, and had in its employ something over 20,000 employes, and this list was issued to prevent men who were found to be unsuitable from being re-employed on other parts, of its road. After ■ appellee learned that his name was in this list he called on T. J. Ray, appellant's train master at Fort Worth, who had previously employed him, and called his attention to the injustice done him by this publication, and Ray, after investigating the matter, gave him a written statement that he had not been discharged on account of “ incomptency,” but had left the service of his own volition. After this, however, in March, 1884, appellant reissued this pamphlet, bringing it down to said month, and in ■ said list appellee’s name appeared as before. On account of the publication of his name as aforesaid appellee was several times discharged upon the different lines of railway operated by appellant, and for the damage caused him by this publication he instituted this suit, and recovered judgment for $2000, from which this appeal is prosecuted. Under previous decisions of our Supreme Court, it is quite plain that this publication, made under the circumstances and for the purposes set forth in the conclusions of fact, must be regarded as privileged, and although false, damages can not be recovered therefor against appellant unless express malice be shown. Behee v. Railway, 71 Texas, 424; Railway v. Richmond, 73 Texas, 568; Bradstreet Co. v. Grill, 72 Texas, 121. That corporations can be made liable in damages for the publication of a libel is now well settled (see authorities cited above; also Railway v. Quigley, 21 Howard, 202; Fogg v. Railway, 148 Massachusetts, 513; Townshend on Slander and Libel, 470-475); and that they can also entertain the express malice necessary to render them liable for such publication seems also to be settled. Townshend, 475, cited above, with authorities referred to in note, some of which are not accessible to us. As to what is meant by the express malice necessary to render the publisher of a privileged communication liable therefor, has been the subject of much controversy. Mr. Townshend, on page 68 of his work, in defining the terms express and implied malice, says; “ Probably the phrase ‘ implied malice’ is identical with the phrase 6 malice in law,’ and the phrase 1 express malice ’ with the phrase 6 malice in fact.’ ” And again, on page 300, the same author says; “ Few rules of law are of greater practical importance than that which requires proof of express malice where the words were spoken under circumstances which make the communication privileged. The malice required to deprive communications of this sort of protection arising out of the making of the publication must be such as to induce the court, or any reasonable person, to draw the inference that the occasion has been taken advantage of to give currency to an unfounded charge.” It is well settled that this express malice, or malice in fact, can be proven by circumstances, and one of the most frequent methods of proving it is to show the falsity of the publication and a repetition thereof after notice. Behee v. Railway, 71 Texas, 424; Hays v. Railway, 46 Texas, 272; 1 Whart. on Law of Ev., 31. In this case it is made to appear that the lists in question were published by order of A. A: Talmage, the general manager of appellant, and it is quite plain that Talmage personally entertained no ill will toward appellee, he not being acquainted with him or knowing that his name was in the book. Talmage, however, only had the publication made; and it is not made to appear to whom the duty of ascertaining the information in reference to these employes was entrusted, nor how the appellee’s name came to be inserted in these lists. This information must have been accessible to appellant. It must have known which one of its employes furnished this information. In addition to the total lack of foundation for the charge against appellee, the publication was reissued after appellant’strain master had full notice thereof. This may have been done through mistake, but if so it would seem that appellant could have shown this more satisfactorily than is disclosed by this record. As stated above, this is one of the methods of proving malice in fact, and in the absence of a clearer showing on the part of appellant, we are not prepared to say that the verdict of the jury finding that such malice should be imputed to it should be disturbed. We realize how important some such system as this must be for the protection of persons or corporations employing large numbers of men, as well as to the public. At the same time, where an unfounded publication has been repeated, under the circumstances detailed above, we can not say that the verdict of the jury finding malice in fact is not sustained by the evidence. It seems that after appellee gave the notice to Ray, and received from him the statement referred to above, he several times sought employment on the different lines of appellant’s railway, and after being engaged in good positions was discharged on account of his name appearing in the lists aforesaid, by reason of which he lost much time and was caused mental suffering and annoyance; and under the circumstances we do not regard a verdict of 82000 as excessive.

"KEY, Associate Justice. Appellee Campbell brought this suit against appellant, the railway company, for damages. The foundation for the action, as charged in appellee’s petition, consisted in an unlawful and wrongful ejection of appellee from a train of cars while he was traveling as a passenger from St. Louis, Missouri, to San Antonio, Texas. He pleaded a written contract, purporting on its face to be a contract between him and the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company for the shipment of two carloads of live stock from Brackenridge, Texas, to St. Louis, Missouri. The petition alleges that the agent of the last named company, who executed and delivered the contract referred to, was also appellant’s agent, and, in effect, charges that the contract was executed for appellant. These allegations were not denied under oath, and for this reason the District Court, following Railway v. Tisdale, 74 Texas, 8, held that this contract was binding on appellant. The contract stipulated, among other things, ""that in consideration of appellee paying $163.20 for the transportation of the two cars of cattle, he was to have free transportation to and from St. Louis for himself. To secure this return transportation free, he was required to present his contract at the office of the connecting railroad at St. Louis within twenty days from its date, and there receive a drover’s pass, which he did. The contract in question also contained the following stipulation: “And it is further stipulated, agreed, and fully understood by the parties hereto, that in case the live stock mentioned herein is to be transported over the road or roads of any other railroad company, the said party of the first part shall be released from liability of every kind after said live stock shall have left its road, as the party of the first part is only bound for the transportion of said stock to San Antonio station, the end of its line on the route over which said stock is to be shipped; and the party of the second part hereby so expressly stipulates and agrees; the understanding of both parties hereto being that the party of the first part shall not be held or deemed liable for anything beyond the line of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway, excepting to protect the through rate of freight named herein.” On the back of the contract was the following: “ We, the undersigned owners, or in charge of the live stock mentioned in the within contract, in consideration of the free pass granted us by the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, hereby agree that the said San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company shall not be liable to us for any injury or damages of any kind suffered by us while in charge of said stock or on our return passage. “ Jotjrd Campbell. “ No cars inside. Pass J. Campbell from Brackenridge to Nat. Stock Yards; parties in charge accompanying stock. “L. D. Hopkins, Station Master.” The return pass was issued by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, but the petition alleged that the agent who issued it was also acting foi appellant. Upon this pass and the contract referred to, appellee was allowed to travel free of charge from St. Louis to Texarkana. He was on the Texas & Pacific Railway when he reached the latter place, and the conductor told him that his pass was not good for 90 miles of the road to be traveled immediately after passing Texarkana, and that he would have to pay fare for this 90 miles. This appellee refused to do, and the conductor called in a policeman and compelled him to get off the train at Texarkana after midnight, in the rain, etc. This all occurred on the Texas & Pacific Railway, and not on the International & Great Northern Railroad, which, it was shown, terminated at Longview, a considerable distance from Texarkana. The trial court instructed the jury, that if they found for the plaintiff, to allow him such actual damages as he was shown by the testimony to have sustained by his unlawful ejection from the train; that this would include such sums of money as he was necessarily compelled to expend in completing his journey to San Antonio, necessary hotel bills, and compensation for loss of time; and that if they found that appellee’s expulsion from the train was not only wrongful, but was accomplished in a rude or insulting manner and under circumstances calculated to mortify and humiliate him, and if in fact he was thereby humiliated and mortified, then the jury might allow him fair and reasonable compensation for the injury done him by reason of the outrage and indignity so inflicted upon him. The charge, however, clearly limited the right of recovery to actual damages. The jury returned a verdict for appellee for $750. It is contended by appellant that the doctrine announced in Harris v. Howe, Receiver, etc., 74 Texas, 534, and Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. Baird, 75 Texas, 256, and since adhered to by repeated decisions of our Supreme Court, to the effect that a common carrier may limit its liability to such losses and injuries as occur on its own line, applies to this case; and that, as the injury was occasioned upon another railroad than appellant’s, by the terms of the contract it is not liable. The allegation in appellee’s petition that the contract attached to and made part thereof was executed by or in behalf of appellant, not being denied under oath, renders it, in law, its contract. It is, therefore, to be construed as if the name International & Great-Northern Railway Company was substituted for the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Bail way Company wherever the latter appears in the contract; but those provisions thereof which enure to appellant’s benefit, and which could lawfully be made, are to be enforced, as well as those that are benficial to appellee. Appellant could not lawfully contract for immunity from loss of or injury to the property shipped, or injury to appellee, occasioned by the wrongful act or omission of appellant or its servants while on the line of its railroad; but it could, and if a party to the contract, it did, stipulate for its nonliability for any such wrongful act or omission of any other common carrier, except that it agreed to protect the through rate of freight, and to furnish appellee free transportation to and from St. Louis; and this it was bound to do for the entire distance. Under the facts disclosed by the record (there being no verified plea denying averments of agency in appellee’s petition), we think he was a passenger on the Texas Pacific Bail way on the occasion in question; that because of the refusal of the conductor to allow him to remain on the train at Texarkana without paying fare, there was a breach of appellant’s contract to furnish him free transportation to and from St. Louis; and that as a result of this breach of contract he.is entitled to recover such sum of money, and no more, as will compensate him for money necessarily paid out for railroad fare and hotel bills, and for loss of time, which money would not have been paid out, and time lost, but for the breach of the contract. The claim for damages as compensation for mental suffering (mortification and humiliation of mind), caused by the rude or insulting manner of the conductor who put appellee off the train, can not be maintained as against appellant. This injury does not flow from a mere breach of the contract, but arises out of and rests upon the rude and wanton manner in which the contract was broken. The mere failure to comply with the agreement was not a tort, but the wanton and insulting conduct of the conductor at the time was; and it was upon this tort that appellee based and maintained, in the court below, his demand for compensation for wounded feelings. Railway v. Roemer, ante, 191. Against this latter claim, appellant is protected by the terms of the contract invoked and relied upon by appellee. Giving to this contract the most favorable construction it can be susceptible of in behalf of appellee, it must be held to exempt appellant from liability for injury to either his person or feelings, when such injury did not occur upon either its own road or the San Antonio & Aransas Pass road. Delivered November 30, 1892. It is proper to say that this case was tried in the court below before the decision in Harris v. Howe, supra, was rendered; and the record indicates that the defense urged in this court, under the principle enunciated in that case, was not relied on as strenuously as it is here. The judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","The International & Great Northern Railway Company v. Jourd Campbell. No. 49. 1.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. We adopt the findings of fact filed by the court below, except from finding 20 strike out the words, “ were not responsible parties,” and add to finding 23 the following: “ By the word ‘ protest,’ as used in this finding, is meant that the Treasurer of the State-had several times refused to accept this money, and at the time he received it in January, 1891, the parties paying fully understood that the State would contest their claim to this land, and the Treasurer did not-receive the money as a legal payment therefor.” The subject matter of this controversy is 466 sections, or 298,240 acres-of land, situated in Scurry, Borden, and adjoining counties. In 1873 the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company, for the purpose of locating its land certificates thereon, had a large amount of surveying done in Scurry, Borden, Howard, Kent, and Fisher Counties. This surveying was done by dividing large blocks of land into sections containing 640 acres each, as will be seen by reference to our conclusions of fact, and was done upon the ground in such way as might be regarded as work in the field. The surveying so done by said railway company embraced all of the land in controversy in this suit, but its right thereto-failed by reason of the land at that time being within what is known as the Texas & Pacific Railway Reservation. On December 1,1882, E. M. Bacon and E. G. Graves made application-to the proper surveyor to survey for them a large part of this Houston & Texas Central Railway Company land, embracing that in controversy in this suit, which they desired to purchase under the Act of July 14, 1879,. amended March 11', 1881, which was generally known as the fifty-cent act. The surveyor, instead of doing this work upon the ground, simply adopted the work which had previously been done by the railway company, and copied their field notes from the records in his office, and the field notes so obtained were returned by Bacon and Graves, as to the land in controversy, to the General Land Office within the time required by the law above cited. Bacon and Graves, at the time they returned the field notes, knew how the surveyor had obtained them, and that none of the work had been done in the field. The deputies of the surveyor, however, who appeared from the certificates to the field notes to have done this work, had previously been upon the ground in making other surveys, and had seen enough of the railway work to satisfy them of its correctness. The act under which Bacon and Graves were attempting to acquire this land provides, that “Any person, firm, or corporation desiring to purchase any of the unappropriated lands herein set apart and reserved for sale, may do so by causing the tract or tracts which said person, firm, or corporation desire to purchase to be surveyed by the authorized public surveyor of the county or district in which said land is situated;” •and the question as to whether or not the obtaining of the field notes in the manner above set forth should be considered as their having had the land surveyed within the meaning of this act, constitutes the most important question for our decision in this case. Prior to the adoption of our Revised Statutes, in prescribing the manner in which surveys were to be made, our law provided, that “The courses of the lines shall be determined by the magnetic needle, and care shall be taken to determine 'its variation from the pole in the district where the surveys are made. The surveys shall be made with great caution, with metallic chains made for the purpose, and care shall be taken that the place of beginning the survey of each parcel of land be established with certainty, taking the bearings and distances of two permanent objects at least.” Under this law, at an early day, the practice became so common among surveyors to disregard its provisions, by making out field notes in their offices from data obtained otherwise than by work done upon the ground, that the courts in a great number of cases have felt constrained to hold that where the question was raised by subsequent locators, dr third parties adversely interested, such acts on the part of the surveyor would ■constitute a valid appropriation of the land as against such claims. Horton v. Pace, 9 Texas, 84; Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Texas, 231; Jones v. Burgett, 46 Texas, 293; Styles v. Gray, 10 Texas, 506; and in Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 392, strong language is used recognizing the adoption of field notes previously surveyed as being a legal survey within the spirit of our law as it stood previous to the adoption of our Revised Statutes. At the same time, it is not to be denied that to constitute a survey strictly within the terms of our law as it has always been, it would be necessary for the work to be done upon the ground in the manner prescribed by the statute. In Stafford v. King, 30 Texas, 269, it is said: “It is the duty of the surveyor to run round the land located and intended to be embraced by the survey and patent, to see that such objects are designated on it as will clearly point out and identify the locality and boundaries of the tract, and to ""extend a correct description of these objects, natural and artificial, with courses and distances, into the field notes of the survey, in order that they may be inserted in the patent, which will afford the owner, as well as other persons, the means of identifying the land that was in fact located and surveyed for the owner.” In Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284, it is said: “Actual surveys by which lands granted by the State shall be specifically described and distinguished have always been contemplated and prescribed by our laws. It is true, that under the laws in force when the surveys in controversy were made for the railway company, it was not always regarded as indispensable, however desirable, that the lines of the survey should be actually run and measured on the ground.” Recognizing the great inaccuracies that had frequently resulted from the practices of the different surveyors in attempting to make out field notes in their offices without surveying the land upon the ground, our Legislature, in adopting the Revised Statutes, inserted this provision, (article 3908): “The field notes of each survey shall state: (1) The county or district in which the land is situated. (2) The certificate or other authority under or by virtue of which it is made, giving a true description of same by numbers, date, when and where issued, name of original grantee, and quantity. (3) The land by proper field notes with the necessary calls and connections for identification (observing the Spanish measurement by varas). (4) A diagram of the survey. (5) The variation at which the running was made. (6) It shall show the names of the chain carriers. (7) It shall be dated and signed by the surveyor. (8) The correctness of the survey, and that it was made according to law, shall be certified to officially by the survey or whomade the same; and also, that such survey was actually made in the field, and that the field notes have been duly recorded, giving book and page. (9) When the survey has been made by a deputy, the county or district surveyor shall certify officially that he has examined the field notes, has found them correct, and that they are duly recorded, giving book and page of record.” We think the principal object of the Legislature in requiring such strictness in the certificate to be made by the surveyor was to correct the abuse to which the previous law had been subjected as above indicated; and we think it must be conceded, that if the Legislature has the power to condemn what is commonly known as an office survey or office work, and to require its officers, before parting with the public land of the State, to have the surveying actually done in the field, it has done so by the passage of this statute. We know of no case in which the question has been raised as to the validity of an office survey, or the adoption of previous field notes for a survey which should have been made in the field, since the adoption of our Revised Statutes: but our Supreme Court, in several cases, has given strong intimations that its rulings under previous laws would not apply to such surveys. In Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, cited above, in which the very strongest language is used in upholding such surveys under previous laws, it is said: “ The manner of making surveys was not so specifically prescribed, nor the requirements so exacting, in the year 1874 as are they by the law now in force,” etc. Also, Chief Justice Stay ton, in a dissenting opinion delivered by him in Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 290, uses this language: “I do not understand the holding to be that the field notes returned into the General Land Office were void because not based -on the actual survey of each of the four lines of every section embraced in the block. If such were the holding, it would be useless to refer to -decisions made under the laws in force prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes for the purpose of showing that the rulings of this court have in all preceding cases been to the contrary.” Also, see the opinion of the majority of the court in Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284, quoted above. In Jumbo Cattle Company v. Bacon and Graves, 79 Texas, 12, in speaking of what would constitute a survey of this land under the Acts of 1879 and 1881, it is said: “ We think, too, that the agreed statement shows that they have taken all the steps required of them to perfect their right to the land had these acts remained in force. However improbable it may be that this vast quantity of land could have been surveyed into sections of 640 acres each within two days, we feel bound to follow the explicit agreement, that on January 19 and 20, 1883, the said surveyor of Palo Pinto Land District surveyed the lands in controversy into tracts of .640 acres each.” It will be borne in mind that the question presented for decision in this case is not whether the field notes, made out as indicated in the first part of this opinion, constitute such a survey as the officers of the State could adopt, should they see proper to do so, nor whether it is such an absolute nullity as could be taken advantage by a third party; but the question is, does it constitute such a survey within the meaning of the law as the State can be compelled to accept in opposition to its wishes ? The appellants are seeking to enforce against the State an executory con-tract, and base their right to do this upon the ground that they have complied with their part of such contract. In such case, we think they should show that they have obtained the field notes in the manner the State said they should be obtained in its prqposition, and not that they have got as good field notes in some other way as would have been obtained had they complied with the State’s offer. Had an individual owned this large body of land, and had published and offered to sell to any person 640 acres, who would have it surveyed by the authorized public surveyor of the county in which the land was situated, arid that such surveyor must certify that the work was actually done in the field, we think it would hardly be contended that the proposed purchaser could file his petition against the owner, setting up that the surveyor had copied some field notes for him from the work which had been done by some other surveyor years before, and that by reason of the field notes thus obtained he had a right to compel the owner to accept such field notes as a compliance with his offer, and to execute a deed for the land embraced therein; and we see no reason why a different rule should be applied to the State than that applied to an individual under similar circumstances. We know of no case in which the State, as a compliance with an executory contract, was held bound against its wish to accept one of these office surveys, even under the old law; and still less do we believe that it could be compelled to accept such field notes under the law as it was at the time these surveys purport to have been made. We think the court did not err in overruling appellants’ special exceptions to the petition of the State. Appellants had filed an application to purchase land under the Act of 1879, giving the description of their desired purchase substantially as set forth in the petition in this case, thereby showing that they assert claim to that part of the State’s land, and we think they can not be heard to say that such description was not sufficient in a petition brought to cancel their claim; besides, the answer filed by appellants contained a sufficient description of that part of the land embraced in the State’s petition which they claimed, and we see no reason why such description would not serve as a basis for the judgment rendered. We also see no objection to the form of the State’s petition. State v. Delesdenier, 7 Texas, 76; The State v. Kroner, 2 Texas, 492; Day Land and Cattle Co. v. The State, 68 Texas, 535. We do not now consider it ah open question in this State, that the State, in a suit of this kind, is not required to make a tender of the money received by it. The State v. Snyder, 66 Texas, 687; The State v. Thompson, 64 Texas, 690; The State v. Rhomberg, 69 Texas, 220; Randolph v. The State, 73 Texas, 485. It will be seen from the conclusions of fact adopted by us, that we are of opinion that the finding of the court below, that Graves was an employe in the Land Office at the time he entered into the contract with Bacon to acquire this land, is supported by the evidence. We think the circumstances disclosed by the record lead to this conclusion, and would have justified a finding that, before he tendered his resignation, Graves and Bacon had come to an understanding as to the terms of their contract, and that Graves’ resignation was tendered in pursuance of this understanding, to enable him successfully to carry out the arrangement that had previously been understood would be made when it might be legally done; but as what we have said disposes of all the land in controversy, and as we have not fully decided as to the effect the agreement above indicated would have in a case where all steps prescribed by the law in the acquisition of the land from the State were taken, after the resignation had become complete, we have thought it best to express no opinion, thereon. We are of opinion that the first conclusion of law by the court below, that Bacon and Graves were not responsible parties at the time they applied to purchase this land, and could not purchase under the law, can not be sustained. We incline to the opinion that the question of responsibility, within the meaning of the Act of 1879, was for the surveyor to decide; and if he held them responsible parties and made the survey, this, would be sufficient to hold the land until the expiration of the time allowed the purchaser in which to make payment. We do not believe it was the policy of the law to restrict such sales to persons who, upon investigation of their financial condition, would be found able to pay for the land proposed to be purchased out of their own means, and thereby preclude those equally worthy, who, while not actually owning sufficient property of their own to make the payment, might yet be able, in the time-allowed, to make the necessary financial arrangements. White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 340. If the court, in its third conclusion of law,' intended to hold that because some of the surveys had a greater frontage of permanent water than is permitted under law, this would invalidate all of the surveys, we do not think the conclusion correct. It will be noted, that under this law the land was only to be sold in tracts of 640 acres, and we think that, under these provisions each tract must be treated as a separate purchase; and while the sections having such excessive water frontage might be held invalid, in so far as it would enable the proposed purchaser to demand title from the State as to them, yet these invalid sections could still be used as a basis to locate and identify the other surveys in the block. We are also of the opinion, that the fourth conclusion of law by the court below, to the effect that Bacon and Graves did not make a sufficient tender, can not be sustained as to all of the land. As.stated above, we think each section must be taken as a separate purchase, and the tender made by them sufficiently identified all sections upon which they proposed to pay; and the fact that they did not make tender upon all of the sections embraced in the field notes returned by them would only have the effect to invalidate such part of the proposed purchase as was not. designated in their offer to pay. By the decision in Jumbo Cattle Company v. Bacon and Graves, 79 Texas, we understand it to be settled that the tender was in time, and that the Treasurer could not defeat their right to purchase by refusing to receive the money . We are of opinion, that the court below erred in admitting the certificate of the Commissioner of the General Land Office to prove that surveys 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 of block M were never returned to the General Land Office (Buford v. Bostick, 58 Texas, 67); but we are not prepared to say that the evidence outside of this certificate was not sufficient to sustain the finding of the court below that these surveys were never in fact so returned. There was no objection to the certificate of the Commissioner to prove that he had made search for the field notes of these surveys, and had been unable to find them in the General Land Office, and that they were not at the time of making said certificate in their proper places; and we think it quite as probable that these field notes-had been lost or mislaid before they reached the Land Office as after, and for this reason the judgment of the court below as to these surveys could be sustained without reference to the objectionable part of this certificate; but as the bill of exceptions shows that the court below must have considered this part of the certificate of the Commissioner as important evidence to sustain its finding upon this point, we are of opinion, that were, it material in the disposition of the case, it would necessitate a reversal as to these surveys. We think what we have said sufficiently disposes of the other- assignments of error made by appellants; and as we find no error in the judgment rendered by the court below, we are of opinion that it should in all things be affirmed.'

Survey of Public Land—Office Survey Invalid, When.—Article 3908 of the Revised Statutes requires a survey of public land to be actually made on the ground, and the State can not, in opposition to its wishes, be compelled to accept an office survey constructed by merely copying and adopting the field notes of a previous survey made on the ground for other parties by other surveyors. 2. Same — Survey Under Fifty-Gent Act.—Such office survey, made by adopting prior field notes, is not sufficient to enable a purchaser to enforce against the State an executory contract for the sale of public lands under the “ fifty-cent"" Act of July 14,1879, as amended March 11,1881, even though it might constitute a valid survey should the officers of the State see proper to so recognize it, or might not be such a nullity as could be taken advantage of by third persons. 3. Trespass to Try Title—Scope of Action.—The State may properly bring suit in the form of an action of trespass to try title to cancel, on the ground of illegality and fraud, a contract for the sale of its public lands, although patents have not been issued to the purchaser for the lands. 4. Same—Description of Lands Sued for.—In such an action it is sufficient. if the petition gives substantially the same description of the lands as contained in the defendant’s application to purchase them, especially where the defendant’s answer contains such a description of them as will serve as a basis for the judgment rendered. 5. Cancelling Sale — Tendering Back Purchase Money. —It is not now an open question, that in an action brought to cancel an illegal sale of the public lands the State is not required to tender back the purchase money it may have received. 6. Purchase of Public Land by Employe of State.—See the opinion for evidence held sufficient to sustain a finding that G. was an employe of the General Land Office at the time he entered into a contract with B. for the joint purchase by them of public lands, and that his resignation as such employe was in pursuance of such contract and understanding. 7. Purchase Under Pifty-Cent Act—Responsibility of Purchaser. Under the “ fifty-cent” Act of July 14,1879, providing that public lands might be purchased “ by any responsible person,” the question of such responsibility was for the surveyor to decide; and if he held the party to be responsible, and made the survey for him. this would be sufficient to hold the land until the expiration of the time allowed by law for paying the purchase money to the State.- 8. Same—Invalidity of Part of the Surveys.—Where a party applied under the ""fifty-cent""’ act to purchase a number of surveys, the fact that some of them were illegally made, because having too great a frontage on permanent water, would not invalidate the others, since each survey of 040 acres must, under the terms of that act, be treated as a separate purchase. 9. Same—Tender on only Part of the Surveys.—For the same reason, it must be held that the failure of the purchaser to tender payment on all the surveys made under his application would only have the effect to invalidate such part of the proposed purchase as was not covered by the tender. 10. Same—Tender Made in Time.—Where the application to purchase under the “fifty-cent""’ act was made December 1,1882, and the lands were surveyed January 17 to January 22,1883, and the field notes were filed in the General Land Office in March, 1883, a tender on May 19, 1883, of the purchase money due thereon to the State was made in time, although the act was repealed January 22, 1883; and the State Treasurer could not defeat the applicants’ right of purchase by refusing to receive the money. Following Cattle Company v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 5. 11. Evidence — Certificate of Commissioner of General Land Office.—While it was error to admit in evidence a certificate of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, stating that he had made search in the General Land Office for the field notes of certain surveys, and had been unable to find them, and that they were not in the files of said office, “and were never filed in the Land Office at Austin,” yet such error was not material in this instance, since all of such field notes being illegal, their filing, if made, could have conferred no rights, and the entire case is disposed of on other issues. Appeal from Mitchell. Tried below before Hon. Wm. Kennedy. The trial court’s findings of fact, adopted in the opinion, and also its conclusions of law, several of which are referred to therein, are as follows: “ 1. On December 1, 1882, E. M. Bacon and E. G. Graves made application to Joel McKee, who was then the surveyor of the Palo Pinto Land District, as such surveyor, to purchase the land in controversy, under what is known as the fifty-cent act, approved July 14, 1879, and amended March 11, 1881, which said application was received and recorded by said surveyor on said day. “ 2. The land so applied for was situated at the time of application in the Palo Pinto Land District, and the said surveyor was the proper officer to whom application for the purchase of the same should have been made. “ 3. Bacon and Graves paid the fees for filing the field notes in the General Land Office entirely within the time required by law. “4. By the records of the Land Office, the 117 sections of land of block B of the alleged Bacon and Graves survey purport to have been surveyed by H. M. Berry, deputy surveyor, on January 17, 18, and 19, 1883; that the field notes of said sections were recorded in the surveyor’s office on the 14tli and 18th days of March, 1883; that said field notes were returned to the General Land Office March 17, 1883; and the chain carriers who purport to have assisted said Berry in making said survey are J. H. Miller, J. B. Pierce, Andy Burns, Ed. Wagner, and H. C. Reed. “ 5. By the records of the Land Office, 91 sections of land of block G of the alleged Bacon and Graves survey purport to have been surveyed by H. M. Berry, deputy surveyor, on the 18th, 19th, 20tli, and 22d days of January, 1883. The field notes thereof were recorded in the survey- or’s office on March 14 and 15, 1883, and were returned to the General Land Office on March 17 and 20, 1883. “6. By the records of the Land Office, the remaining 200 sections of block G of said survey purport to have been surveyed by E. A. Williams, ■deputy surveyor, on January 17, 18, 19, and 20, 1883. The field notes thereof were recorded in the surveyor’s office on March 14 and 15, 1883, and were returned to the General Land Office March 17 and 20, 1883. “ 7. By the records of the Land Office, 25 sections of block M of .said survey purport to have been surveyed by H. M. Berry, deputy surveyor, on January 22, 1883. Field notes duly recorded in surveyor’s office March 14 and 15, 1883, and returned to the General Land Office March 20, 1883—except the field notes of sections 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 of said block M, which were never returned to the Land Office. 8. By the records of the Land Office, the remaining 94 sections of .said block M purport to have been surveyed on January 20, 21, 22, and 23, 1883. The field notes thereof were recorded in the surveyor’s office on March 14, 16, and 17,1883, and returned to the General Land Office March 20, 1883. “ 9. That by the records of the Land Office, sections 33 to 68, inclusive, of block M, purport to have been surveyed by E. A. Williams on January 21, 1883. January 21, 1883, was on Sunday. “ 10. By the records of the Land Office, sections 251 to 291, inclusive, of block G, and sections 1 to 25, inclusive, of block M, and section 115 of block M, purport to have been surveyed on January 22, 1883. And by the records of said office, sections 99 to 114, inclusive, and sections 116 to 126, inclusive, of block M, and sections 1 to 12, inclusive, of block N, which latter are in block 27, Houston & Texas Central Railway survey, purport to have been surveyed January 23, 1883. “ 11. By the records of the Land Office, sections 1 to 12, inclusive, of block N, purport to have been surveyed by H. M. Berry, on January 23, 1883. The field notes were recorded in the surveyor’s office March 14 and 16, 1883, and were returned to the General Land Office March 20, 1883. That sections 13 to 27, inclusive, of said block N, also sections 41, 42, and 47, purport to have been surveyed by Benjamin Boyds ton on January 20, 1883, and field notes returned to the Land Office March 20, 1883. “ 12. By the records of the Land Office, sections 28 to 40, inclusive, sections 43 to 46, inclusive, and sections 48 to 52, inclusive, of block N, purport to have been surveyed by Benjamin Boydston on January 21, 1883, and field notes returned to the Land Office March 20, 1883. “ 13. The surveyor of Palo Pinto Land District certified to the respec-' tive surveys herein before mentioned on the days said surveys purport to have been made. “ 14. None of the land included in this suit has ever been patented by the State under the Bacon and Graves purchase; and on the 26th day of May, 1890, Bacon and Graves transferred by deed of special warranty 579 sections of land to C. C. Gibbs, who holds the same as trustee for E. M. Bacon and E. G. Graves and others. “15. I further find as a matter of fact, that none of the land in suit was actually surveyed upon the ground by the deputy surveyor who purported to have done so; but they merely copied in the office of the surveyor of the Palo Pinto Land District the field notes of the 6 Elgin survey.’ “In July, 1873, the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company located certificates in Scurry, Borden, Howard, Kent, and Fisher Counties, on lands known as blocks 27 and 97 of the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company survey, including that sued for herein, which said block 97 comprises surveys from 1 to 955, all of which were by virtue of land certificates issued to said company by the Commissioner of the General Land Office of the State of Texas, and the field notes thereof bear date ‘July, 1873,’ and were returned in the surveyor’s office during the month of-, 1873, and were filed in the General Land Office November 20 and 26, 1873; and all the lands in this suit were and are within the Texas & Pacific Railway 80-mile reservation, marked by the act of the Legislature passed May 2, 1873. “ The above survey is the ‘ Elgin survey,’ the field notes of which were adopted by the surveyor of Palo Pinto Land District and his deputies in making out the field notes of the land applied to be purchased by Bacon and Graves. Blocks 97 and 27 were actually surveyed on the ground by Elgin in the manner in which it has been customary by surveyors in Texas to survey large bodies of land; that is, by running the outside boundary lines of the blocks, or a part of them, putting up permanent landmarks, and leaving the interior lines without running. These blocks, in writing up field notes, were divided into 640 acres surveys, and the interior surveys were made without actually running the lines; and Elgin did not run all the lines of any section in blocks 27 and 97, unless, as he says, it was done by accident. The field notes of said blocks 27 and 97 have remained on file in the General Land Office since they were filed therein, and said lands are platted on the maps of said office. There are 33,280 acres of land in block 27, and 611,000 acres in block 97. “ 16. Deputy surveyors Berry and Williams had, prior to the adoption of the field notes for Bacon and Graves, run lines and ascertained corners in blocks 27 and 97, and found them to be as correct as any work of that character in that part of the State, and were satisfied as to the substantial accuracy of said surveys. Said surveys, as far as marked lines and corners were concerned, and in accuracy of work, were equal to or better than any other surveying in that part of the State, except that done for the Texas & Pacific Railway, which was unusually accurate. “ 17. In December, 1882, and in January, February, and March, 1883,, Joel McKee was the surveyor of the Palo Pinto Land District, and E.- A. Williams and H. M. Berry were deputy surveyors under him. “ 18. I find, that at the time E. G. Graves entered into the agreement with E. M. Bacon to purchase these lands, to-wit, on the 29th and 30th of November, 1882, he was an employe in the General Land Office at Austin as draftsman, and that he drew his salary for the entire month of November, 1882, as well as for the preceding ten months. “ 19. Bacon and Graves have neither paid nor offered to pay taxes on said land or any part thereof at any time, nor have they rendered any part of such land for taxes for any year, except for 1891, when it was rendered by C. C. Gibbs, trustee. “ 20. Bacon and Graves, at the time of the application by them to purchase said lands, were not responsible parties, being worth less than $3000 each, and had made no arrangements to procure more than enough money to pay for the filing, etc., of the field notes, and afterwards, in February or March, 1883, the promise of a loan of $5000. “21. The Colorado River is one of the great rivers of the State. It runs through about twenty sections of block 97. It is not a navigable stream where it flows through said block, but it is permanent water. “ 22. The Elgin survey of block 97, adopted by the deputy surveyors, Williams and Berry, is not made in conformity to the fifty-cent act of 1879 and its amendment in 1881, as the surveys made on the Colorado River, which is permanent water, cross the same and have a greater frontage thereon than one-half the square of such survey, and that, too, where they are not surrounded by older surveys. “ 23. On the 16th of May, 1883, Bacon and Graves tendered to the Treasurer of the State $80,640, and on May 19, 1883, tendered to said Treasurer the further sum of $104,640, in payment of surveys numbers 118 to 291, inclusive, block G, in Borden and Scurry Counties; surveys numbers 1 to 119, inclusive, block M, Scurry County; surveys numbers 1 to 52, inclusive, block N, Scurry County; surveys 1 to 117, inclusive, block B, Scurry County; and surveys 1 to 135, inclusive, block G, Borden and Scurry Counties; which said tenders were refused and declined by said Treasurer. In January, 1891, Bacon and Graves paid to said Treasurer on said lands $149,320, which was received by him under protest. “24. In December, 1882, the land in controversy was worth $1 per acre. At present it is worth $2 per acre for dry land, and $3 per acre for watered land. “ From the foregoing facts I conclude, that the plaintiff, The State of Texas, is entitled to recover in this suit on each of the following grounds, to-wit: “1. Bacon and Graves were not responsible parties at the time they applied to purchase this land, and could not purchase under the law. “ 2. They did not comply with the law by having the land surveyed as was required by law, and therefore could not purchase it. “ 3. The survey as adopted was not made in accordance with law; is incorrect—totally so—in having a greater frontage on permanent water than is permitted under the Acts of 1879 and 1881. ‘ ‘ 4. Bacon and Graves have never paid or offered to pay for said land until long after the expiration of the time allowed and required by law. The purported surveys of many of the sections of land, for which they tendered payment on May 19, 1883, were made after the fifty-cent act was repealed, and Bacon and Graves did not separate or offer to separate, in their tender, the surveys made before the repeal from those made after, and there was consequently no legal tender. “5. At the time Graves entered into an agreement with Bacon to purchase these lands, he was an employe of the General Land Office, and his action was against the civil and criminal laws of the State. “6. I further hold that the State is not bound to return the money paid in January, 1891, to entitle it to a judgment for the land.” T. D. Cobbs, for appellant C. C. Gibbs; Hancock, Shelley & Hancock, R. H. Looney, and (on motion for rehearing) Walton, Hill & Walton, for appellants, Bacon and Graves. 1. Validity of the Surveys: A legal survey is a description of land for its identification, rather than the actual work done by the surveyor to enable him to give such a description. Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 393. 2. The surveys made for Bacon and Graves in this case were in strict compliance with the law; and if not so made in all respects and particulars, they can not be made to suffer for the acts of the public officer.

O’Sullivan, 61 Texas, 595; Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 397; Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284. 3. The question arises as to whether or not a legal survey can be made by adopting another survey. In the case of Horton v. Pace, 9 Texas, 84, the court say: “ It was competent for the surveyor to adopt that survey for the plaintiff, and the case of Lynn v. Scott has been relied on as authority. We do not question the surveyor’s right to adopt a previous survey that he thinks correct, as was done in that case.” The right to adopt field notes depended only upon the surveyor’s belief in the correctness of the field notes which he adopted. The case of Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Texas, 231, is to the same effect; as also those of Lake v. Wafer, 16 Texas, 570; Styles v. Gray, 10 Texas, 506; and Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 392. 4. This brings -us to the question as to whether or not the surveyors could lawfully write field notes from the data they had in their possession, obtained from actual knowledge of the surveys, which they had run and knew to be correct. All of the decisions hold that such could be done. This rule was expressly recognized in Jones v. Burgett, 46 Texas, 292, and Doswell v. De la Lanza, 20 Howard, 33, as well as in many other ■cases. 5. Section 7 of the Act of July 14, 1879, under which these lands were purchased, provides: “It shall be the duty of the Commissioner of the General Land Office to give such general and specific instructions to surveyors, in relation to the surveying of the public lands, under the provisions of this act, as may best subserve the interests of the State, and carry into force and effect the intent and purpose of this act.” It will be observed, that under the provisions of the very act which offered these lands for sale, it was the duty of the Commissioner of the General Land Office to formulate rules and give instructions to surveyors. It is to be presumed, that the Commissioner, in obedience to the law, gave such general and specific instructions as were deemed by him necessary, and that the surveyors followed the instructions given, and that these surveys have been made in accordance therewith. 6. Contractor Thomson surveyed 1,000,000 acres for the University. Land Commissioner Walsh deemed it of no importance whether the corners to each 640 acres survey were established before or after the contractor obligated himself to establish them. Contractor Thomson had done a great deal of this work before he took the contract, and it was distinctly understood between him and the Commissioner that he should adopt the work already done by him in returning field notes for the University under his contract. Land Commissioner Hall, under the Act of 1887, very wisely instructed State Surveyor Strong to adopt the work of the United States Government in Greer County for the State, in so far as it could be done under that provision of our law that requires surveys on navigable streams to front thereon only the half of the square thereof. The instructions were to practically adopt the whole of the United States survey of Greer County. 7. The law adopted by the Revised Statutes is not more exacting than the old law. 8. Article 3908, Revised Statutes, was a continuation of the law then in force with reference to making actual surveys on the ground; and was not a re-enactment of the law then in force, nor the enactment of a new law in reference thereto. It is substantially and in fact the same as the statute and the common law in force prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes. Report of Commission of Codifiers, 2 Sayles’ Civ. Stats., pp. 732, 733, 739-741; Stafford v. King, 30 Texas, 271; Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284; 1 Sayles’ Early Laws, 100, secs. 19, 20, 21; Rev. Stats., Final Title, secs. 19, 23. 9. An actual survey has been required by all our laws providing for the disposition of the public domain; but while this is true, still the Supreme Court of the Republic and State, by one continuous line of decisions, has established a rule, that the field notes of a survey made by one surveyor may be adopted by another. Upon this rule of property the rights of appellants in this case depend, and under it the officers of the State acted in making appellants’ surveys. Jones v. Menard, 1 Texas, 789; Howard v. Perry, 7 Texas, 259; Horton v. Pace, 9 Texas, 81; Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Texas, 167; Doswell v. De la Lanza, 20 How., 29; Spencer v. Lapsley, 20 How., 264; Magee v. Chadoin, 30 Texas, 644. 10. The rule of property in this cause has all the force and effect of a statute, and is the law of the land. Certificate of the Land Commissioner.— 1, The court erred in permitting the State to introduce in evidence the certificate of the Land Commissioner as the only evidence to show that surveys 26 to 32 of block M were never returned to the General Land Office, and in finding thereon that the field notes of such surveys were not so returned. The only statement to the contrary was the certificate of W. L. McGaughey, Land Commissioner of the State. He certifies, “ That the field notes of 26 to 32, block M, both inclusive, of the alleged Bacon and Graves survey, in Scurry, Borden, and adjoining counties, were never filed in the Land Office at Austin, and are not now on file in said office, as appears from an examination of the files and other papers connected with said surveys.’ ’ 2. This officer states in his deposition, “that he has resided at Austin since the 20th day of January, 1891; holds the office of Commissioner of the General Land Office; has had very little experience in Texas; e * * experience in the General Land Office dates from January 20, 1891; * * * had very little experience in said office prior to that date.” I-Iow is it possible then for him to know that they had never been filed in the Land Office ? What record and file in his office will show that they were never filed there ? He could not speak of his own knowledge, because it was limited, as he himself stated. Buford v. Bostick, 58 Texas, 67; Rev. Stats., arts. 3805, 3910. jResponsibility of Purchaser.—The court erred in holding that Bacon and Graves were not responsible parties at the time they applied to purchase the land, because that issue had been settled by the surveyor who surveyed the lands, and could not again be raised on this trial between the parties at interest. If the law intended the purchaser should be responsible, meaning thereby financially able individually to pay the money at the time the application was made, it was folly to give the purchaser seven months, as the law did, from the date of his application to the day on which he was required to pay the money. This point is settled by the case of White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 342. Tender of Purchase Money.—The court erred in holding that Bacon and Graves never paid or offered to pay for said land until long after the expiration of the time allowed and required by law; for that defendants acquired a vested right by the survey of the lands made prior to the repeal of the law, and their right to the land could not be impaired by the law being repealed, nor by any adverse legislation in respect thereto. The tender of the money was in all respects a lawful and legal tender, as required by law for the purchase of lands, and was in all respects sufficient to pay for those surveyed both prior and subsequent to the repeal of the law. White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 342; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 5; Odom v. Carter, 36 Texas, 282. Return of Purchase Money.—The court erred in holding that the State is not bound to return the money paid in January, 1891, to entitle it to a judgment for the land. Gen. Laws 18th Leg., 113, 114; The State v. Snyder, 66 Texas, 700. 2. The State, by putting the lands on the market for sale and accepting the purchase money, is estopped from denying defendants’ right to the land without returning or offering to return the money it has received for the land, as the State can not in good conscience and equity hold the money and the land too.

Garland, 15 Vesey, 248. Form of the State’s Action.—1. The court erred in overruling defendants’ general and special exceptions as contained in defendants’ first amended original answer, for the following reasons: First. Because the petition does not give any proper description of the land or state a proper cause of action. Second. Because the same is purely an action in trespass to try title to lands and for rents, and is such an action as is unknown, except by statute; is not afforded to and can not be maintained by the State against a citizen, for the State can neither be ejected nor dis-seized of her land or her public domain. Third. The petition contained no allegation of fraud or any specific wrongful acts, such as would warrant an action for the recovery strictly of the land in the simple statutory form of action provided by statutory law for one citizen to sue another. Fourth. Because the petition should have been in the nature of a bill in equity, showing the nature and character of plaintiff’s claim and defendants’ wrongful acts, etc., so that defendants could know and would be put upon notice of what charges they were expected to meet, and not be in total ignorance of the claims which the State, in her sovereign capacity, through her Attorney-General, might be permitted to raise on the trial of said cause, thus placing the citizen at a great disadvantage in a contest with the State. 2. There is no power or authority in the State, through her Attorney-General, to institute an action purely of trespass to try title to lands and for rents under our law; for the State, in legal contemplation, could not be ousted of its possession by a citizen; and in such an action, if permitted to bring an action purely of trespass to try title, no issue is admissible except one purely of title.

Validity of the Surveys.—1. The important question is, whether, under the peculiar facts of this case, applicants may lawfully purchase public lands under the Act of July 14, 1879, as amended March 11, 1881, without having the lands surveyed for them in the field. It is admitted here, that there was no actual survey for Bacon and Graves. The field notes were copied literally by the deputy surveyor Berry from the Elgin survey (which we will show was illegal and void), and were, with only a few exceptions, also literally copied therefrom by the deputy surveyor Williams. Each of these deputies testified that he had done surveying on block 97, of which this land was only a part, but neither could say whether he ever tested the accuracy of the Elgin survey of this particular land. In other words, their theory is, that having tested some of Elgin’s work and found it substantially correct, they concluded that all of it was, and consequently adopted it. 2. It is submitted that the second conclusion of law found by the trial court is correct. In order to give them a right to purchase, the statute requires that persons desiring to do so shall cause the land “to be surveyed by the authorized public surveyor of the county or district in which said land is situated.” It is only when the applicant has caused a survey of the land to be made for him that the proposition of the State is accepted, and contractual relations are formed. The State’s requirements must be strictly complied with before any rights attach. It has demanded a survey for the particular purchaser, and it has the right to insist that the demand shall be strictly met. That a survey of the land has been previously made is of no consequence. In view of the many and gross inaccuracies in surveys throughout the State, known to the Legislature and this court, it was but a measure of caution and protection against land spoliation that a survey for the person desiring to purchase should in all cases be made. The law having made it a prerequisite that the person desiring to purchase “ may do so by causing the tract or tracts which such person desires to purchase to be surveyed,” it is not competent for any executive officer or the courts to dispense with the requirement and substitute for it a survey made many years before for another person or corporation. Act of July 14, 1879, sec. 2; White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 340; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 5. 3. The State has the right to insist that its proposition, that the proposed purchaser shall himself cause the land to be actually survejmd in the field, shall be strictly met. Without it there is no contract. State v. Work, 63 Texas, 148; White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 340; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 5; Yosemite Valley Cases, 15 Wall., 77; Frisbie v. Whitney, 9 Wall., 187; Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U. S., 24; Anson on Con., 15; Bish. on Con. (old ed.), sec. 698; Bish. on Con. (enlarged ed.), secs. 323, 330, 334, 1420. 4. The proposition of the State, that if they would cause the land to be surveyed they might purchase it, was accepted by Bacon and Graves by filing their application, but was not performed. They say, in effect, we will not cause the land to be surveyed, but will cause the surveyors to adopt and certify to a previous survey which they believe is correct. This is not sufficient, and is not a performance of the contract between the parties. “ If one of two parties is to do a thing, whereupon the other is to do something else, the former can not sue the latter for nonperformance until he has himself performed. Nor will it suffice that the thing which the plaintiff has done is as good as what he agreed; it must be the particular thing.” Bish. on Con. (enlarged ed.), sec. 1420, and authorities above cited. 5. To require the purchaser to cause a survey to be made, means a survey on the ground. The law requires this; and these deputies falsely certified that the “ survey was actually made in the field.” Rev. Stats., art. 4025. Nor can any other construction be placed upon the language of this court in the “agreed” Jumbo Cattle Company case, 79 Texas, 11, where it would not permit so grave a matter to pass unnoticed. Rev. Stats., art. 3908, par. 8; Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284; Baxter v. Traver, 130 U. S., 236. 6. It is, however, argued by appellants, that because Commissioners Walsh and Hall, in one instance each, permitted the adoption of surveys, it should be done here. Walsh acted under the only statute which expressly authorizes the adoption of surveys, as we have shown (2 Sayles’ Civil Statutes, articles 4025, 4026, 4037a); and Hall acted under a statute which clothed him with discretion as to the character of the surveys to be made. 2 Sayles’ Civ. Stats., arts. 4038, et seq. Both Walsh and Hall testify that they never authorized the adoption of surveys under the fifty-cent act. Though the surveyors were officers of the State, it was incumbent upon Bacon and Graves to see that their acts were in accordance with law. Land Co. v. Thomson, 83 Texas, 169. 7. Bacon and Graves never surveyed, actually or otherwise, the land according to the acts of 1879 and 1881 offering the land for sale, but simply had the surveyors copy field notes and pretend to adopt them ; and therefore they never complied with the State’s offer, and are not entitled to the land. 8. The custom of running outside and base lines and doing the other work in the office can not supersede the statutes and decisions. Laws, on Usages and Customs, 455, sec. 218; Bish. on Con. (enlarged ed.), secs. 453, 454, 460. What work was done by Elgin was absolutely void, for he was surveying out of his district. Cox v. Railway, 68 Texas, 226. The land was also in the Texas & Pacific reservation in July, 1873. Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 5. 9. If the court should hold that Elgin made a survey of the land in 1873, then it is submitted that the survey, as purported to have been made by him, was grossly inaccurate and incorrect, and for this reason could not be adopted. Neither the State nor other party can be forced to accept the adoption of these surveys. Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 396. 10. The cases cited by appellants in their contention for the adoption of the field notes are based upon surveys prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes, when the requirements for surveys were not so strict as now, as said by Mr. Justice Stayton in Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 397. Compare 1 Pasch. Dig., arts 4522, 4523, 4528; Rev. Stats., art. 3908; Thomson v. Railway, 68 Texas, 397; Sanborn v. Gunter, 84 Texas, 284; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 11. The manner of making surveys was not so specific as now. Since then the Revised Statutes have been adopted, and an actual field survey is required by article 3908, subdivision 8; permanent monuments and objects must be put up, and chain carriers must be sworn. Under these mandatory statutes a surveyor may not throw away his chain and compass and make surveys with an adjustable belief. Certificate of the Land Commissioner.—The court properly admitted in evidence the certificate of the Land Commissioner, who gave not his own knowledge of the transaction, but the result of an investigation of “ the files and other papers connected with said survey.” Rev. Stats., art. 2253. But if it shall be thought that the court erred in admitting the certificate, the error did not injuriously affect appellants, because the court having correctly held, upon several fundamental grounds, that appellants never lawfully purchased the land, this question is immaterial. Tripis v. Weslow, 18 S. W. Rep., 684. Again, there being sufficient •evidence to support the finding that these field notes were not returned, without considering the certificate, it will be presumed that it was disregarded by the court in rendering judgment. Lindsay v. Jaffray, 55 Texas, 639. Graves an JSmploye of the Land Office.—1. The court correctly found, that at the time Graves entered into the agreement with Bacon to purchase these lands, he was an employe of the General Land Office, and his action was against the civil and criminal laws of the State. 2. It is expressly agreed, that “ Graves was employed in the General Land Office at Austin as draughtsman for the entire year 1882, except for the month of December, and that he drew his salary for the entire month of November, 1882, as well as the preceding ten months,” which necessarily includes the 29th and 30th days of November, 1882. 3. The resignation of Graves was presented and its receipt acknowledged November 29, but neither the one nor the other states when it was to become effective. The agreement above quoted is an explicit interpretation by the appellants that he continued in the service of the State during the entire month of November. Without this interpretation, the result would be the same; for by continuing to draw the salary.Graves is estopped to deny employment. To be complete a resignation must intend and must in fact give up the office. He must let go the salary as well as the authority of the office. Mecli. on Pub. Off., secs. 394, 411. 4. The court also correctly found, that Graves entered into an agreement with Bacon to purchase the land while the former was employed in the Land Office. Bacon testified, that “I had talked the matter over with Graves frequently prior to the 3Qth day of November, 1882. Mr. Graves and myself left Austin on the 29th or 30th of November for Palo Pinto, for the purpose of entering into the business of purchasing the land in controversy.” Rev. Stats., art. 3982; Act of July 14,1879, sec. 3; Penal Code, arts. 118, 119; The State v. Work, 63 Texas, 148; The State v. Thompson, 64 Texas, 690; Bish. on Con. (enlarged ed.), secs. 471, 476. Tender and Payment of Purchase Money.—1. The payment of the money to the Treasurer in January, 1891, was long after the time in which it was required to be paid, and after the repeal of the law, and the Treasurer was not authorized to accept it or bind the State. His action was a nullity. Act 1879, sec. 5; Laws 1883, p. 2; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 12; Bish. on Con. (enlarged ed.), sec. 993. 2. There was no legal tender in' 1883. It will be observed by the court, that on December 1, 1882, Bacon and Graves applied to purchase 61 about 550 sections” of land in one solid body. This land purports to have been surveyed into four blocks between January 17 and 24, 1883, by only two deputy surveyors, and aggregates about 375,040 acres. This transaction, if good for any purpose as a contract, was intended as an entirety and should stand and fall as such. The law authorizing the sale was repealed at 1:30 p. m., January 22, 1883, and took effect from its passage. As a matter of law, therefore, all surveys made on January 22, 1883, and those made after that day, are illegal and void. That is to say, the act having taken effect from its passage, included the day of its passage in its operation. O’Connor v. Towns, 1 Texas, 114; Arnold v. United States, 9 Cranch, 104; Tomlinson v. Bullock, L. R. 4 Q. B. Div., 230; Matter of Howes, 21 Vt., 619; Matter of Welman, 20 Vt., 653. 3. There are 52 sections in block N. A tender in bulk was made on all of them. Sections 1 to 12 purport to have been surveyed January 23; as also some of the sections in other blocks. It was the duty of appellants, if in fact they had a contract with the State, to tender the precise amount due for the particular sections of land to which they were entitled, they being separable contracts and obligations. Act March 11, 1881, sec. 6; 2 Pars, on Con., 6 ed., *641. 4. If the rule be adopted, that the contract to purchase the solid body of land must stand in its entirety, then there was no legal tender. The land was described in the application by metes and bounds. It is claimed to have been afterward surveyed into four blocks of 586 surveys, or 375,040 acres. The tender was only for 370,560 acres, or a difference against the State of $2240 and 4480 acres. 2 Pars, on Con., 6 ed., *639, *640. Pesponsibitity of Purchaser.—1. Bacon and Graves were not responsible parties at the time they applied to purchase the land. The surveyor, in the first instance, may pass upon the responsibility of applicants, but his action is not conclusive upon applicants or the State. The former, in a proper case, may compel him by mandamus to file the application and make the survey; and the State, whatever may be the limitations upon its rights, may at least repudiate his official acts when they are designedly against its interests with the knowledge and sanction of the applicants. Laws 1879, p. 48, sec. 3; White v. Martin, 66 Texas, 342, 343; Railway v. Locke, 63 Texas, 623. 2. Section 3 of the Act of July 14, 1879, provided, that “it shall be the duty of the surveyor to whom application is made by responsible parties to survey the lands designated within three months from the date thereof.” This means that the party must be able at the time of the application to pay for the surveying and filing of the field notes and to pay for the land. Bacon and Graves were not able. Return of Purchase Money by State.—1. The court correctly held that the State is not bound to return the money paid to the Treasurer in 1891 before it can sue for and recover the land. The presumption that the-State will do justice, and if the land is recovered the money will be repaid* can not be questioned in the courts. The State v. Thompson, 64 Texas,. 690; The State v. Snyder, 66 Texas, 687; Borden v. Houston, 2 Texas* 611; Randolph v. The State, 73 Texas, 485; Bates v. The Republic, 2 Texas, 618; United States v. Coal Co., 137 U. S., 170. 2. The doctrine of estoppel invoked by appellants in this connection is inapplicable to the State. Bish. on Con. (enlarged ed.), sec. 993; Day Co. v. The State, 68 Texas, 541, 553; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas* 12; Sherman v. Buick, 93 U. S., 209; Moffatt v. United States, 112 U. S., 24. 3. The Act of April 14, 1883, is not applicable to this case. By the-caption and preamble, it is shown to have reference only to special funds-paid in error; but if deemed applicable, it is void. Const., art. 8, sec. 6; Treasurer v. Wygall, 46 Texas, 465; The State v. Snyder, 66 Texas, 700. 4. The payment of the money in January, 1891, was unauthorized. The receipt by the Treasurer can not bind the State, and his act was a nullity. The law, and not the act or advice of any officer, must govern. Laws 1879, sec. 5, p. 48; Laws 1883, p. 2; Cattle Co. v. Bacon, 79 Texas, 12; Bish. on Con. (enlarged ed.), sec. 993. Form of State’s Action.— 1. The objections to the form of the State’s-action in trespass to try title are not tenable. The petition was not excepted to because of the insufficient description of the land. Besides, the description of the land in the petition is a verbatim copy of that in the application to purchase. 2. The State may maintain an action of trespass to try title, and it is-not necessary to allege the nature of its title or the grounds relied upon for recovery. Rev. Stats., arts. 4784, 4786; The State v. Delesdenier, 7 Texas, 96; Daingerfield v. Paschal, 20 Texas, 537; Day Co. v. The State, 68 Texas, 535. 3. Where no exception is made by law, the State must prosecute its suits for civil rights in the same way and under the same forms of remedy prescribed by the laws of the forum for individual suitors. The State v. Kroner, 2 Texas, 492; The State v. Delesdenier, 7 Texas, 96; The State v. Snyder, 66 Texas, 695, 700. 4. It is not necessary for the State, or any plaintiff, in an action of' trespass to try title, to plead the evidence or elements of title relied on.. Hughes v. Lane, 6 Texas, 289; Day Co. v. The State, 68 Texas, 535; Sedg. & Wait on Trial Title to Land., secs. 439-445."
"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. On the first day of March, 1884, John L. Cleveland, then the owner of the land in controversy, executed to W. F. Sommerville a trust deed in the nature of a mortgage on said land, to-wit, a tract of 198 acres, situated in Johnson County, to secure George Halley and Alexander Gilroy in the payment of a certain promissory note for $1200, payable to their order in Fort Worth, Texas, with interest at 11 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually on the first days of March and September of each year, according to the terms of ten interest coupon notes thereto annexed; with the stipulation that if any one of said interest coupons should remain unpaid for five days after maturity, then, at the option of said Halley & Gilroy, or the holder of said promissory note, the whole principal, with interest then accrued, should at once become due and payable, and that the holder might proceed to collect the same by sale under the deed of trust. It was further provided in the deed of trust, that in default of payment as aforesaid, said trustee was authorized, at the request of Halley & Gilroy, or other holder of the note, at any time made after default, to sell the property in controversy at private sale, or to the highest bidder for cash in hand or on credit, at the court house door in Tarrant County, Texas, at public outcry, within lawful hours, after giving public notice of the time, place, and terms of said public sale and of the property to be sold, either by publication in a newspaper or by posting a notice on the court house door of said county for twenty days prior to the sale. In negotiating the loan secured by the deed of trust, Sommerville acted as the agent of Halley & Gilroy, who resided beyond the seas. The deed of trust was promptly and duly recorded in Johnson County. Thereafter, in May, 1884, Cleveland conveyed the land to W. D. Hudson, who, in July of the same year, conveyed it to B. F. Hudson for a recited consideration of $1000 cash and a purchase money note for $2500. This note afterwards became the property of appellee, the First National Bank of Cleburne, upon which, in 1887, it brought suit against B. F. Hudson to foreclose the vendor’s lien on the land. Upon this judgment an order of sale was issued, and on the first Tuesday in June, 1887, was executed by a sale of the land to the said bank. No deed was introduced in evidence conveying the property in controversy to the bank, nor was there any proof of the payment of its bid of $100 at the sheriff’s sale; but the return on the order of sale showed that that sum was bid by the bank, and that the property was struck off to it at said sale as the highest and best bidder. On the first day of June, in the year 1887, prior to the sale under the order of sale, said Sommerville, by virtue of said deed of trust, sold the same property before the court house door of Tarrant County, within the hours prescribed by law, to the highest bidder for cash, after posting notices, as required in the deed of trust; at which sale appellant, E. E. Chase, became the purchaser at the sum of $1376, which was the amount of principal, interest, and costs due from said Cleveland. Of this sum only $133 was then paid in cash. There seems to have been an understanding between said Sommerville and Chase, as we infer from the evidence, though not admitted by them, that Sommerville, who was still the agent for Halley & Gilroy in loaning and collecting money for them, as such agent, would lend to Chase the balance of said bid, to be secured by a mortgage on the property, which was soon thereafter accomplished, a deed in pursuance of the sale under said trust deed having been duly executed to Chase upon his paying the $133 cash. The sale under the deed of trust was not advertised and made until more than five days after the maturity and default in the payment of the interest coupon due March 1, 1887, which remained unpaid at the time of the sale. Prior to any steps taken on the part of Sommerville to sell under the deed of trust, his local agent in Johnson County, who had negotiated this loan, notified Cleveland and Hudson of the default, and that the land would be sold unless the interest was paid. Appellee had no knowledge or notice of the default or sale until afterward. Upon learning of the sale, appellee offered to pay to appellant the whole amount due upon the mortgage, including all sums paid out by appellant, and offered on the trial to do the same, which offers appellant declined. The property was shown to be worth from $2500 to $3000. The original note executed by Cleveland, which was secured by the deed of trust, was not payable until five years after its date; and likewise the subsequent note executed by Chase, secured by his deed of trust on the land, had five years to run. Appellant took possession of the land under his purchase at the trustee’s sale, and thereafter appellee brought this suit in trespass to try title, setting up in its petition irregularities and fraud in the sale under the deed of trust, praying to have it set aside and to be permitted to redeem the land from the original mortgagee; appellant pleading not guilty. The case was submitted to the jury on the alleged irregularities in the sale, the proof being properly deemed insufficient by the trial court to warrant the submission of the issue of fraud. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee for the land and for $200 rents, and for appellant $1200 (owing to Halley & Gilroy) with interest, $291.35; also $176 paid Sommerville, amounting, with interest, to $211.49; total, $1702.84. This verdict was approved and judgment entered in favor of appellee for the land, subject to the mortgage executed by appellant to Halley & Gilroy for $1200; also decreeing that appellant recover of appellee the sum of $302.84 with 8 per cent interest per annum, to be paid by appellee upon taking possession of the land. From this judgment E. E. Chase appeals. We have reached the conclusion, after a careful consideration of the facts contained in the record, that the trustee’s sale under which appellant deraigns title was not attended with such irregularity as would warrant its being set aside, even in a direct proceeding for that purpose, with all parties at interest before the court. The charge of the court, of which complaint is made, must have conveyed to the minds of the jury the impression that some sort of declaration on the part of Halley & Gilroy of their option to treat the principal debt as due upon default in the pa)rment of the interest was necessary before their agent and trustee, Sommerville, could proceed to sell under the deed of trust. We are of opinion that no such declaration was essential to the exercise of such power. Leonard v. Tyler, 60 Cal., 299; Harper v. Ely, 56 Ill., 179. According to our construction of the deed of trust and of the law, Sommerville, as the agent of Halley & Gilroy, had the power, upon default in payment of the interest, to exercise for his principals, and did in this case exercise for them, this right of electing to treat the principal debt as due; and by proceeding to advertise and sell the property this purpose was manifested. The charge also, in effect, instructed the jury, that if at the public sale; which was advertised and made ostensibly as a cash sale, there was a private understanding between Sommerville and Chase that only a part of the bid of the latter was to be paid cash, and that the balance was to be carried by Halley & Gilroy as a loan, the amount of the bid to cover the entire debt with interest and costs, this would render the trustee’s sale invalid. This charge is also complained of, and we are of opinion that it contains error. Our view is,, that where a trust deed authorizes a sale for cash, and the trustee, who is also the mortgagee or the agent of the mortgagee, purporting to sell for cash, gives credit, or has an understanding with the bidder that credit will be given him on part of his bid, in order to induce him to make the property bring the full amount of the debt secured, this is not to the injury of the mortgagor or those claiming under him, and will not avoid the sale. Marsh v. Hubbard, 50 Texas, 203; Ballinger v. Bourland, 87 Ill., 513; Burr v. Borden, 61 Ill., 391. No other alleged irregularities were or should have been submitted to the jury; and our conclusion is, that those submitted, if irregularities at all, were not such as appellee could justly complain of. We are further of opinion, that if there had been any such irregularities as would avoid the sale in a direct proceeding, without Halley & Gilroy before the court, appellee could not obtain that relief. « Delivered December 6, 1892. In order to set aside a sale in a direct proceeding for that purpose, the purchaser at such sale must be placed in statu quo. We can not perceive how, under the peculiar facts of this case, this could be done without Halley & Gilroy before the court. Certain it is that it was not done by the judgment rendered. Appellant has the return of his money with 8 per cent interest adjudged to him, but he is not released and could not be released, without Halley & Gilroy before the court, from his obligation to pay them 81200, which would certainly make him liable for whatever should remain unpaid upon the sale of the property under the mortgage executed by him, should appellee fail to redeem the land from the mortgage. Whether appellee, in the absence of a deed from the sheriff, without showing the payment of its bid, or showing that a credit of the amount thereof was entered on its judgment, could maintain this suit may be doubted, but as it is unnecessary in this case to pass upon that issue we leave it undetermined. Our conclusion is, that the court should have instructed the jury to return a verdict for appellant, and therefore that the judgment should be reversed and here rendered for appellant for the land in controversy. Reversed and rendered. A motion for rehearing in this case was overruled","E. E. Chase v. The First National Bank of Cleburne. No. 43. 1. Deed of Trust Sale — Power of Trustee as Agent. — Where a deed of trust, in which the trustee is also the agent of the beneficiaries, provides that upon default in any interest payment the beneficiaries may, at their option, elect to treat the principal debt secured as due, and sell the property, such election may be made by such trustee and agent on behalf of his principal, and need not be formally declared by them or by him; the election being sufficiently made by the trustee advertising the property for sale. 2. Same — Extending Credit on Sale for Cash. — Where a trust deed authorizes a sale for cash, and the trustee, who is also the mortgagee or the agent of the mortgagee, purporting to sell for cash, gives credit or has an understanding with the bidder that credit will be given him on part of his bid, in order to induce him to make the property bring the full amount of the debt secured, this is not to the injury of the mortgagor or those claiming under him, and will not avoid the sale. 3.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. It seems that on the 23d day of July, 1888, E. G. Puckett executed a deed of trust on a stock of drugs to appellant as trustee, to secure a debt due by him to Behrens & Castles, of Waco, Texas, amounting to the sum of $312.83, with interest from July 21, 1888, at 12 per cent per annum. By the terms of said deed in trust the trustee was empowered to at once take sole and exclusive charge and possession of said property, to the exclusion of the mortgagor and all other persons, and the same sell for cash with all reasonable dispatch, at the usual selling market price thereof, and the proceeds of sale were to be applied, first, to the payment of a reasonable compensation to himself for his services in conducting said sale at the rate of $25 per month; second, to the payment and discharge of all accrued and accruing rents of the store house in which said goods were situated or might thereafter be situated; third, to the payment of the debt to Behrens & Castles; and as soon as all of said indebtedness was paid off, such deed of trust and all therein contained was to become null and void; but if within six months from the date thereof said trustee had not in the manner aforesaid fully paid off and discharged said indebtedness, then said trustee should advertise all of said property for ten days, by posting three written notices of sale at three public places in Hill County, Texas, and sell the same at the court house door in Whitney, where said goods were then situated, at public vendue to the highest bidder for cash, and with the proceeds of sale pay such indebtedness in the order above named; and it was further stipulated that the residue, if any, should be paid over to the mortgagor or his heirs and assigns. On the 10th day of August, 1888, and before the debt to Behrens & Castles had been satisfied, appellee sued out, in the County Court of Hill County, a writ of attachment against Puckett for the sum of $279.80, and had the same levied upon the stock of drugs conveyed to appellant as aforesaid. Appellant filed his claim bond, and this suit is for the trial of the rights of property thereon. The issues tendered raised the question as to the validity of said deed in trust, plaintiffs alleging that it had been made in fraud of the creditors of Puckett. On the trial of the case in the court below the claimant offered in evidence the deed in trust from Puckett to him, to which plaintiff objected, for the reason that “ it showed on its face that it was void as to creditors, in so much as it directed the trustee, Greer, to pay to the mortgagor all of the proceeds of the sale of the goods left in his hands after the satisfaction of the claims set out in said trust deed.” In the bill of exceptions it is recited, that “ the court sustained the objection of- plaintiff without evidence, subject, however, to a determination of the issue of the solvency or insolvency of E. G. Puckett at the time of the making of the trust deed; holding that in case the evidence showed that E. G. Puckett was solvent at said time the instrument would be admitted, otherwise it would be excluded; and further holding the burden of proof was upon the defendant to show the solvency of said Puckett at said time.” It may be added here that the deed in trust contained no recital as to the solvency or insolvency of Puckett. Appellant’s first assignment of error calls in question the correctness of the ruling of the court upon the introduction of the deed of trust as above set forth, and we are of opinion that the specific objection made to the introduction of this deed, as shown by the bill of exceptions, was not well taken. It will be noticed that the only objection made to the deed was that it provided for the return of the surplus, after satisfying the debts it was made to secure, to the mortgagor, and this we think was entirely proper, and is the distinguishing feature between such an instrument and an assignment. If it was only intended that this instrument should have the effect of a mortgage, the provision complained of was proper, whether Puckett was solvent or insolvent. Johnson v. Robinson & Co., 68 Texas, 399. The propositions presented by appellant, however, under this assignment seem to raise the question as to the validity of this deed in trust, had other objections been made to it; and as the case must be reversed upon grounds hereafter stated, we think it best to indicate our opinion as to the validity of the deed upon the grounds discussed in the briefs. We are of opinion, if Puckett was insolvent at the time this deed in trust was made, the provision empowering the trustee to hold possession of the goods for six months, during which time he was only authorized to sell at the usual selling market price, in connection with the great excess in the value of the goods conveyed above the debts secured, would make the deed fraudulentas to the other creditors of Puckett, who would thereby be unreasonably delayed. Gallagher v. Goldfrank, 75 Texas, 562; Gregg & Son v. Cleveland & Co., 82 Texas, 187. Where property is thus placed by an insolvent debtor in the hands of a trustee, so that his other creditors can not obtain possession thereof by means of the ordinary process for the collection of their debts, the deed must not be such as will prevent the trustee from promptly disposing of the property to pay the debt it is given to secure, and we are of opinion that an attempt by such a debtor to prevent the sale of his property for six months at other than the usual market price would of necessity be to delay and hinder his other creditors. Appellant’s second assignment of error complains of the action of the court in imposing upon him the burden of proving that Puckett was solvent at the time of the execution of the deed in trust, and we are of opinion that this assignment is well taken. It was the appellee who alleged the insolvency of Puckett and attacked the deed as being fraudulent for this reason, and we think it clear the burden was upon it to establish this fact; for if the deed upon its face was good if made by one who was solvent, but bad if made by an insolvent, certainly the presumption would be in favor of the validity of the instrument, and the burden would be upon the one alleging its invalidity. Upon the trial in the court below, appellee, for the purpose of showing that Puckett was not the owner of a certain piece of land upon which was a mill and gin, was allowed to introduce the tax rolls to show that he did not render it for taxes, and appellant’s third assignment complains of the admission of this evidence over his objection, and we are of opinion that this assignment is well taken. Appellee did not introduce the original assessment list signed by Puckett, but only the tax rolls, and we are of opinion that this could not be used as a statement made by Puckett as to his financial condition. Randidge v. Lyman, 124 Mass., 361; Adams & Co. v. Hickox, 55 Iowa, 632. Upon the trial in the court below, appellee was allowed to introduce in evidence the record of a deed from E. G-. Puckett to E. C. Puckett, conveying the land with the mill and gin thereon, referred to above, to which appellant objected because no predicate was laid for its introduction, and his fourth assignment of error complains of the action of the court in admitting this evidence, and we are of opinion that this assignment is well taken. The record- of the deed at most could only have been admitted as secondary evidence under the objection made by appellant, and it is not made to appear that E. C. Puckett, who should have possession of this deed, was beyond the jurisdiction of the court, or that appellee could not for any other reason have obtained the original. We think it clear that appellant’s objection to the record as secondary evidence should have been sustained. Where an instrument in writing which a party desires to use in evidence is in the possession of a third party, he must either have it produced under a subpoena duces tecum or show that it is beyond his power to produce it in some other way, before he will be allowed to introduce secondary evidence of its contents: Hall v. York, 16 Texas, 18. The fact desired to be proven by the introduction of this deed was the actual conveyance of the land by Puckett, and to thereby show that he was not the owner thereof at the time of the execution of the deed in trust, and for this purpose we think it clear that the deed itself was the best evidence. 1 Wliart. Law of Ev., sec. 61. By the fifth assignment of error the appellant attacks the validity of the attachment levied by appellee on the goods, on the ground that the petition filed by appellee at the time of suing out this attachment showed that the court had no jurisdiction of the case. The petition in this attachment case alleged that the plaintiff ""sold to the defendant (Puckett) goods, etc., to the amount of S279.80, and that defendant failed to pay said sum, except the sum of-dollars, paid on the-day of-, 188 — , to plaintiff’s damage §100, etc. The affidavit for attachment and the writ, however, both show the indebtedness to be §279.80, and thereafter the appellee, by leave of the court, amended its petition and showed the indebtedness to be for the same amount, and judgment was rendered for this amount upon this amended petition. Appellant’s contention is that the original petition only claimed an indebtedness of §100 at the time the attachment was issued, and the County Court had no jurisdiction of the case, and the petition could not be thereafter amended so as to support an attachment issued in a case without jurisdiction. Without deciding that the construction placed by appellant upon the original petition is the correct one, we are of opinion that the amendment cured any objection that might have been urged to it. It will be noted that the amendment was of the petition, and not of the affidavit or writ of attachment. That this can be done so as to support the attachment, we consider settled by the decisions of our Supreme Court. Tarkinton v. Broussard, 51 Texas, 550; Marx & Kempner v. Abramson, 58 Texas, 264; McDannell v. Cherry, 64 Texas; 177; Ward v. Lathrop, 11 Texas, 287. Delivered December 20, 1892. For the errors above indicated, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance with this opinion. Meversed and remanded. Chief Justice Tarlton did not sit in this case.","R. M. Greer v. Richardson Drug Company. No. 55. 1. Deed of Trust. — A provision in a deed of trust given to secure a creditor, stipulating that after satisfying the debt secured the surplus of the proceeds should be returned to the mortgagor, does not of itself render the instrument void as to other creditors. 2. Same — Hindering and Delaying Creditors. — But if the maker of the trust deed was insolvent when he made it, and it conveyed property largely in excess of the debt secured, and authorized the trustee to hold possession for as long as six months, selling at the usual market price, other creditors would be unreasonably delayed, and the instrument would be void as to them. 3. Burden of Proving Insolvency of Debtor. —Where other creditors attack such a deed of trust (which is silent as to the maker's insolvency), the burden of proving such insolvency is upon them. 4. Evidence — Tax Rolls as Proof of Insolvency. — To prove that the debtor was insolvent, the tax rolls were given in evidence to show that he did not render certain property claimed by him. The original assessment lists, signed by him, were not offered. Held, that the tax rolls could not thus be used as a statement by him of his financial condition. 5-. Deed — Predicate for Secondary Evidence. — Where a deed which a party desires to use in evidence is made t.o and in possession of a third person, the party must either have it produced under a subpoena duces tecum, or show that it is beyond his power to produce it in some other way, before he will be allowed to introduce secondary evidence of its contents. 6. Pleading — Amendment Validating Attachment. — A petition, through mistake and informality, failed to clearly state an amount within the jurisdiction of the court; but the affidavit, bond, and writ of attachment issued thereon were regular and sufficient in amount. Held, that the petition could be so amended in the amount sued for as to validate the prior attachment by curing the matter of jurisdiction. 7. Cases Approved and Followed. — As to mortgage or assignment, Johnson v. Robinson & Co., 68 Texas, 399. As to trust deed hindering and delaying creditors, Gallagher v. Goldfrank, 75 Texas, 562; Gregg & Son v. Cleveland & Co., 82 Texas, 187. As to secondary evidence of deed, Hall v. York, 16 Texas, 18. As to amendment validating an attachment, Tarkinton v. Broussard, 51 Texas, 550; Marx & Kempner v. Abramson, 53 Texas, 264; McDannell v. Cherry, 64 Texas, 177; Ward v. Lathrop, 11 Texas, 287. Appeal from Hill. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. McKinnon & Carlton, for appellant. 1. The deed of trust was not prima facie fraudulent and void in law. The fact that the instrument gave to the trustee large discretionary powers does not render it void on its face, but the question of fraudulent intent was an issue of fact to be determined from the evidence. Hoas v. Kraus, 12 S. W. Rep., 394; Jackson v. Harby, 65 Texas, 710; Stiles v. Hill, 62 Texas, 429; Scott v. McDaniel, 67 Texas, 315. 2. The deed of trust was not void, because its effect could not have been to place the property not necessary to pay the debt beyond the reach of creditors. If there were more goods transferred than was sufficient to satisfy the debt, the excess in the hands of the trustee could have been reached by levy of process, or any residue in his hands after sale could have been reached by garnishment. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., arts. 167, 2296, 2292; Scott v. McDaniel, 67 Texas, 315. 3. The court erred in putting the burden of proof upon defendant to show that at the date of the execution of the trust deed E. G. Puckett was solvent, when it was on the plaintiff to show his insolvency. Hohn v. Cook, 1 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 689. 4. The"" original petition in the cause of Richardson Drug Company v. E. G. Puckett, if it states a cause of action at all, only states a cause of action for $100, and hence the attachment writ issued for $279.80 was void. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., arts. 1195, 1187; Wood v. Evans, 43 Texas, 175; Edgar v. Galveston City Co., 46 Texas, 421; Holman v. Criswell, 13 Texas, 38; Brackett v. Devine, 25 Texas Supp., 194; Sayles’ Plead., secs. 6-9, 24, 26; Evans v. Tucker, 59 Texas, 249; Joiner v. Perkins, 59 Texas, 300. B. D. Tarlton and W. C. Morrow, for appellee. 1. If the court erred in holding the deed of trust prima facie void in law, nevertheless there was sufficient evidence to justify the court in concluding that the transfer from Puckett to Greer and the transactions between them were fraudulent and void as to appellee, a creditor; and this after considering the said deed as a part of the evidence in the case and in connection with the remaining evidence. Rev. Stats., art. 2465: Duncan v. Taylor, 63 Texas, 645; Bank v. Lovenberg, 63 Texas, 506; Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 1318, note 3; Ellis v. Mills, 28 Texas, 584. 2. The burden of proof was upon defendant to show that at the date of the trust deed E. G. Puckett was solvent. As the return of the sheriff showed that the goods levied on were in possession of Puckett, the defendant in attachment, the burden of proof on the whole case was correctly placed upon the defendant Greer, claimant of the property. Rev. Stats., art. 4830. 3. The court did not err in admitting in evidence the record of a deed from E. G. Puckett to E. C. Puckett. The evidence being on a collateral issue, and in rebuttal of the effect of oral evidence, introduced by defendant, that a deed had been executed to Puckett conveying the mill and gin property in question, the rule of secondary evidence, in which there are no degrees, does not apply. The inquiry was, not the terms of the deed, but the fact of the conveyance. 1 Greenl. Ev., secs. 89, 96. 4. The amendment of the petition was sufficient to sustain the attachment. Piggott v. Schram, 64 Texas, 450; Tarkinton v. Broussard, 51 Texas, 550; Pearce v. Bell, 21 Texas, 690; 1 Wade on Att., sec. 219; Blum v. Mays, 1 W. & W. Cond. Cases, sec. 475; Turner v. Brown, 7 Texas, 491."
