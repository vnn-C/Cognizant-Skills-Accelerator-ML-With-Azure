"HEAD, Associate Justice. On May 19, 1888, appellant F. A. Rubrecht executed to Moses Powers his two notes for $393.50 each, the first one due November 15, after date, and the other due May 15, 1889, after date, and stipulating that it “becomes due November 15, 1888, if note executed even date therewith is not paid at maturity. ’ ’ These notes were secured by a deed in trust given by said Rubrecht to R. Sarlls, trustee, upon the 160 acres of land in controversy. These notes not being paid when the first one matured, the land was sold under said deed of trust on the 22nd day of December, 1888, and appellee became the purchaser at this sale for the sum of $285, and on the 24th day of December, 1888, filed his petition in trespass to try title against said F. A. Rubrecht, claiming the land in controversy under his purchase at said sale. Appellant filed a plea of not guilty, and pleaded specially, that the land was his homestead at the time of the execution of said deed of trust and the sales thereunder; also, that prior to the execution of said two notes the said Moses Powers had sold the land in controversy, with another tract of 153 acres out of the AY. A. J. Finch survey, under execution, and then had suits pending for the recovery of said land, and said notes were executed to compromise this litigation, under an agreement that said Powers would convey back to appellant said two tracts of land, which he had failed and refused to do, and had placed it out of his power to reconvey the Finch tract by conveying it to other parties. Upon the trial of the case a written instrument under which said compromise was made was introduced, as follows: “ It is agreed and understood by and between Moses Powers and F. A. Rubrecht that they settle the suits now pending between them upon the following basis: The said Powers is to allow said Rubrecht $1000 credit upon the notes or judgments held by said Powers for the land sold to said Rubrecht by Powers for which said notes were given, and that said Rubrecht is to pay all costs accrued in said cases for sales of lands, and all other costs of whatever kind connected with said cases, together with $200 attorney fees paid by said Powers in said cases. The said amount is to be summed up by said Powers, and the said Rubrecht is to execute a good and sufficient note for the balance due, payable in six and twelve months, at 10 per cent interest, secured on 160 acres of land twelve miles east of Gainesville, known as the Elizabeth Spencer survey. AVhen this note is executed and delivered to said Powers, said suits are to be dismissed, provided entered into and signed up by the 18th of May, 1888. Said Rubrecht is to insure the house on the land in favor of said Powers. “F. A. Rubrecht, “Moses Powers, “By R. Sarlls, Attorney.” AYithout objection, however, on the trial verbal evidence was introduced by appellant which tended to show the agreement for the reconveyance of said land to be as alleged by him, but there is no allegation in the pleading giving any reason why this part of the contract was left out of the written agreement. Mrs. Caroline Rubrecht, wife of appellant F. A. Rubrecht, intervened, alleging substantially the same facts set forth in the answer of her husband. The appellee, in reply to appellant’s answer, alleged abandonment of the land in controversy by appellant as his homestead; and further, 11 that Moses Powers purchased the 153 acres of land mentioned in said answer at execution sale, but the defendant claimed that plaintiff acquired no title by such purchase, and that the land belonged to George Baker and others, and the said defendant executed a deed to said Baker and others, vesting all his title in said parties.” The court below charged fully upon the question of homestead, and also, in effect, that if it was a part of the agreement that Moses Powers should reconvey to Rubrecht the 153 acres out of the Finch survey, and had failed to do this, and plaintiff had notice of this at the time of his purchase, he could not recover, unless the jury further believed that said Powers had no title to said 153 acres, and the said Rubrecht knew he had no title to the same; then the failure of said Powers to make said deed could not avail as a defense. The verdict was in favor of appellee upon all the issues, and judgment was rendered accordingly, from which appellants prosecute this appeal. No question is made as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict upon the issue of homestead. No evidence was offered to show that appellant Rubrecht had conveyed the land to Baker as alleged by appellee, and the undisputed evidence showed that the 153 acres was purchased with the separate property of a former wife of Rubrecht, who had died leaving children. When this case was called for trial appellant presented a written application for a continuance on account of the absence of two witnesses, which in form was in compliance with the statute; but the court, instead of then acting on this application, gave appellee until the next morning to procure the attendance of the witnesses named therein, and appellant in his first assignment complains of this action of the court. Appellant shows no injury resulting to him from the course adopted, and we are disposed to commend rather than condemn this practice. Upon the appearance of tlie witnesses named in his first application for continuance, appellant made another application to postpone the trial on account of the absence of other alleged material witnesses, to obtain whose attendance he had used no diligence. He does not state in his application what he expects to prove by these witnesses, nor does he in a motion for a new trial show that he suffered any injury, from their nonattendance. The application not showing diligence under the statute, was to a great extent addressed to the discretion of the court, and we see no abuse of this discretion. Chilson v. Reeves, 29 Texas, 275. In his third assignment appellant complains of the action of the court in calling this case for trial ahead of some nonjury cases, which he contends should have been first tried; but we think the action of the court was entirely proper. Railway v. Shuford, 72 Texas, 165; Allyn v. Willis, 65 Texas, 70. Delivered November 1, 1892. Appellants’ remaining assignments relate to the action of the court in admitting in evidence the written agreement copied in the conclusions of fact set forth above, and in giving and refusing charges upon the issue raised by the parol evidence, admitted without objection, as to whether or not it was a part of the contract of settlement between Moses Powers and appellant that the former should reconvey to the latter the 153 acres out of the Finch survey. We are of opinion that the court not only did not err in admitting this contract in evidence, but that after its admission, under the pleadings in this case, it became the only evidence of the terms of settlement between the parties, and any charges upon the issue raised by the parol evidence became unnecessary. The contract upon its face purports to set forth the terms of settlement between the parties, and that this can not be contradicted, added to, or varied by parol evidence, without allegations and evidence of fraud, accident, or mistake, is well settled. Lanius v. Shuber, 77 Texas, 27; Belcher v. Mulhall, 57 Texas, 17; Heirs of Watrous v. Mc-Kie, 54 Texas, 71; Wooters v. Railway, 54 Texas, 297; Milliken v. Callahan County, 69 Texas, 206; Self v. King, 28 Texas, 552. This case can not be classed with that line of cases where the contract consists of distinct parts, and it is attempted to reduce a part only of such contract to writing. In such cases it is well settled that parol evidence may be received to prove the parts of the contract not embraced in the writing. Thomas v. Hammond, 47 Texas, 43; Railway v. Jones, 82 Texas, 161. In this case the writing upon its face appears to embrace the whole terms of settlement between the parties, and there are no allegations in the pleadings of appellant attempting to give a reason why that part of the alleged verbal contract binding Powers to reconvey the 153 acres was not included therein; nor do we find any evidence in the record justifying the contention of appellant that after its execution a new verbal one was made in its stead. Under these circumstances the writing must be held to embrace all the contract between the parties, and any errors the court may have committed in its charge upon the issues raised by the verbal' evidence must be held to have been immaterial. Upon the whole case, we are of opinion the judgment rendered by the court below should be in all things affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed.","F. A. Rubrecht et al. v. W. H. Powers. No. 17. 1. Practice — Continuance.—The defendant, late in the evening, presented a first application for continuance in statutory form, and the court, instead of then acting on it, gave the plaintiff until next morning to procure the attendance of the witnesses named therein, which it seems he did. No injury being shown to have resulted from this course, it is to be commended rather than condemned. 2. Same — Postponement — Diligence. — An application for postponement on account of the absence of witnesses, to obtain whose attendance no diligence is shown, is addressed to the discretion of the court; and no abuse of this discretion is apparent where the applicant does not state what he expects to prove by the witnesses, nor show in a motion for new trial that he has suffered injury from their nonattendance. 3. Practice — Order of Cases. — The action of the court in calling a jury case for trial ahead of prior nonjury cases on the docket, held, to have been proper. 4. Parol Evidence — Allegata and Probata. — Where a written contract given in evidence upon its face purports to set forth the terms of settlement between the parties, it can not be contradicted, added to, or varied by parol evidence, without an allegation of fraud, accident, or mistake. In the absence of such allegation it is not error in the court to refuse to charge on parol evidence which would add to or vary the terms of the writing, although such parol evidence was admitted without objection.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This is a suit brought by the appellee R. E. Brooks against J. H. Turner, R. E. Huff, and appellee J. C. Penn, in the County Court of Williamson County; plaintiff alleged to be a resident of Williamson County, defendant Turner alleged to be a resident of Rusk County, Huff of Wichita County, and Penn of Williamson County. It is alleged in the original petition, that on the 5th day of February, 1890, Turner, by his agent, Huff, by contract in writing, sold to plaintiff and Penn lots 8 and 9 in block 150 in the town of Wichita Falls; Huff at the time executing to the vendees the following receipt or contract of sale: “ Wichita Falls, February 5, 1890. “ Received of John C. Penn and R. E. Brooks $250 on sale of lots 8 and 9, block 150, town of Wichita Falls, Texas, sold to them for $2750, $1000 cash, $875 in six months, and $875 in twelve months, with interest at 10 per cent, grantees to pay taxes of 1890. [Signed] ‘1 Robt. E. Huff, “Agent of J. H. Turner.” This instrument is declared on as a contract to sell the lots to Brooks and Penn upon the terms stated therein; and it is alleged, that at the time the contract was entered into Brooks and Penn paid to Huff, agent, $250, to be applied on the cash payment, defendant Huff asking a few days to get the deed signed by Turner, who lived at Rusk, Texas, which was granted by the vendees. That in the meantime Brooks and Penn had made a contract of sale of the lots to William R. Emery and John A. W. Kinse, for $3000, to be paid $1250 cash, and they to assume payment of the two notes for $875 each to Turner; Huff being fully apprised of such sale at the time of his contract for Turner with Brooks and Penn. That afterward, Huff received a deed to the premises from Turner, with instructions to deliver the same to Brooks and Penn according to the contract, at which time, to-wit, on the 20th day of February, 1890, they made a tender to Huff of $750, the balance of the cash payment, and their two notes for $875 each, due in six and twelve months, with interest at 10 per cent, and at the same time demanded the deed then in Huff’s possession. That Huff, with intent to defraud plaintiff and Penn, and to appropriate the $250 paid him to his own use, refused to accept the balanee due on the purchase and the notes from Brooks and Penn, or to carry out the contract. It is alleged, that plaintiff and Penn made a second tender of the cash payment and the notes, on the 21st day of February, 1890, and demanded the deed, and Huff again refused compliance. Thereupon Brooks and Penn demanded the $250 paid Huff, which he refused to pay or return, to damage $250. That thereafter, Turner, with full knowledge of the facts stated, received from Huff $125 of the $250, and ratified the acts of Huff, to plaintiff’s damage $500. It is further alleged, that Penn, for a valuable consideration, transferred his one-half of the claim of $500 against Turner and Huff to the plaintiff Brooks, and in writing guaranteed the payment thereof to the extent of $125 with interest, whereby Penn became liable to the plaintiff for the amount. Refusal by defendants to pay any part of the amount is alleged, wherefore plaintiff prays for judgment, etc., according to the liabilities set out. Turner and Huff filed sworn pleas to the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground of their residence, and that the court had no jurisdiction of the amount claimed against Penn ($125), which were overruled. They presented demurrers to the petition upon the same ground, which were overruled. Turner excepted to the petition, because it alleged that he had made the deed and instructed Huff to deliver it, which he refused to do, for the purpose of appropriating the $250 to his own use, and no cause of action was shown against Turner. Defendants answered, that the transfer of the account by Penn to Brooks was colorable only, and was made for the purpose of giving jurisdiction to Williamson County. There were verdict and judgment for plaintiff against Turner for $306.34, and against Penn as guarantor for $125 of the amount, and in favor of Huff. Turner has appealed. It is insisted by the appellant, by his first proposition under the first assignment of error to the action of the court in overruling the exceptions and plea to the jurisdiction of the court, that the court must first have jurisdiction over the resident defendant before it can acquire jurisdiction over a nonresident joined in the suit. The proposition assumes that the court had no jurisdiction over Penn. The petition shows that plaintiff and Penn had a cause of action against Turner and Huff in amount sufficient to give jurisdiction to the County Court; that Penn had sold his half of the claim to plaintiff Brooks, and guaranteed the payment of it to the amount of $125. Penn was a proper party. The statute allowing suit to be brought in the county of the residence of one defendant makes no distinction as to the character of his liability, whether primary or as security. Rev. Stats., art. 1198, sec. 4. He must be a proper or necessary party, and not a fictitious party. Christie v. Gunter, 26 Texas, 700; Holloway v. Blum, 60 Texas, 625. But the makers of a promissory note may be sued in the precinct of the endorser, and a plea of nonresidence of the makers in the precinct of suit is not good unless it denies the jurisdiction over the endorser. Graves v. Bank, 77 Texas, 555. The'fact that Penn’s liability as guarantor was only $125, and not of itself within the jurisdiction of the court, would not deprive the court of jurisdiction of his liability, the amount of the entire liability sued on being sufficient to give the court jurisdiction. It could not be held that plaintiff would be compelled to sue the principals for the $250 or 8500 in the County Court, and after judgment sue the guarantor in the Justice Court. Even when a counter-claim is set up which exceeds the jurisdiction of the court, it controls jurisdiction, and the court can not act. 1 W. & W. C. C., sec. 273. The larger amount involved will control jurisdiction. Under the pleadings, the court had jurisdiction of the entire claim amount, and as a consequence had jurisdiction of the part guaranteed by Penn. Hamilton v. Wilkerson, 1 W. & W. C. C., secs., 556, 1165. The suit was properly brought in the county of Penn’s residence. The averment in the answer, that the purpose of the transfer was to confer jurisdiction, and that the transfer was fictitious, can not be sustained. Without dispute, the evidence shows that the transfer and guaranty were genuine and for a valuable consideration, and though the object, in part, was to give jurisdiction to Williamson County, the transfer being valid and binding, therefore was not a fraud upon the court’s jurisdiction. It was not error to overrule appellant’s exception to the petition, upon the ground that it alleged that Turner had prepared the deed and sent it on to Huff to deliver, and that he, Huff, refused to deliver it, with intent to appropriate the $250 to his own use. It is also alleged, that Turner, with full knowledge of the facts, received $125 of the amount, and ratified the acts of the agent. It is insisted that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury, as requested by Turner, to the effect, that if Brooks and Penn did not assent to the terms of the contract, as stated in the deed and letter sent by Turner to Huff, and if Turner did not assent to the contract sued on, plaintiff could not recover for any amount of money paid by Brooks and Penn to Huff. The deed sent by Turner to Huff to deliver to Brooks and Penn states as a consideration substantially the same terms as the receipt given by Huff, which shows that he had consented to the sale made by Huff. The deed was not different in any material respect from the receipt. Turner directed his agent to insert in the notes an additional obligation of the payees to pay attorney fees in case of suit on the notes, which was done, and Brooks and Penn offered to comply, but the agent refused, because of a maturity clause in the notes different from the receipt. But apart from this, Turner would be liable for the amount paid to Huff, if in fact there was no assent of the parties to the contract. The fact that there was no assent to the contract, or, in other words, that there was no consummation of the contract upon the terms proposed by either side, would furnish the best reason why Turner should not keep the money of Brooks and Penn. The evidence does not explain why he allowed his agent to retain one-half of this payment, nor does it show that he did not know the agent had received the amount. His receiving the money bound him to return it, if there was no assent to the contract. There was no error in allowing plaintiff to prove that he and Penn, during the time the sale was pending, sold the lots for $3000, a profit of $250. The evidence was not offered to recover profits, and was not admissible for that purpose, there being no allegation of such damages, and the proof failing to show that Turner knew of such sale, though Huff is shown to have known it. The testimony was offered, and was legitimate, upon the question of the value of the lots. The measure of damage for the breach of the contract was the difference in the value and the price to be paid by Brooks and Penn. The jury only allowed about $50 as damages for the breach of the contract, not the profits lost. We do not find that there was reversible error in the court’s charge directing the jury to find for plaintiff the $250 paid Huff in any event. Under the facts, the charge was proper. There is no doubt but that Turner and Huff refused to comply with the contract made by Huff as Turner’s agent when he received the money—refused by adding obligations to the agreement not in the contract with Huff; there is no doubt but that Brooks and Penn offered full compliance according to that original contract, which was rejected. This breach of the contract, or failure to fully consent to it, and his stipulating other onerous terms, gave Brooks and Penn the right to declare the original contract at an end, and gave them the right to decline making the contract as proposed, in which case they were entitled to at least the amount of money advanced on the original contract. Had this been the only question, the court should have directed the jury to find for the plaintiff the amount paid. We are of opinion that the justice of the case has been attained, and that there is no reversible error in the proceedings. The judgment is therefore affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 22, 1893.","J. H. Turner v. R. E. Brooks and J. C. Penn. No. 139. 1. Venue — Jurisdiction of County Court - - Transfer of Claim.— The petition showed that Brooks and Penn had a cause of action against Turner in amount sufficient to give jurisdiction to the County Court. Penn had sold his half of the claim to Brooks, and guaranteed payment of $125. In suit by Brooks, Penn was a proper party. The statute allowing suit in the county of the residence of one of several defendants makes no distinction as to the character of his liability, whether primary or as security. 2. Jurisdiction.—The fact that Penn’s liability was only $125, and not in itself within the jurisdiction of the County Court, would not deprive the County Court of jurisdiction of his liability, the amount of the entire liability being sufficient to give the court jurisdiction. Suit could be brought in the county of Penn’s residence. The court having jurisdiction of the entire claim, had it as to the part guaranteed by him. 3. Collusion to Give Jurisdiction. — The transfer and guaranty being genuine, and for a valuable consideration, the effect of giving jurisdiction in the court of Penn's residence would not be affected, although the object in part was to confer such jurisdiction. The transaction was not a fraud upon the jurisdiction. 4. Damages for Breach of Contract.—Agreement for purchase of land was made and signed. The purchasers made an advance payment. The vendor refused to carry out the sale by adding onerous terms. Held, that the sale failing, the vendor was liable for the difference in the value as agreed upon and the actual value of the land the subject of the contract, at least for the advance payment. Appeal from the County Court of Williamson. Tried below before Hon. D. S. Chesher. J. H. Turner, for appellant. 1. The court must first have jurisdiction over-the resident defendant before it can acquire jurisdiction over a nonresident by joining the resident defendant in the suit. If it has no jurisdiction over the amount claimed against the resident defendant, the amount claimed against the nonresident will not give the jurisdiction. Rev. Stats., art. 1198, sec. 4, and note. 2. One joint owner of an unliquidated demand can not transfer his interest to the other, and by guaranteeing the payment of a less amount than the court has jurisdiction of, thus give the court jurisdiction of nonresidents against whom they claimed the joint demand. “ No evasion or artifice will avail to defeat a party’s right to be sued in the county of his residence.” Pool v. Pickett, 8 Texas, 122; Railway v. Mangum, 68 Texas, 348; Stewart v. Gordon, 65 Texas, 347; Galbreath v. Atkinson, 15 Texas, 23; Keabadour v. Weir, 20 Texas, 255. Cochran & Brooks, for appellees. 1. Jurisdiction is determined in this instance by the residence of the parties and the amount in controversy. Our system of jurisprudence abhors a multiplicity of suits, and all parties having a substantial interest in the subject matter should be made parties. Suit may be brought in the county of the residence of either of the defendants, and the whole amount in controversy determines what court has jurisdiction, and not the amount claimed against any one of the defendants.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This appeal is from a verdict for $1100, divided equally between appellees, the father and mother of Ed. C. King, who was killed in the summer of 1888, while working in appellant’s yard at Greenville, by being crushed between the cars he was-coupling.' He was, at the time of his death, about. 19 years of age, and had been in the employment of appellant about six weeks. He was first regularly employed as freight brakeman on the road, but about three days before his death was put to work in the yard. He was killed in an attempt to couple a Miller hook to an ordinary drawhead, occasioned by their passing each other. The proof tended to show that work in the yard was more hazardous than on the road; and also that the coupling of a Miller hook to an ordinary drawhead was extra hazardous, because they were not made for each other, and were liable to pass and crush the brakeman. There was also some evidence of defects in the Miller hook, though it did not distinctly appear that these defects caused the accident. The proof tended to show, that the deceased was inexperienced in this kind of work, and that this fact, together with his minority, was known to the servants and agents of appellant who had power to employ him, and who put him to work in the yard and directed the manner of his service. The proof tended to show, that J. B. Turentine, yard foreman, who put deceased to work in the yard, warned him that the service there was more hazardous than on the road, and that he explained (in what manner and to what extent the proof does not show) the danger of coupling the Miller hook with the ordinary drawhead. It does appear from his testimony that he could not state that he informed the deceased that the Miller hook and drawhead would pass each other. The proof also tended to-show, that the Miller hook in question was the only one then in use by appellant in its Greenville yard on its standard gouge cars, it being on one of its passenger coaches. There was evidence that deceased had been employed in railroad service against the consent of his father. We conclude that the record contains evidence from which it may be inferred that deceased came to his death through the negligence of appellant, without contributory negligence on his part, and that it"" did not result from the ordinary risks assumed. The first, second, third, and fifth assignments of error question the correctness of the trial court’s rulings in admitting evidence to show that ■appellant had knowledge of the minority of the deceased. It is undisputed that A. L. Downer, who was station agent and acting yardmaster for appellant, with power to employ and discharge brakemen and switch-men, and whose business it was to employ yardmen, had knowledge at the time the deceased was employed and injured both of his minority and inexperience. J. B. Turentine, yard foreman, believing and having reason to believe that the deceased was a minor, put him to work in the yard, with the consent and sanction of Downer. If there was error therefore in the admission of any of this evidence for the purpose of bringing knowledge to Ed. Stall, train dispatcher, who first employed deceased as brakeman on the road, or for the purpose of charging appellant with knowledge through any other agent or servant, the error was harmless, because, at least through Downer and Turentine, appellant is shown to have had knowledge of this fact. The sixth, seventh, and eighth assignments of error complain of the refusal of the court below to give the first, second, third, and seventh special charges requested by appellant. In refusing these charges the judge states, among other things, that they were refused because not separately submitted. The first, second, and third seem to have been written upon a sheet of paper which contained also three other special charges, all consecutively numbered. The seventh requested charge was likewise accompanied by a separate requested instruction, numbered eighth. We think the court did not err in refusing to give these instructions for the reasons stated in connection with his endorsement of refusal. The eighth assignment of error complains of the court’s third charge. The proposition submitted under this assignment is this: “ If the servant at the time he is injured knows of the hazard attending the act, he can not recover, no matter how he came by such knowledge. It is not necessary ""that he should receive the knowledge by a special warning from the master.” This paragraph of the charge was qualified with the statement, in effect, that if the jury found that Ed. King was inexperienced in such duties, and did not know of the danger or peril attendant upon the performance of such duties, and that defendant knew of his want of experience and his ignorance, and that the injury was not caused by the fault or contributory negligence of Ed. King, the jury might find for plaintiff, provided they found the facts constituting negligence on the part of the defendant to exist. We conclude therefore that this assignment, as interpreted by the proposition under it, is not well taken. No further complaint is made of the charge, and the only remaining assignment questions the sufficiency - of the evidence to sustain the verdict. We are of opinion, that the issues were clearly and fairly submitted to the jury by the charge, and that there is evidence to support the verdict.There is therefore nothing left us but to affirm the judgment, and it is so ordered. Affirmed. Delivered January 10, 1893.","The Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. J. W. and N. A. King. No. 420. 1. Notice to Agent — Railway Company Charged with Notice, ""When.—In an action of damages against a railway company for the death of a minor who was employed as brakeman by the company, and was killed while coupling cars in its yards, proof of knowledge on the part of the acting yard master and of the yard foreman who put him to work therein of his minority and inexperience, is sufficient to charge the company with notice thereof. 2. Master and Servant—Employe Assuming Hazard of the Business.—An instruction, that if the defendant company (employer) did not inform the deceased (employe) of the hazard and danger of the employment and work at which he was killed, plaintiffs could recover for the death, is not error where it is qualified with the statement that if the jury found that the deceased was inexperienced in such work, and did not know the danger or peril attendant upon it, and that defendant knew of his want of experience and ignorance, and that the injury was not caused by the fault or contributory negligence of the deceased, then they might find for plaintiff; provided, they found the facts constituting negligence on the part of defendant to exist. on rehearing. 3.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. This suit originated in the Justice Court for precinct number 1, Wilbarger County, in which judgment was rendered in favor of appellees against appellant on‘the 30th day of September, 1891. Appellant undertook to appeal to the County Court from this judgment, and in his appeal bond described the judgment as having been rendered on the 28th day of September instead of the 30th, the correct date. In the County Court appellees moved to dismiss this appeal on account of this misdescription of the judgment, which motion was sustained by the court below and the appeal dismissed, from which this appeal is prosecuted. The appeal bond correctly described the judgment rendered in the Justice Court by the number of the case, names of the parties, the court in which it was rendered, and the amount of the judgment, the only misdescription being in the date above set forth. The decisions of our Supreme Court in the case of Railway v. Stanley, 76 Texas, 418, and of our Court of Appeals in Edwards v. Allen, 17 S. W.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. The appellant, on August 18,1890, instituted in the District Court of Anderson County a suit against appellee, administrator of the estate of T. J. Williams, deceased, and one J. M. Silliman, for the purpose of setting aside a judgment rendered by default against appellant in said court, in favor of said Williams and said Silliman, on the 23rd day of April, 1889. The judgment was for the amount of a note with interest, executed by appellant to T. J. Williams on January 11, 1886, for $900, and foreclosure of mortgage upon several tracts of land, given by appellant to secure the payment of said note. This judgment and decree settled the respective rights of the estate of Williams and of Silliman in said note and mortgage; and from that judgment L. E. Williams appealed to the Supreme Court by writ of error, and that court affirmed the judgment. Appellant’s petition contained in substance the following averments: That T. J. Williams, to whom appellant executed the note and mortgage which constituted the basis of the judgment sought to be set aside, was an attorney at law, and for many years before the note was executed, and up to the time of his death, he was appellant’s attorney and confidential adviser, and that the note was given in payment of attorney fees due from him to Williams; and that a few days after the execution of the note Williams asked appellant to execute to him a mortgage, to secure the note, on appellant’s lands, not including his homestead, and to this proposition appellant assented, and Williams wrote the mortgage on three tracts of land, one of which was a tract of 640 acres off the Sarah Hodges survey. Relying on the assurances of Williams that the mortgage did not affect or include his homestead, appellant signed and acknowledged the mortgage. That upon this tract of 640 acres was situated the homestead of appellant, which had been continuously occur piéd by himself and wife, and after the death of his wife, in 1866, by appellant and his children, for about twenty-five years previous to the execution of the mortgage, and was still occupied by himself and family; that it was the distinct understanding with Williams that his homestead was not to be included in the mortgage, but by mistake of Williams it was included; that upon calling Williams’ attention to the mistake he promptly corrected the error by executing to appellant a release to 200 acres, to be taken out of the said 640 acres, upon which the appellant’s homestead is situated, and that said Williams assured appellant that his homestead could never be subjected to the lien of said mortgage under any circumstances; that the release so executed was by Williams duly acknowledged on the day of its execution, and on same day recorded in same volume in which the mortgage was recorded. That appellant never saw the release after it was filed for record, until the institution of this suit; that he thought at the time the release was written on the back of the mortgage, and so believed until he was informed by the officer before whom the release was acknowledged, a short time before the institution of this Suit, that it was written on a separate paper from the one on which the mortgage was written; that appellant did not take the release from the clerk’s office, because,he believed that it was a part of the mortgage, and that Williams was entitled to its custody, and supposed it was in his possession. That at the time he was cited to answer the suit of the administrator, T. J.' Williams, he still believed the release was on the same paper on which the mortgage was written, and that relying on the assurances of Williams, the mortgagee, that his homestead could never be subjected to-the payment of the note, and having no defense to make against the note, he did not believe it necessary for him to make an appearance in the case or take any steps to protect his homestead from the mortgage. That the citation did not describe the lands on which the foreclosure was sought other than as three tracts of land; that he knew that there were three tracts covered by his mortgage, but he never supposed that the 200 acres out of the 640 acres of the Sarah Hodges survey, released from the mortgage, was a part of the lands which the administrator of Williams was seeking by his suit to subject to the payment of the note which was due from appellant to the estate of plaintiff’s intestate; and that appellant never knew or had reason to suspect that the decree foreclosing said mortgage rendered in said suit made said 200 acres, or any part thereof, liable for his debt to said plaintiff until about three months before he instituted this suit. That he confided in the assurance given him by Williams at the time he executed the release, and on what he then believed to be the fact, that the release was written on the same paper on which the mortgage was written; that Williams was at the time he executed the release the attorney and legal adviser of appellant, and had been for several years before, and so remained to his death. That had he known that the plaintiff was seeking to foreclose the mortgage upon his ""homestead, or had he reason to suspect that such was his object, he would have defended the suit. He charges that both the plaintiff, Williams, and the defendant, Silliman, had both actual knowledge and constructive notice before the institution of said suit that his homestead was exempt from the mortgage, and that they both knew at the time the judgment was rendered against him that he did not resist the suit because he was ignorant of their purpose to subject his homestead to the payment of said note. Appellant further averred, that when he discovered that his homestead was included in the decree of foreclosure he endeavored to induce the said Silliman and the plaintiff to release his homestead from the operation of said decree, and that said Silliman readily acceded to appellant’s request, and that the said plaintiff, who is the brother and the administrator of the estate of the said T. J. Williams, deceased, expressed his willingness to release the homestead, but said that he must first consult his counsel, and after consulting his counsel he refused to make the release. And appellant concluded with prayer, that said administrator and said Silliman might be made defendants to this suit; that the judgment rendered against him on the 23rd day of April, 1889, by default be set aside, and that he be permitted to make his defense to the suit, or that the said judgment be amended so as to release his homestead. And pending this suit appellant, by amended petition, averred that an order of sale had been issued upon said judgment, and he prayed for an injunction, enjoining the sale of his homestead; and the writ was granted and the sale of the homestead enjoined. Defendant Silliman made no appearance in the suit, but defendant Williams appeared and by his counsel filed motion to dissolve the in junetion and dismiss the suit, which motion was sustained and the injunction dissolved and appellant’s suit dismissed. The grounds upon which the defendant rests his motion are five: 1. The want of equity in the petition. 2. The suit was filed more than twelve months from the date of the judgment sought to be set aside. 3. That the grounds for injunction existed before the judgment. 4. Petitioner had a legal remedy by appeal or writ of error. 5. That petitioner shows that he was guilty of gross negligence in not making his defense, if he had one, to the suit at the time of the trial. The rule under which a court of chancery permits a judgment to be opened, after the expiration of the term of court at which the judgment was rendered, for the purpose of making defense to the suit, requires that the party seeking such relief must have a legal and equitable defense, and he must not have been guilty of culpable neglect in not making his defense; and he must further show that he has no remedy for the wrong and injury inflicted by the judgment. This rule has been long established and enforced -by courts of equity. Our statute, article 2875, Revised Statutes, declares, that' no injunction to stay execution upon any valid and subsisting judgment shall be granted after the expiration of one year from the rendition of the judgment, unless it be made to appear that an application for an injunction has been delayed in consequence of the fraud or false promises of the plaintiff in the judgment, practiced or made at the time of or after the rendition of such judgment; or unless for some equitable matter or defense arising after the rendition of such judgment. The question for our decision is, are the averments in appellant’s petition sufficient under the rules of law, as recited above, to entitle him to the relief sought by his suit; and upon the answer to this question depends the correctness or incorrectness of the judgment appealed from. In considering a motion to dissolve and dismiss, the allegations of the petition must be taken and held to be true. That the appellant had a meritorious defense to the original suit, so far as the plaintiff in that suit sought to subject appellant’s homestead to the payment of the moneyed judgment recovered by plaintiff, we think there can be no question. The mortgagee had released the homestead from the operation of the mortgage before he- assigned it,- and the release was duly recorded on the day of its execution. Was appellant’s application for injunction within the time prescribed by article 2875, Revised Statutes? The petition charges that both the plaintiff and defendant, Silliman, at and before the rendition of the judgment foreclosing the mortgage lien upon appellant’s homestead, had actual knowledge, and constructive notice as well, that the homestead had been and was released from the operation of the mortgage executed by appellant to the plaintiff’s intestate, and that they, the said plaintiff and the said Silliman, knew well that defendant was ignorant of any purpose on their part to take a foreclosure upon his homestead, and that they knew that he would interpose a defense if he had known of their purpose to subject to the payment of the debt due the plaintiff’s intestate the homestead of appellant. These averments, in our judgment, meet the requirements of the statute, and demonstrate that the appellant’s application for an injunction was delayed in consequence of the fraud practiced by plaintiff on defendant at the rendition of the judgment. By these averments the judgment of foreclosure was manifestly obtained by the fraud of the parties in concealing from the court the fact that a portion of the lands covered by the mortgage, which was occupied and claimed by defendant as his homestead, had been released by the mortgagee. We therefore hold that the second ground set out in the motion to dissolve the injunction and dismiss this suit is not good, and could not be a basis of the judgment sought by the motion. This brings us to the consideration of the only other ground for the motion, which we deem it necessary to notice, to-wit, that appellant’s defense to plaintiff’s suit being known to appellant at the time of citation upon him, he was guilty of such gross neglect in not prosecuting his defense within the time prescribed by law as should deny him the remedy sought by his petition. This point is the only one of any difficulty presented by the record. The rule, that he who seeks relief from equity from the effects of a judgment rendered against him after personal service, must show that he was not guilty of culpable neglect in not making defense to the suit before judgment, is simple and easily understood, but its application is often attended with difficulty. In our examination of authorities cited by counsel for appellee, we find no case entirely analogous to the one under consideration. The case of Wicke v. Lake, 27 Wisconsin, 410, is more analogous in its salient points to this case than any we have found. In this Wisconsin case the appellee, Lake, was made a party defendant to a suit for the foreclosure of a mortgage. Lake was owner by title paramount to that of the mortgagee of a portion of the land mortgaged. When cited tó answer the plaintiff’s suit, he consulted with his codefendants, and was informed by them that they had a complete defense to the suit in the opinion of their counsel; and he then consulted counsel of ability and experience, who, after examining the defense made to the suit by his codefendants, assured Lake that the defense was a complete one to the recovery by the plaintiff. Belying upon this advice, Lake failed to answer the suit, and judgment was taken against him by default, and the plaintiff recovered against the other defendants, obtained a decree foreclosing the mortgage upon all of the lands covered by the mortgage, including that portion to which Lake had title; and his excuse for not defending the suit was held sufficient, upon his application to have the judgment set aside as to him and to allow him to answer. In the lower court the excuse set up by Lake was held insufficient, but upon appeal to the Supreme Court the judgment of the lower court was reversed and the cause remanded, with order that the judgment by default be set aside and that appellant be allowed to make his defense. Delivered November 3, 1892. In this case it is shown by averments in the appellant’s petition, that Williams, to whom he executed the mortgage, was an attorney and counselor at law, and was at the time of the execution of the mortgage, and so continued until his death, appellant’s attorney and confidential adviser, and that Williams assured him when he executed the release that his homestead could never be held liable for the mortgage debt, and that he need give himself no uneasiness about the exemption of his homestead from the operation of the mortgage. The appellant further avers in- his petition that he believed at the time of the execution of the release that it was written on the same paper as that containing the mortgage, and that he still believed this until after the judgment and a short time before the institution of this suit, when the release was found in the clerk’s office in which it was recorded; and that believing this, coupled with the assurance of the mortgagee that his homestead could never be subjected to the operation of the mortgage, he thought it unnecessary to make any defense against the suit for foreclosure of the mortgage. And another fact which seems to have lulled him into security is, that the citation did not describe the land further than as three tracts, and the mortgage he knew to be upon three tracts, one of which was the 640 acres upon which was his homestead. In view of all the facts, we are unable to say that the petition did not show-sufficient excuse for appellant’s failure to defend the suit and show that his homestead was released from the operation of the mortgage; and we therefore think that the court erred in sustaining the appellee’s motion to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the suit. The judgment of the lower court will be reversed and the cause remanded for another trial. Reversed and remanded. Justice Williams did not sit in this case.","Wilson Lumpkin v. L. E. Williams, Administrator. No. 14. 1. Injunction — Case in Judgment. — The petition alleged this case: Judgment by default April 23, 1889, against appellant on a note and foreclosing a mortgage upon three tracts of land, upon one of which was his homestead. The note had been given by him to W., who was his attorney and confidential •adviser and so remained until his death, to secure fees due W. The mortgage was not intended to include the homestead. Shortly after it was given he called IV.""s attention to the mistake and asked him to correct it, which he promptly did by releasing the homestead, and the release was recorded. Appellant thought the release was written on the back of the mortgage and had remained in the hands of W.. who assured him that his homestead could never be subjected to the lien of said mortgage under any circumstances. Appellant never saw the release; it was not called to the attention of the court when the judgment foreclosing the mortgage was taken. Suit was by the executor of W. Believing the mortgage not in any way to affect his homestead, appellant did not answer, and he would have defended had he known or suspected an intention to foreclose upon his homestead. That he did not know that it had been done until three months before the institution of this suit. Injunction was prayed for to restrain foreclosure sale. Held, that a cause of action is shown, and dismissal of the case upon demurrer was erroneous. 2. Fraud. — According to these averments the judgment of foreclosure was manifestly obtained by the fraud of the parties in concealing from the court the fact that a portion of the lands covered by the mortgage was occupied by defendant as his homestead and had been released by the mortgagee. 3. A Known Defense as Ground for Injunction. — The rule that he who seeks relief in equity from the effects of a judgment rendered against him on personal service, must show thatjie was not guilty of culpable neglect in not making his defense to the suit, is simple and easily understood, but its application is often attended with difficulty. The facts in this case reviewed, and held to show a case entitling appellant to equitable relief. 4. Injunction After one Year. — Revised Statutes, article 2875, forbids injunction to stay execution after one year from the rendition of the judgment, unless the application was delayed in consequence of the fraud or false promises of the plaintiff, etc. The petition (which it is alleged was filed within three months after the discovery of the foreclosure on the homestead) avers that the plaintiff in the foreclosure suit had actual notice that the homestead had been released from the operation of the mortgage, and knew that the petitioner was ignorant of his intention to foreclose upon it, and knew that petitioner would have defended the suit had such purpose been known to him. These and the other averments in the petition excuse the delay in asking for the injunction. Appeal from Anderson. Tried below before Hon. F. A. Williams. J. R. Burnett, for appellant. The facts alleged in appellant’s petition are sufficient to entitle him to a new trial or to a reformation of the judgment of foreclosure so as to release his homestead from said judgment. Freeman v.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. This is a prohibition suit, brought in the District Court of Comal County, wherein an original proceeding to annul a judgment rendered by the Justice Court was prohibited on the ground of want of jurisdiction of the Justice Court to grant such relief. The justice of the peace before whom the proceedings were pending and the plaintiff in the proceeding to annul the judgment of the Justice Court were defendants. They answered by general and special exceptions to the sufficiency of the petition, and by plea to the jurisdiction of the District Court to grant the extraordinary writ of prohibition, and by general denial. On a final hearing, the writ of prohibition was perpetuated, and the respondents have appealed therefrom to this court. The only question that we decide is, had the District Court, in 1888, jurisdiction to grant and perpetuate a writ of prohibition against proceedings about to be had in a Justice Court ? Prohibition acts directly upon the court, and is a common law writ that lies only when the matter to be prohibited is judicial in nature. It is preventive in character, and is ordinarily at common law used to prevent a court of inferior powers from usurping its jurisdiction in some judicial matter. It is issued by a court of superior jurisdiction to one that is inferior. This necessarily requires an investigation into the jurisdiction of the court that issues the writ and of that against which it is directed, in order to determine if it will lie. If the court against which the writ is directed is free and independent of any supervisory control of the tribunal of superior jurisdiction, and is within the limits of its jurisdiction general in the sense that it has the power to hear and determine the subjects of its jurisdiction in its own way, then the writ would not lie, unless the law that created the superior tribunal conferred upon it the power to issue the writ. Every court within this State jurisdiction that has the power to hear and determine judicial controversies is general in its jurisdiction over the subjects that they have cognizance of by the law of their creation; but all such courts are also of special jurisdiction, in the sense that they can not hear and determine subjects of controversy that are not embraced in the written law that creates and defines their powers. To the written law alone they look to ascertain when they have the power to hear and determine, and when this jurisdiction is prescribed it is restrictive of all other. With us these principles of law apply as well to Justice Courts as they do to the District Courts. There is no inherent power in the District Court, by virtue of its law and equity jurisdiction, to issue all writs that were known to common law and equity practice. For if such was the rule, it would permit the court to exercise a jurisdiction to meet the exigencies of each case, and would relieve it from the application of the principle, well settled with us, that it can not exceed the power conferred by the law that created it, and that the enumeration of these powers excludes the right to exercise others. The present Constitution, as it existed when the writ of prohibition in this cause was issued and perpetuated, in conferring jurisdiction upon the District Courts, among other things, says: “ Said courts and the judges thereof shall have power to issue writs of habeas corpus in felony cases, mandamus, injunction, certiorari, and all writs necessary to enforce their jurisdiction.” The acts of the Legislature on the subject of the jurisdiction of the District Courts in this respect follow the Constitution. Neither by the Constitution nor by legislation thereunder is a supervisory control and jurisdiction given to the District Courts over Justice Courts or other inferior tribunals, as was given by the Constitution of 1845 and that of 1869. The provisions of the Constitution quoted is all that has any bearing upon the question before us. It is apparent that the omission from the present Constitution of that provision of the Constitution of 1845 and 1869 that conferred upon the •District Court a supervisory control and jurisdiction over inferior courts, is equivalent to a legislative declaration that such jurisdiction shall not exist. Delivered November 23, 1892. It is further apparent, that the writ issued in this case was not in furtherance of the jurisdiction of the District Court as necessary to the enforcement of its jurisdiction, as the judicial matter sought to be prohibited was pending in another tribunal of equal dignity with that of the District Court, in so far as its jurisdiction extended over subjects of which it had cognizance. If the provision of the Constitution in question had included prohibition, as it did injunction and other named writs, it would have been within the jurisdiction of the District Court to have issued such writs in all cases that were permitted under the principles and usages of common law and equity practice, as is illustrated by the construction of the law in question in the case of County of Anderson v. Kennedy, 58 Texas, 621. We find no provision in the law that conferred upon the District Court the power to issue the writ of prohibition. Such being the case, we .reverse the judgment of the court below, with instructions to dismiss the case. Reversed and dismissed.","Herman Seele et al. v. The State, ex rel. B. Roether. No. 39. 1. Jurisdiction of District Court. — The clause in the Constitution of the State (article 5, section 8) prescribing that “said courts (District Courts) and the judges thereof shall have power to issue writs of habeas corpus in felony cases, mandamus, injunction, certiorari, and all writs necessary to enforce their jurisdiction,” and the legislation on the subject, do not confer upon said courts a supervisory control over Justice Courts, as was given by the Constitution of 1845 and that of 1869. 2.

The justice of the peace, Hermann Seele, had no jurisdiction of cause No. 150, the object of which was to annul or set aside a valid judgment, rendered before his predecessor, which became final more than five months before proceedings were instituted for that purpose, for the following reasons: 1. A Justice Court is a court of law and not of equity, having only such powers and jurisdiction as is given it by statute. Const., art. 5, sec. 19; Rev. Stats., arts. 1539, 1545; Cowan v. Nixon, 28 Texas, 230. 2.

Stats., arts. 1122, 1169, 1170; 22 Texas, 8; Murph. on Justice Peace, secs. 80, 82, 93, 225, 226; Goss v. McClaren, 17 Texas, 115, 116; Blum v. Wettermark, 58 Texas, 127. 3. The law has given the justices of the peace the power to grant new trials in their courts, by motion made within ten days, and when this is done no bill of review can be introduced in that court. Rev. Stats., arts. 1621, 1622, 1638; 2 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 573. 4. A judgment in a trial court becomes absolutely a vested right in the owner thereof after the court adjourns, and nothing less than a bill in equity showing no negligence or laches, together with an accident beyond his control, will give even a court of equity, such as the District Court, the right to interfere with such judgment. 5. Equity will in no case lend its aid, even in the District Court, when a party through neglect failed to prosecute a certiorari; and the petition and evidence in this case show this fact beyond controversy.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. The verdict of the jury, which is supported by the evidence, establishes that on the 23d day of November, 1889, appellant negligently set fire to the dry grass and weeds which it ■allowed to accumulate upon its right of way; and this fire spread to the farm of appellee adjoining, and burned over about 80 acres of his pasture, destroying 300 of his rails, 25 posts, 306 fruit trees, 60 grapevines, and 200 blackberry vines, the cash value of all of which amounted to as much or more than the verdict of the jury. Appellee brought this suit for the damage so caused to him, and recovered judgment for the sum of $609.17, from which this appeal is taken. No complaint is made as to the amount of the verdict, or the sufficiency of the evidence to show negligence on the part of appellant. Appellant complains that the measure of damage applied by the court below for the destruction of the growing fruit trees and vines was their cash value, when they should have been treated as a part of the land, and its lessened value the proper measure. A number of decisions in such cases recognize as correct the rule adopted by the court below. Whitbeck v. Railway, 36 Barb., 644; Railway v. Bohannon, 7 S. E. Rep., 236; Montgomery v. Locke, 72 Cal., 75. Other authorities, however, perhaps with better reason, adopt the rule contended for by appellant. 3 Sedg. on Dam., 933, 934. This rule, however, is generally adopted for the benefit of the owner of the land, and not for the one causing the injury, upon the manifestly just ground that by the destruction of a valuable fruit, ornamental, or shade tree, the value of the land may be lessened in an amount many times the value of the tree itself, and in such case the rule adopted by the court below would not furnish adequate compensation. We believe where the thing injured or destroyed is a part of the realty, the lessened value of the land will come nearer furnishing a just rule in its application to all cases than the one adopted by the court (Express Company v. Real Estate Association, 81 Texas, 81), but we do not believe appellant is in a position to complain that a different rule was applied to it in this case. If appellee is willing to accept the cash value of Ms trees and waive the incidental damage, if any, done by their destructian to his farm, it would seem that appellant should be satisfied. None of the evidence introduced tends in the least to show that the land was not damaged to the extent of the full value of the trees, whatever that might be. One of the methods of proving the damage to the land is by proving the value of the trees taken therefrom. Kolb v. Bankhead, 18 Texas, 228. And where the trees are full grown, and are valuable only as timber, their value, less the cost of marketing them, has been frequently recognized as the proper measure of the actual damage to be allowed for their wrongful or negligent destruction. 3 Sedg. on Dam., 933. Appellant also complains at the action of the court in giving to the jury, at the request of appellee’s counsel, the following definition of negligence, viz.: “Negligence is the lack of that care which an ordinarily prudent man would exercise in the management of his own affairs.’ ’ The following definition was approved by our Supreme Court in Railway v. Oram, 49 Texas, 346, viz.: “ Ordinary care and caution is such as a prudent man would exercise under similar circumstances.” The definition-to which we are cited by appellant is found in the opinion in Cotton Press Company v. Bradley, 52 Texas, 599, as follows: “Negligence implies generally the want of that care and diligence which ordinarily prudent men would use to prevent injury under the circumstances of the particular case.” We believe the difference in these definitions is so slight that no injury could have resulted to appellant under the evidence in this case. No complaint is made against the finding of the jury on the question of negligence, nor is it contended that their verdict could have been different had this charge not been given. The court committed no reversible error in calling the attention of the jury in the charge to the values of the several items as alleged in the petition. We think the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 17, 1893. Justice Stephens did not sit in this case.","Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. O. H. Gorman. No. 70. 1. Damages—Measure of, for Negligently Destroying Trees.—In an action against a railway company for negligently causing a fire which destroyed plaintiff’s fruit trees and vines, the defendant will not be heard to complain that the measure of damages applied by the court was their cash value, instead of the lessened value of the land, since plaintiff may waive the incidental and additional damage to his land caused by the destruction of the trees. 2. Negligence—Definitions.—The court charged that “ negligence is the lack of that care which an ordinarily prudent man would exercise in the management of his own affairs.’’ Appellant contends that the definition should have been as follows: “Negligence implies generally the want of that care and diligence which ordinarily prudent men would use to prevent injury under the circumstances of the particular case.” Held, that the difference in these definitions is so slight that under the facts in this case no injury could have resulted to appellant in this respect.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Action of trespass to try title by appellant against appellees, to recover a tract of 540 acres of land, part of the Daniel Reel league. Appellees pleaded various defenses, but one of which need be stated. That was a plea setting up as a bar to this action a former judgment of the District Court of' Rusk County. Appellant in reply to this plea asserted that the judgment was void, for the reasons hereinafter considered. The parties to that judgment were not made parties to this suit, and there was no prayer for reviewing or setting it aside. The case was tried by the court without a jury, and a judgment rendered for the appellees, on the ground that the former judgment precluded appellant from recovering. There is no statement of facts, but the findings of law and fact of the district judge are in the record, and the question for determination here is, whether or not the conclusion of law that such former judgment was not void, but bound plaintiff, was correct. In order to reverse that ruling, it must affirmatively appear to be wrong-from the facts found, for we are without any other means of reviewing it. The material facts thus found are: That plaintiff, prior to that judgment, had title to an undivided interest in the land sued for; that in 1875, there was pending in the District Court of Rusk County a suit in which Berry and others were plaintiffs and Ilarnage and others defendants, which involved what is called the west quarter of the Reel league. In that suit, in 1875, two separate pleas of intervention were filed, one by the Flanagans and one by the Iveys. Among the latter were the appellant and his brothers, who were joint owners with him. Appellant at that time was a minor, but several of his brothers who intervened with him were adults, and had employed attorneys to represent them in the intervention. The minutes of the court recite that the intervenors appeared, and that S. R. Whitley was appointed guardian ad litem for plaintiff, and that lie qualified by giving the bond fixed by the court and taking oath as required by law. It appears by the two interventions that the north quarter of the Reel league, of which the land in controversy is a part, was introduced into the-litigation in that suit. A trial was had at the August Term, 1875, at. which all the parties, plaintiffs, defendants, and intervenors, including plaintiff represented by his guardian ad litem, appeared. A verdict was. rendered as to the matters in issue between the plaintiffs and defendants, and a judgment was rendered thereon settling the title to the west quarter of the league. An agreement was then presented to the court between the intervenors, settling their controversies as to the north quarter, and a judgment was entered in accordance therewith for partition of that pait of the league among the several claimants. Appellee was represented in this agreement and judgment by his guardian ad litem. After the judgment was rendered an execution for costs issued against the Iveys, and was levied on all their interest in the Reel league. At the sale, N. G-. Bagley, who was their attorney in that suit, bought in the land for $10. It was worth $500 or $600. It does not appear that any of the defendants are claiming under that sale, Bagley’s representatives not being made parties. It is claimed by appellant that the judgment was void because he was not legally a party to the suit. The law then in force provided for the appointment of a special guardian to take care of the interests of a minor in a suit pending or about to be commenced, to which such minor was a proper party, such appointment to be made by the court in which the suit was pending or about to be commenced. Pasch. Dig., arts. 6969, 6970. Before that statute was passed, and since its repeal, minors could sue by next friend, and there is nothing in those provisions which would prevent a suit or an intervention being brought before the court in that manner. The brothers of appellant brought him into court by the plea of intervention, and in the absence of the record showing to the contrary it would be presumed, if necessary to support the action of the court, that in so doing they acted in the capacity of next friend. The fact that the proceeding was an intervention could not affect the question, for intervenors may occupy the position of either plaintiffs or defendants, and all the elements of a cause of action or ground of defense may be contained in such pleading. Parties may come into court by that method as effectually as by original suit. When they were introduced into the suit it was proper for the court to appoint guardians for them. Bond v. Dillard, 50 Texas, 309. We must conclude therefore that the plaintiff was before the court in the case of Berry v. Harnage in such a manner as to give that court jurisdiction over his person. Martin v. Weyman, 26 Texas, 468. The fact that the judgment was rendered on the agreement of the guardian does not render it void. The guardian acted under the supervision of the court, and, in a collateral proceeding, it must be presumed that the court ascertained the facts upon which the agreement was based and al lowed no wrong done to the minor. It might be erroneous for a court to base its judgment upon an agreement of the guardian, but this would not render its action void. It is the judgment which binds, and not the agreement. Ilollis v. Dasliiell, 52 Texas, 187. If, by the interventions in the ease of Berry v. Harnage, other land was improperly introduced as the subject of the. controversy, the action of the court in allowing it might be irregular, but its jurisdiction would not be affected. A state of facts might be supposed"" in which it would have been proper to bring all of the land in, in order to adjust controversies and rights which extended through all of it. Whether such a case was made by the pleadings or not, parties were before the court seeking to litigate over a subject of which it had jurisdiction, and its judgment entertaining and determining their suit can not be collaterally attacked. The judgment as between the intervenors is found by the court below to be a part of the final judgment settling the controversy of the plaintiffs and defendants, and there is no merit in appellant’s contention that it is a separate decree. This can not be treated as a direct proceeding to set aside the judgment. The allegations and prayer of the petition show no such object, and none of the parties to that judgment are before the court. The same may be said as to the execution sale to Bagley. His representatives are not made parties, and it is not made to appear that any of the defendants hold under that sale. Neither the pleadings nor the findings of the judge show that the proper parties are before the court to enable us to pass upon the validity of that sale. Delivered November 3, 1892. The court below was right in treating the suit simply as an action of trespass to try title, and not one to review and set aside the judgment and the sale to Bagley, and its judgment should be affirmed. Affirmed.","B. F. Ivey v. J. W. Harrell et al. No. 18. 1. Practice in Appellate Court. — When there is no statement of facts, but the conclusions of fact and law of the district judge are found in the record, in order to reverse the judgment it must affirmatively appear to be wrong, from the facts found by the judge. 2. Res Adjudicaba. — In 1875 a suit was pending in Rusk County, styled Berry et al. v. Harnage et al., which involved the west quarter of the Reel league, in which league appellant, a minor, at that time had an undivided interest. Two separate pleas of intervention were filed in that suit; one by the Flanagans and the other by the Iveys; the latter being the appellant (represented by a guardian ad litem) and his brothers, adults. By these interventions the north quarter of the league, in which appellant had an interest, was introduced into the litigation, and the trial (at which all the parties were represented) resulted in a judgment settling the title of the west quarter, and a further judgment upon an agreement between the interveners settling their rights in the north quarter and partitioning it between them. Held, the court had jurisdiction of the person of appellant and the subject matter, and the judgment therein was binding on him and a bar to this action, which was for a part of the land partitioned. 3. Special Guardian — Next Friend. — The law in force in 1875 provided for the appointment of a special guardian to take care of the interests of a minor in a suit pending or about to be commenced. Pasch. Dig., arts. 6969, 6970. Before that statute was passed, and since its repeal, minors could sue by next friend, and there is nothing in those provisions which would prevent a suit or an intervention being brought before the court in that manner. The brothers of the appellant brought him in by their plea of intervention, and if necessary, in the absence of record evidence to the contrary, it would be presumed that in doing so they acted in the capacity of next friend. 4. Agreement of Guardian. — The fact that the judgment was rendered upon the agreement of the guardian does not render it void. The guardian acted under the supervision of the court, and in a collateral proceeding it must be presumed that the court ascertained the facts upon which the agreement was based, and allowed no wrong done to the minor. 5. Intervenors may occupy the positions of either plaintiffs or defendants, and all the elements of a cause of action or ground of defense may be contained in their pleading, and parties may come into court as effectually by that method as by original suit. 6. Collateral Attack. — If by the intervention other land was improperly made a subject of controversy, the action of the court in allowing it might be irregular, but its jurisdiction would not be affected. Whether such a state of facts was shown as to make it proper to bring all the land in or not, the parties were before the court, seeking to litigate over a subject of which it had jurisdiction, and its judgment entertaining and determining their suit can not be collaterally attacked 7. Final Judgment. — The court below has found that the judgment rendered in Berry v. Harnage, as between the intervenors, was a part of the final judgment, and there is no merit in appellant's contention that it was a separate decree. 8. Direct Proceeding to Set Aside Judgment. — After the partition judgment was rendered an execution for costs was issued against the Iveys, under which the interest of appellant in the league was sold and one Bagley became the purchaser. He is not a party to this suit, nor do any of the defendants claim under him. None of the parties to the suit of Berry v. Harnage are parties to this, wherefore this case can not be considered a direct proceeding to set aside that judgment, but was correctly treated by the court below as an ordinary action of trespass to try title. Appeal from Rusk. Tried below before Hon. A. J. Booty. The opinion states the case. Pleading of the defendants alleges that they own their several parts of the land sued for by purchase from those to whom it was allotted in the partition judgment in Beny v. Harnage. W. B. Morris and J. R. Arnold, for appellant. 1. The court erred in admitting in evidence that part of the judgment in Berry v. Harnage entered by agreement. Because: (1) The subject matter and every right of all parties was settled by that part of the decree founded on the verdict of the jury (2) The decree on the verdict ended the power of the court and of the guardian ad litem over said minors and their property. (3) The rights of the minors are specially preserved from any prejudice by said decree. (4) Intervenors can not claim or litigate matters not already involved in suit. (5) The final judgment on the verdict left nothing for intervenors to partition, (6) There can be no judgment after a final judgment. Rev. Stats., art. 1337; Wooton v.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This case has twice been before the . Supreme Court prior to this appeal. 73 Texas, 324; 79 Texas, 642. The killing of the child by the servants of appellant occurred in July, 1886, and in order to fix the liability upon the company, it was necessary for the plaintiff to show that the death was caused by gross negligence of such, servants. At the last trial the court’s charge contained the following instruction, which is assigned as error: “ But if you find that the deceased was not far enough from the track to be out of danger, and they, the servants of defendant company, could by the exercise of unusual care have stopped the engine in time to have prevented the accident, if any, but negligently ran on, then you will find for the plaintiff; and if you find that the deceased went back on the track, but that the servants of the defendant company could by the exercise of extraordinary diligence have stopped the engine and cars, but did not, you will find for plaintiff.” This instruction misstated the law. Even in ordinary cases, where less than gross negligence would make the defendant liable, only ordinary care, and not “ unusual” care or “ extraordinary diligence,” would be required. Here it was necessary that gross negligence be shown, and the court so charged, but in applying the law to the facts, gave the instruction above quoted. "" # This will necessitate a reversal of the case, as the evidence was such as to require that the question whether or not the child was killed through the gross negligence of appellants servants be left to the jury. In the opinion delivered by the Supreme Court on the first appeal (73 Texas, 324), it was said: “Even if the servants saw the danger, the company was only responsible for their gross negligence. However, the question of negligence and of its degree usually depends upon the particular facts of each case, and a state of facts which would show ordinary negligence in case of the injury of a person who had arrived at years of discretion, might in case of a child establish gross negligence. The case must always be proportioned to the danger, and in cases like this, the danger to a child is obviously greater than it would be to an adult.” These remarks are obviously just and applicable to the facts of the case, but they were not intended to be given in charge to the jury. The degree of care which the servants were required to use, so far as liability of appellant depended on it, was such as would exempt them from the charge of gross negligence, and whether or not that degree of care was used in this case was a question that should have been left to the jury. What particular acts or facts would constitute gross negligence should not be stated in the charge. The care should be proportioned to the danger, and the question whether or not there was gross negligence in the conduct of the servants operating the train should be determined with reference to all of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence. And if the circumstances, considered with reference to the dangers of the sitúatian, showed the exercise of so slight a degree of care as evinced a disregard of or indifference to the safety of the child, and if the death of the child was caused thereby, then, and not otherwise, defendant would be liable. It was proper for the court to explain to the jury what constitutes negligence in general, in order to make them to understand the difference which the law has undertaken to make between ordinary negligence and gross negligence. The court did not err in refusing to instruct a verdict for defendant. The question of its liability should be submitted to the jury, to depend upon proof by appellee that the death was caused by the gross negligence of appellant’s servants. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 23, 1893.","Sabine & East Texas Railway Company v. William Hanks. No. 72. 1. Erroneous Charge when Gross Negligence had to be Proved. The killing of the child, for which the suit was instituted, having occurred in 1880, when in order to fix liability gross negligence had to be- proved, a charge which required the servants of the company to exercise “unusual care” and “ extraordinary diligence” was erroneous. 2. Same.—What particular facts would constitute gross negligence should not be stated in the charge, but determined by the jury, with reference to all of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence; and if they showed so slight a degree of care as evidenced a disregard of or indifference to the safety of the child, and if the death of the child was caused thereby, then, and not otherwise, defendant would be liable. 3.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. The land in controversy is in one tract, patented to Robert Hill on the 24th day of September, 1853, on his headriglit certificate, and is situated about thirteen miles a little northwest from Clarksville, in Red River County. There is also another survey of 800 acres, patented on the same day by virtue of the same certificate, known as the Robert Hill survey, and situated about ten miles northwest from Clarksville. Pecan Bayou runs through the last named tract, and the land in controversy is about one mile from said bayou. On the 12th day of February, 1853, the then sheriff of Red River County, under an execution issued out of the Justice Court for precinct number 4, sold to James C. Brown and William A. Park a tract of land which is described in the deed as follows: “A certain tract or parcel of land consisting of 640 acres, more or less, as the property of Robert Hill, .situated as follows: On the waters of Pecan Bayou, about eight miles northwest from Clarksville, surveyed on the headright certificate of Robert Hill.” The court below found that the judgment and execution recited in the deed were duly rendered and issued, the records of said precinct having been destroyed by fire, and the justice and sheriff being both dead. The suit in the court below was by appellees as heirs of Robert Hill, as plaintiffs, against appellant, who claims under the sheriff’s deed, as defendant. The court below held the sheriff’s deed insufficient to pass title to this land, and rendered judgment in favor of appellees, from which this appeal is prosecuted. It does not appear from the statement of facts that the land has ever been in the actual possession of any one, nor was any evidence introduced to show any assertion of claim on the part of appellant or his vendors to this particular tract of land under the sheriff’s deed about the time of its execution, nor that they had ever paid taxes thereon; nor is there any evidence in the record that the patentee, Hill, or those claiming under him, ever recognized this sale. From the brief of appellant, it would seem that the court below rendered judgment in favor of appellees upon the ground that the description of the land in the sheriff’s deed was, upon its face, insufficient to pass title, and was therefore void; but from a careful examination of the record, we do not understand the conclusions of the court to be based entirely upon this ground. It seems that the deed was admitted in evidence, and paroi evidence was allowed to aid in identifying the land conveyed. The evidence offered, however, went only to the extent of showing that there were two surveys in that county patented upon the same-certificate; that one of these surveys contains 640 acres, the amount called for in the sheriff’s deed, and was about thirteen miles instead of eight miles northwest from Clarksville, and was about one mile from Pecan Bayou; while the other survey contained 800 acres, and was about"" ten miles instead of eight miles northwest from Clarksville, and Pecan Bayou,, called for in the deed, runs through it. As shown in the conclusions of fact, no attempt was made to show that the land in controversy was in fact surveyed at the time of the execution of the sheriff’s deed, nor that there had been an assertion of claim to this land under such deed dating back to about the time of its execution. No-attempt was made to account for the failure to introduce the surveyor’s records to show that this particular land had in fact been surveyed at the time of the levy, so as to authorize the court to presume such to have-been the case, as required by repeated decisions in this State. Ruby v. Von Valkenberg, 72 Texas, 459; Tucker v. Murphy, 66 Texas, 360. We believe if appellant claimed that the land patented September 24, 1853, was the land which was conveyed by the sheriff’s deed in February, 1853, it was incumbent upon him to show that at the time of the levy of the execution this land had been located, so as to show that the defendant in execution had at that time such title as was subject to levy and sale; and that this evidence was also material to aid in identifying-the land in controversy as being that referred to in the deed; and as the-necessary evidence was not offered to authorize the court to supply this-omission by presumption, there was no error in holding that the evidence was not sufficient to show that the land in controversy passed by the sheriff’s deed. It has several times been held, that limitation will run only from the date of the patent, unless the date of the location affirmatively appears-from the record; and where it is attempted to hold under a sheriff’s deed land which was sold for the insignificant price of 2-J cents per acre, the-consideration recited in this deed, we think the court would hardly be authorized to hold, in the absence of evidence, that land patented in September had been located in the February preceding, in order to sustain such sale. Wood v. Welder, 42 Texas, 396. Finding no error in the judgment rendered by the court below, let it be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 16, 1893.","J. B. Watkins v. T. D. Hill et al. No. 423. 1. Deed by Sheriff — Description of Land — Parol Evidence of Identity.—A sheriff's deed described the land conveyed as “ a certain tract or parcel of land consisting of G40 acres, more or less, as the property of Robert Hill, situated as follows: On the waters of Pecan Bayou, about eight miles northwest from Clarksville, surveyed on the headright certificate of Robert Hill.'' Parol evidence admitted to aid this description showed only that there were two surveys in the same county, located by virtue of the'same certificate; one of 800 acres, situated ten miles northwest from Clarksville, and the other of 640 acres, thirteen miles nearly northwest from Clarksville. There was no proof of the surveyor's records identifying the tract of 640 acres in controversy, or showing that the survey had. in fact, been made prior to the date of the sheriff’s levy, nor was any attempt made to account for the nonproduction of these records; nor did it appear that the tract in suit had ever been in the actual possession of any one, or that claim of title had been made thereto under the sheriff’s deed from about the time of its date. Held, that the evidence was insufficient to show that the land in controversy passed by the sheriff’s deed. 2. Trespass to Try Title — Proof of Date of Survey Requisite, When.—Where, in trespass to try title, one party claims the land under a sheriff’s deed made prior to the date of the patent, it is incumbent on him to show that at the time of the levy of the execution the land had been located, so as to show that the defendant in execution had at that time such title as was subject to levy and sale.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This suit was brought to enjoin the collection of a school tax levied in Stonewall County. There was a trial •before the court below without a j ury, upon an agreed statement of facts. The assignments of error raise questions of law only. In August, 1887, while Stonewall County was an unorganized county and attached to Jones County for judicial purposes, an election was held in the territory covered by Stonewall County, by which a school tax of 12£ cents on the §100 worth of property was voted, in pursuance of the orders of the Commissioners Court of Jones County, declaring said entire territory to be one school district, and providing for an election therein to determine whether said tax should be levied. The election was duly held, the result declared, and the tax levied by the Commissioners Court of Jones County. Thereafter, on the 28tli day of December, 1888, Stonewall County was duly organized, and in February following the Commissioners Court of the newly organized county created two school districts out of its territory, and defined their limits and boundaries, without first obtaining the will of the majority of the voters of said districts. In March, 1889, said Commissioners Court ordered an election in school district number 1, at which a tax of 20 cents on the 8100 worth of property was voted; whereupon the Commissioners Court declared the result of the election, and levied the tax which appellant by this suit sought to enjoin. This election was ordered upon the petition of more than twenty qualified property holding tax paying voters of said district; but the names of less than twenty of them, to-wit, nineteen only, appeared upon the last assessment roll of the county. 1. The first contention of appellant is, that the court erred in holding that Jones County had no authority to create the unorganized county of Stonewall a school district and order an election therein for the purpose of voting a school tax. The Constitution, article 7, section 3, authorizes the Legislature to provide for the formation of school districts within all or any of the counties of this State. In pursuance of the provision of the Constitution, article 3731 of the Revised Statutes makes it the duty of the County Commissioners Court of all counties not exempted from that section of the Revised Statutes to subdivide their respective counties into convenient school districts. Article 9, section 1, of the Constitution, provides, that territory exterior to existing counties may be divided into counties in advance of population, and attached for judicial and land surveying purposes to the most convenient organized county or counties. Section 12 of this article provides, that lands lying in and owned by nonresidents of unorganized counties shall be assessed and taxes thereon collected at the office of the Comptroller. Stonewall County never was any part of the territory of Jones County. Our conclusion is, that the Commissioners Court of Jones County had no authority under the Constitution and-laws of this State to declare the unorganized county of Stonewall a school district, and that the proceedings which resulted in the levy of the 12-J- cents school tax by the commissioners of Jones County were void. Appellant’s second contention, that there was error in holding that the organization of Stonewall County made void the election previously held under the order of the Commissioners Court of Jones County, is therefore rendered immaterial, and must be denied. 2. The issue raised by the third assignment of error is, that though the petition for the election ordered by the Commissioners Court of Stonewall County may have been signed by twenty or more qualified property holding tax paying voters residing in the district, the election was nevertheless void, because less than twenty of these names were shown by the last assessment roll of the county. Article 3733 of the Revised Statutes, which provides for ordering such an election upon the petition of twenty or more qualified property holding tax paying voters, does not require that their names should appear upon the assessment rolls. Article 3733b, however, which states the qualification of the voters at the election and not of the petitioners for the election, declares, that all persons who are legally qualified voters of the State and county of their residence, and who are resident property tax payers in said district, as shown by the last assessment roll of the county, shall be entitled to vote, etc. The Constitution, article 7, section 3, prescribes the same qualifications, without the phrase “ as shown by the last assessment roll of the county.” This phrase is also omitted in the next succeeding article of the statute, which prescribes the proof to be made of the requisite qualification by a party whose vote has been challenged. We conclude, that the statute has not made the assessment roll the exclusive evidence of the qualification of the petitioners, and that the petition in this case was a sufficient predicate for ordering the election. 3. The fourth assignment reads as follows: “ The court erred in his finding of law, wherein he finds that the levy of school taxes in precinct number 1 is valid.” Several propositions are submitted under this assignment, all of which are disposed of by the preceding conclusions. It is therefore not necessary that we should decline to consider these propositions on account of the very general character of the assignment. 4. The fifth and last assignment asserts the invalidity of the tax, be- , ■cause the assessor failed to provide a separate tax roll for said school district, as required in article 3733h, but entered the same on the margin of the general State and county rolls. The authority relied on is the case of Folkerts v. Power, 42 Michigan, 283. That case arose under statutes materially different from our own. The school tax was required to be placed on the “city roll.” A separate tax warrant was required to be issued for the collection of the tax on the city roll, and the time of its collection differed from that of collecting taxes on the general State and county roll, upon which the school tax in that case was placed. Our statute, article 3733k, provides, that the tax assessor shall assess and the collector shall collect said district school taxes as other taxes. No tax warrant is required. While it is made the duty of the tax assessor to make a separate roll for each school district, we are of the opinion that the failure to provide such a roll is not fatal to the validity of the tax. We are of opinion that the action of the assessor in extending the school tax in a separate column upon the general State and county tax rolls, on the margin of which it was shown to what school district the tax belonged, though defective, was sufficient to warrant the collection of the tax. At all events, it is held in this State, that a court of equity will not on this ground alone enjoin the collection of the tax. Harrison v. Vines, 46 Texas, 15; George v. Dean, 47 Texas, 84. It follows from these' conclusions that the judgment must be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 23, 1893.","A. L. Rhomberg v. J. C. McLaren, Tax Collector. No. 99. 1. Unorganized County as a School District. — The unorganized county of S. was never any part of the territory of J. county; and the fact that it was attached to J. for judicial purposes, under section 1, article 9, of the Constitution. did not authorize the Commissioners Court of such latter county to declare such unorganized county a school district, and to order an election to determine the question of levying a special school tax therein. 2. School Tax—Petition for, by Tax Paying Voters of the District.—Article 3733 of the Revised Statutes, which provides that an election to determine the levy of a district school tax may be ordered upon the petition of twenty or more qualified property holding tax paying voters, does not require that their names should appear upon the assessment rolls, and does not make such rolls the exclusive evidence of the qualification of the petitioners. 3. School District Tax— Separate Assessment Rolls for.—Where the assessor, instead of providing a separate assessment roll therefor, extended a special school tax in a separate column upon the general State and county tax rolls, on the margin of which it was shown to what school district the tax belonged, held, that though defective, yet equity would not on this ground alone enjoin the collection of the tax. Appeal from Stonewall. Tried below before Hon. J. V. Cockrell. Dan. M. Jones and J. F. Cunningham, for appellant. 1. A school election for the school district composed of the unorganized county of Stonewall having been duly ordered, as authorized by the Constitution and laws, and having been duly held August 10, 1887, no other election for such purpose could thereafter be held until the expiration of two years from said date; and the fact of the organization of Stonewall County during such two years would make no difference.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On June 7, 1871, the will of M. J. Hall, Sr., was admitted to probate in the District Court of Harrison County, Texas. By this will it was provided that no action should be had in the courts in regard to the testator’s estate, except the probate and registration of his will and the return of an inventory, and also that the executors should not be required to give bond. M. J. Hall, Jr., and Samuel S. Mosely were named as executors. The petition to probate this will was in the name of M. J. Hall, Jr., only, but the order admitting the will to probate directed that letters issue to both executors. There is no evidence that either of the executors ever took an oath as such. M. J. Hall, Jr., however, filed a paper consisting of several pages, which upon its face would appear to have been a very full and complete inventory, were it not for the affidavit attached thereto, which is in the following language: “ The State of Texas, Harrison County. — Before me, C. E. Bolles, clerk of the District Court of Harrison County, appears M. J. Hall, Jr., who makes oath and says that the within inventory contains all the property and effects of the estate of M. J. Hall, Sr., which up to this time has come into his hands, but this inventory is not complete. “M. J. Hall, Jk. “ Sworn to and subscribed before me, this July 13, 1871. “C. E. Bolles, Clerk.” This paper was recorded as the inventory of said estate, and upon such record the said M. J. Hall, Jr., proceeded with the administration in all respects as the duly authorized independent executor of said will; and while so acting judgment was rendered against him as such executor in favor of Joseph Mason, on the 12th day of July, 1875, before J. K. Williams, a justice of the peace for Harrison County, and the land in controversy was regularly sold under an execution issued upon this judgment; and appellants claim under this sale. Appellee claims under quitclaim deeds made by the heirs of M. J. Hall, Sr., subsequent to the execution sale aforesaid. The land in controversy appeared regularly upon the inventory filed by the executor as above set forth. The court below construed the opinion rendered upon a former appeal of this case to hold, that to sustain the execution sale against the executor of M. J. Hall, Sr., it was necessary for the defendants claiming thereunder to prove that the executor qualified by taking the oath required of administrators and executors, and also returned a full and complete inventory of all property belonging to the estate. By an examination of this opinion, reported m 71 Texas, 14, it will be seen that the principal question presented upon that appeal was as to whether or not the taking of the oath and filing of an inventory by the executor could be proved by parol evidence, or should this be done by certified copies from the records; and it was held, that such copies would be the best evidence, and the court below erred in permitting parol evidence without showing that such copies could not be had. We do not find anything in this opinion which goes to the extent of holding that the taking of an oath by an independent executor would be essential to the validity of a sale made against him while acting as such; nor do we construe the opinion as holding that the return by him of a full inventory, or even any inventory, would be absolutely essential under all circumstances to the validity of such a sale, although there are expressions therein which might be given this construction. By the law in force at the time this will was admitted to probate it was provided, that “a testator may direct by his will that no action be had in the District Court in the administration of his estate except, first, to prove and record the will; second, to prove and record the will and return an inventory and appraisement of the estate; third, he may direct that the person named as his executor shall not be required to give bond.” Pasch. Dig., art. 5626. Also: “ When a will contains directions that no action be had in the District Court in the administration of the estate, except to prove and record the same, or to prove and record it and return an inventory and appraisement, no other provision of this act, except as disclosed in subdivision 4 of section 158, shall apply to such estate; but the same shall become like any other property to be administered under a power chargeable in the hands of a trustee, and liable to execution in any court having jurisdiction.” Pasch. Dig., art. 5628. The provisions in this act with reference to giving bonds and taking oaths by executors and administrators is found in Paschal’s Digest, article 5574,. as follows: “Where it is not otherwise provided, a bond shall be required to be given and an oath to be taken at a time specified in the order within twenty days.” We think that a fair construction of the different portions of this act leads to the conclusion, that it was not essential to the qualification of an independent executor, that any oath as such should be taken by him, and that his qualification would be complete upon the probate of the will and acceptance of the trust by him, with the return of an inventory and appraisement of the estate when this, was required by the law. We are aware that most of the cases in speaking of the acts of an independent executor mention the executor as having qualified as such, but we are not aware of any case which prescribes the requisites of such qualification to include the taking of an oath. In Mayes v. Blanton, 67 Texas, 247, it is said: “It appears that T. Schlutter died testate in the year 1877, and by liis will named three persons executors, two of whom renounced the executor-ship, and the other probated the will, and in accordance with its terms received letters testamentary which empowered him to administer the estate without the control of the Probate Court. The executor seems to have returned an inventory and appraisement.” It will be noticed that no allusion was made to the executor having taken an oath in this case, although his qualification was treated as complete. We are therefore of the opinion that the court below erred in treating the taking of an oath by an independent executor as essential to his legal qualification as such. We do not wish, however, to be understood as intimating that even if the law required such executors to qualify by taking an oath, a failure to comply with such provision would be fatal to liis acts when called in question collaterally, as in this case. We are further of opinion that the court below laid too much stress upon the use of the word “ full” in the opinion rendered upon the former appeal. The question before the court upon that appeal was not so much the necessity of an inventory to the validity of the sale in question, as it was the kind of evidence necessary to prove the return of such inventory. ¡Not intimation was made in that opinion of a desire or intention to overrule, or call in question, the previous cases of Cooper v. Horner, 62 Texas, 356, and Willis v. Ferguson, 46 Texas, 496, to the effect that the return of an inventory would not be essential to the validity of a sale made by an independent executor in all cases. In this case, as will be seen from the conclusions of fact, the inventory to all appearances would have been full and complete but for the statement in the affidavit that it was not complete. As to the particular land in controversy, however, it was full and complete in every particular, and we are clearly of the opinion that this addition to the affidavit made by the executor should not affect this sale. We apprehend that few inventories are returned in any estate that embrace every item of property owned by the deceased at the time of his death; and we can not see how the addition to an affidavit of a statement of a fact, which must almost of necessity exist in every case, would on a collateral attack invalidate a sale of the property in the administration of such estate. It would hardly be contended that if this addition had not been made to the affidavit, the mere fact that some item of property had been omitted from the inventory would have invalidated this sale, and we can not see how the statement that this fact did exist should have any greater weight than the existence of the fact without stating it in the affidavit. We are therefore of the opinion, that where an inventory has been returned by an executor, which includes all the property in controversy, a sale thereof can not be collaterally attacked, even though the inventory might not be complete as to other property, and that the court erred in holding differently upon the trial below. Delivered November 22, 1892. No question was made in the trial below as to the sufficiency of the evidence to show that the executor Mosely had refused to act so as to authorize his coexecutor Hall to proceed alone (Eskridge v. Patterson, 78 Texas, 417; Bennett v. Kiber, 76 Texas, 385); nor was any question made as to the failure of appellee to offer to refund the money for which the land was sold at the execution sale. Smithwick v. Kelly, 79 Texas, 576. Appellee in his brief contends that appellants are not entitled to have considered their assignments presenting the questions above discussed, because the findings of the court below were not excepted to. We do not find this sustained by the record. In the judgment rendered by the court it was duly noted that defendants excepted thereto. Voight v. Mackle, 71 Texas, 78. Besides, this case is brought before us upon a full statement of facts as well as conclusions of the trial judge, and in such cases the rule laid down by appellee does not apply. Tudor v. Hodges, 71 Texas, 392. Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and here rendered in favor of appellants for the land in controversy, and it is so ordered. Reversed and rendered.","C. U. Connellee et el v. John C. Roberts. No. 31. 1. Independent Executor — Qualification.—It was not essential to the qualification of an independent executor under the Act of 1870 (Pasch. Dig., art. 5574). that any oath as such should be taken by him. His qualification would be complete upon the probate of the will and acceptance of the trust by him, with the return of an inventory and appraisement of the estate when this was required by law. 2. Same — Return of Inventory, how far Essential. — When an inventory has been returned which includes all the property in controversy, a sale thereof can not be collaterally attacked because such inventory may not have been complete as to other property. Appeal from Eastland. Tried below before J. E. Cockrell, Esq., Special Judge. J. R. Fleming and R. B. Truly, for appellants. 1. The court erred in liis conclusion that on the former appeal of this cause the Supreme Court held, that it was essential for the defendants to prove that M. J. Hall, Jr., qualified as independent executor, and that he returned á full and complete inventory; that there is no competent evidence that either of these things was done, and consequently that the execution issued on the judgment against M. J. Hall, Jr., was void, and the sale thereunder passed no title to defendants. Roberts v. Connellee, 71 Texas, 11. 2. The acts of Hall as executor are entitled to full faith and credit. Gen. Laws 1870, pp. 163, 164, secs. 158-160; Willis v. Ferguson, 46 Texas, 496; Cooper v. Horner, 62 Texas, 356; Moody v. Butler, 63 Texas, 210; W. & W. Cond. Cases, sec. 526. An inventory is not conclusive, either for or against an executor or administrator. Pasch. Dig., art. 1302; White v. Shepperd, 16 Texas, 167. When filed it is only prima facie evidence. Little v. Birdwell, 21 Texas, 607. 3. The court should have rendered judgment for defendants under the conclusions of fact found by him. Willis v. Ferguson, 46 Texas, 496; Moody v. Butler, 63 Texas, 210; Perkins v. Wood, 63 Texas, 397; W. & W. Cond. Cases, see. 526, and cases cited. 4. The property in the hands of an independent executor becomes trust property and liable to execution at the hands of bona fide creditors, without regard to whether or not he ever returned any inventory or subscribed or had recorded the oath of office as trustee. He stands at least in the position of a de facto officer or trustee, and a valid subsisting debt, judgment, execution, and sale against the estate in favor of the creditor passes the title. Gen. Laws 1870, pp. 163, 164, secs. 158, 160; Aulanier v. Governor, 1 Texas, 653; McKinney v. O’Connor, 26 Texas, 5. J. M. Moore and J. C. Walker, for appellee. 1. The court correctly held that the appellants got no title under the deed through the pretended executor, because there was no legal proof that he ever qualified or filed an inventory. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 1333; Ins. Co. v. Milliken, 64 Texas, 48; Railway v. Fossett, 66 Texas, 338. 2. The will, the law, and the order of probate required the filing of an inventory, which was not done; besides, the executor did not qualify, and these failures defeated the independent feature of the will. Roberts v. Connellee, 71 Texas, 14; Chifflet v. Willis & Bro., 74 Texas, 253."
"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. The law applicable to this case is-that announced in the opinion rendered in the case of W. R. Baker’s Executors v. Isa R. De Freese, ante, page 524. The defense in each case is the same, and the facts are very similar. This suit is an action of trespass to try title, brought by W. R. Baker’s executors, to recover from defendant certain lots described in the petition, and situated in the city of Houston. The defendant answered by general denial; and plead specially, that the property sued for was donated to her in 1882 by her deceased brother, W. R. Baker, the plaintiffs’ testator, and that her said brother placed defendant in possession of the premises in the same year; that the lots were purchased by her brother for her, and the title taken in his name in trust for her in 1881; and in 1882 her said brother erected a dwelling upon them, and then donated both the lots and dwelling upon them to defendant; and that he ever afterwards regarded defendant as the owner of the property and vested with the absolute title thereto, and that he made this declaration at various times, and to various persons, and that he made such declaration but a few days before his death in 1890; that defendant had occupied the lots as her home continuously since 1882, and claimed the same as her property; and that in consequence of the gift of the property by her brother to her, she had made large and valuable improvements upon the same, and that said improvements were made with the full knowledge of her brother, and that she was making the same upon the belief that she was the real owner of the property, and that he made no objections to her making the improvements. She averred her improvements were of the value of $5000. She averred that she would not have made such improvements if she had not believed that the property was hers. Defendant further averred, that by reason of all the above facts, plaintiffs were estopped from claiming said property; and she prayed that plaintiffs take nothing by their suit, and for specific performance of the said donation by decree of the court, and that she be quieted in her title and possession. Plaintiffs, by supplemental'petition, denied that the improvements made by defendant added anything to the value of the property, and averred that the improvements were only such as contributed to the comfort and convenience of the defendant, and such as any conscientious tenant would place upon land occupied by him. And plaintiffs further averred, that the lots in controversy were never given to defendant; that they were improved by Baker for the purpose of allowing defendant to occupy the same at his pleasure; that Baker was a cautious, prudent, and methodical business man, and well read in the land laws of Texas; and that during all the time the premises were occupied by defendant the property was assessed in his (Baker’s) name, and the taxes thereon paid by him, and that the property was also insured by Baker in his name, and the premiums paid by him; that the rental value of the property was $50 per month, and that during all the time defendant occupied the premises Baker paid her monthly $150, which sum was more than sufficient to compensate defendant for any outlay made by her in improvements, and for any labor and care bestowed by her in improving and preserving the premises. Defendant, by supplemental answer, denied the allegation of plaintiffs’ supplemental petition, and averred, that if the property was insured by Baker, and if he paid the taxes thereon, it was done by him as her agent, and for her use and benefit, and that the said Baker did not intend thereby to assert any right to the property, but only intended thereby to protect the defendant in her title and ownership of the same. The cause was tried on May 21, 1891, and verdict and judgment were rendered for the defendant, and plaintiffs appealed. The evidence of the purchase and improvement of the lots by Baker for the defendant, and his donation of the same to her, and his placing her in possession of the premises, and her continued occupancy of the same, and Baker’s frequent and continuous admission that the property was the defendant’s, and that he had bought it and improved it for her and had given it to her, that he had no claim on it, was full and convincing. The improvements made by the defendant (and their nature and character show that many of them were permanent and valuable), and that they were made with the knowledge of and without objection by the said Baker, were also established by the evidence. The value of all the improvements was shown to be about $2000. Plaintiffs proved that Mr. Baker was a careful and prudent man of business, and that he assessed the property in his name and paid the taxes thereon, and that he insured the house upon the lots in his name, and described them as occupied by a tenant, and paid the premiums himself; and that he also insured the property in the house in the name of the defendant, and also paid the insurance himself; and the rental value of the premises was shown to be in excess of the improvements from $300 to $500 for the eight years they were occupied by defendant previous to the institution of this suit. Our conclusions upon the law are, that under the foregoing facts, the judgment rendered for the defendant was a proper one, and such as should have been rendered, and that the same should be affirmed, and it is now so ordered. Affirmed. Delivered March 9, 1893.","W. R. Baker’s Executors v. Julia W. Clark. No. 112. Parol Gift—When Irrevocable.—The lots were purchased by Baker and given to appellee, and she was placed in possession by him. Permanent and valuable improvements were made by her, with the knowledge of Baker, and without objection on his part. He made frequent and continuous admissions that the property was hers, rendered it for taxes in his own name, and insured the property in the house in the name of Mrs. Clark, who was his sister, and paid her in money $150 per month.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This is a suit by appellee against appellant for damages in the sum of $5700 actual and $10,000 exemplary damages. The petition alleges: That defendant employs many thousand men in different capacities as laborers and servants, nearly all of whom do occasionally visit the city of Houston upon business or pleasure; that many thousands of the people who inhabit the many towns and cities along defendant’s said lines of railway visit the city of Houston, and have been accustomed so to do for more than one year last past; that by reason of its immense business connections and its great army of employes, the defendant possesses great power and influence for good or evil. That plaintiff, since the 1st day of June, 1888, has been and is now the proprietor of the boarding house and saloon attached thereto on the corner of Congress and Caroline Streets, in the city of Houston, in- Harris County, Texas, called the Commercial Hotel. That on or about the 1st day of June, 1888, the said defendant company did unlawfully, wickedly, maliciously, and oppressively institute and inaugurate a “boycott” against plaintiff, and did use its immense power and influence to drive away his custom and patrons and destroy his business. That on or about the 1st day of November, 1888, one McElyea, a division road master on the Gulf division of defendant’s road, whose business in the line of his duty is and was to employ more than 1000 men, and work and control them in keeping a great many miles of said defendant’s road in repair, did assume to act for and by authority of defendant, and did vigorously and maliciously prosecute said boycott so instituted and created by defendant against plaintiff as aforesaid, and did publicly declare it to be his intention to discharge and refuse employment to any and all men who should in any way patronize plaintiff, either by eating at his house or drinking at his bar. That said McElyea did discharge, in November and December, 1888,. a number of men because of their friendship to and patronage of plaintiff; that said conduct of McElyea did alienate many of the friends of plaintiff, whereby plaintiff lost much trade. That said McElyea did, about the 1st day of November, 1888, in Harris County, Texas, and at many other times and places, both before and after said day and date, instruct his section foremen of said division of defendant’s road to discharge and refuse employment to any one known to patronize and deal with plaintiff. That in November and December, 1888, employment was and still is scarce and difficult to obtain for common laborers; that influenced by the aforesaid conduct and threats of said McElyea, many of plaintiff’s patrons left him, and many others were deterred and prevented from patronizing him. That the defendant did know and was fully informed of, about, and concerning the conduct of its servants and officials in their boycott of and injury to plaintiff on and from the 1st day of June, 1888, or by due diligence might have known; that defendant was fully informed of said conduct of it servants about the 1st day of November, 1888. That defendant was specially informed by plaintiff, about January 4, 1889, of the said boycott and conduct of its servants, and especially of McElyea and his conduct, and of plaintiff’s injury therefrom, and relief demanded. But the defendant wholly refused plaintiff any redress, and fully ratified, confirmed, and made its own all the aforesaid acts and conduct of all its said servants, and more especially the wicked, malicious, and cruelly oppressive conduct of said McElyea. That the aforesaid conduct of defendant has driven away custom and trade from plaintiff, and injured his business to the amount and value of $100 per month from June 1, 1888, to and until the present time. That by reason of the aforesaid boycott by defendant against plaintiff, and by reason of the conduct and manner of defendant and its servants in the prosecution and continuance thereof, the plaintiff has been constantly annoyed, vexed, harassed, pained, wounded, and injured in his mind and feelings, to his great damage and injury, to-wit, in the sum of $5000. That by the wicked, cruel, malicious, and oppressive conduct of defendant toward plaintiff as aforesaid, plaintiff has been injured in the further sum of $10,000 exemplary damages. The defendant answered by general demurrer and general denial. The former was overruled, and a trial by jury followed, in which the plaintiff recovered a verdict for $100 actual and $300 exemplary damages. The first assignment of error brings in question the correctness of the overruling of the general demurrer by the court below. Appellant contends that the petition fails to state a cause of action; because, first, no conspiracy was alleged; second, under the facts alleged, appellant had the right “ to prohibit its employes or servants from attending any place of resort, such as a saloon and boarding house combined, under penalty of being discharged,” and therefore did no wrong to appellee in issuing the order; third, the business alleged to have been injured was not averred to have been lawful; and fourth, there was no allegation that prior to the alleged wrongful acts of appellant appellee enjoyed the custom for the loss of which recovery is sought, and that he lost it through such wrongful act. 1. The first point seems to be, that the term “ boycott” imports a conspiracy, and that the use of that term rendered it necessary for the pleader to show that a conspiracy existed. Whether or not this word has acquired, in modern usage, a meaning sufficiently definite for a court to take notice of when used in pleading, without explanation, is a question not very material to this case. (See a discussion of the point in cases referred to in 2 American and English Encyclopedia of Law, 512.) The term, so far as its import is developed, does not seem very applicable to the transaction alleged in the petition. But the legal characteristics of the cause of action are to be determined from the act alleged, and not from the name by which the pleader calls it. If that act is in law such as to give rise to a cause of action, the naming of it does not alter its character. The objection to the petition, that it does not allege a conspiracy, is not well taken, if the act charged against appellant was a legal wrong to appellee, for which he may maintain an action. The act might be committed as well by one as by many. It is held in the case of Delz v. Norman, 80 Texas, 403, that a mere conspiracy is not actionable unless the act done thereby would be actionable if done by one singly. Whether this is true as broadly as it is stated or not (Bishop on Noncontract Law, section 357, et seq.), it can not be doubted that an injury to one’s trade which will subject the guilty party to liability for damages resulting therefrom may be inflicted without a conspiracy. This brings us to the second objection. 2. Did appellant have the right to prohibit its servants from patronizing appellee’s hotel and saloon ? If in issuing the order or threat it only exercised a legal right, it may be admitted that appellee can not complain, though it resulted in loss to him, whatever may have been the motive with which the act was done. If appellant would have had the right to discharge its servants for doing the forbidden things, then it must follow that it could lawfully notify them that it would exercise it. - It had the same right to discharge its servants as all masters have under similar conditions. This right was not to dismiss the servants arbitrarily or capriciously, but for reasonable causes only. Were the acts, the doing of which appellant declared to its servants should be the cause of their discharge, such as would justify the action which was threatened ? The allegation is, that the employes were threatened with discharge if they “in any way patronized plaintiff, either by eating at his house or drinking at his bar.” We think it too plain, that, as thus stated, there would have been no just ground for discharging the servants for doing what they were thus forbidden to do. This is charged to have been done maliciously, with intent to injure plaintiff. The employes, presumably, had the right to eat and drink where they chose, so long as they violated no contract with their employer and performed their service well, and the malicious use of such moral coercion upon them by the appellant as this petition alleges, for the purpose of injuring appellee, was wrongful, and made appellant liable for such damages as was thereby inflicted. Appellant did not have the right to intentionally induce others to abstain from patronizing appellee, except for a legitimate purpose. Delz v. Norman, supra. According to the allegations, it did, by threats of unlawful discharge, cause its servants to withdraw their patronage, with intent to injure appellee. This was not the exercise of a legal right, as contended, and the second proposition of appellant can not be sustained. What we have said applies only to the rights of the master with reference to servants already in his employ. It is proper to say in regard to the alleged notice, that appellant would not take into its service any who might patronize appellee, that appellant had the right to determine for itself whom it would thereafter employ, and the reasons upon which it might act concerned no one but itself. Bish. Noncon. Law, sec. 144; Heywood v. Tilson, 75 Me., 225. To what extent a master may exercise his influence with his employes, to promote their welfare, as well as to protect his own interests which are dependent upon their action, is not involved in the decision of this demurrer. The petition excludes the idea that the action complained of was taken for any legitimate purpose. 3. It was not necessary that the petition should allege that the business was lawful. The keeping of a hotel is, per se, a lawful business. The sale of liquor may become so by a compliance with the law regulating it. The law would presume that appellee was conducting his business lawfully. He was not required to anticipate a charge that he was violating the law, and to negative it by affirmative allegations. 4. The fourth proposition is met by the petition, which does show that appellee lost the custom of employes by reason of appellant’s conduct, sufficiently at least to meet a general demurrer. Our conclusion therefore is, that the demurrer was properly overruled. The ruling of the court in sustaining objection to the question asked by appellant of the witness Beordan, as stated in the third assignment, can not be revised, because the bill of exceptions does not state what the answer would have been. Under a general denial we do not think appellant could interpose the defense that plaintiff’s business was unlawful. If it desired to make such a defense it should have pleaded it. The appellant requested the following special charge, which was refused: et If you believe from the evidence that the defendant company, or its agents, did instruct ""its employes not to patronize the plaintiff’s hotel and saloon, but did so to prevent troublesome litigation with plaintiff, or interference with their customs or regulations with their employes, but not for the purpose of injury to plaintiff or his business, you will find for the defendant.” We think this was'rightly refused. Appellant might doubtless adopt appropriate measures with its employes, to prevent troublesome litigation with plaintiff, but it could not interfere with his legitimate business in order to do so. How it was nececessary to forbid patronage of that business in order to prevent litigation is not made to appear. It is shown that some of the employes in trading with appellee had transferred to him their papers, by which their right to receive wages from appellant was in some way evidenced, and that harassing suits had been brought by appellee from time to time upon such claims. Had such assignments alone been forbidden, upon penalty of discharge to the employes, a different question would be before us. Such is not the case. There is no assignment which questions the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict, except the seventh, and that is too general to raise any question concerning the finding of the jury, save the allowance of exemplary damages. We have considered the evidence bearing upon this, point, and conclude as a fact that the act of appellant was not done maliciously, nor with reckless or wanton disregard of appellee’s rights; and that therefore the verdict for exemplary damages is not sustained. There are in the record two bills of exception, complaining of language used by appellee’s counsel in addressing the jury. As to the first, it is shown that the court checked and rebuked the counsel and properly instructed the jury. In the other instance counsel was permitted to state to the jury that the reason appellee had not brought forward more of the employes of appellant who had been discharged for patronizing appellee or had withheld their custom from him, was that they had been discharged by the defendant, and had gone like migratory birds and could not be found by plaintiff. Objections made by appellant’s counsel to this were overruled, the court stating in explanation of the bill of exceptions that there was evidence that the employes “ were ever transient, changing continually.” Such evidence is not found in the statement of facts. There was no evidence that defendant had discharged its employes, nor that plaintiff could not have found them, and the statement ought not to have been allowed. The fact stated was not one calculated to arouse passion or prejudice, and as the verdict is not attacked as not being supported by the evidence as to actual damages, in view of the disposition we will make of the case, it will not be necessary to notice this error further than to condemn it. If appellee will within ten days file in this court a remitter of the exemplary damages ($300) the judgment will be affirmed, otherwise it will be reversed and remanded. Delivered January 26, 1893.","International & Great Northern Railway Company v. Thomas Greenwood. No. 102. 1. Boycott — Interference with Plaintiff’s Business.—A petition of a hotel and saloon keeper which in substance avers, that defendant employs many thousand men, who occasionally visit Houston; that defendant had instituted a boycott against plaintiff, and used its immense power and influence to drive away his customers; that its division road master, who employs more than a thousand men, by authority of defendant, vigorously prosecuted the boycott, and publicly declared that he would discharge and refuse employment to men who patronized plaintiff, and did discharge a number of men on that account, and instructed his foremen to refuse employment to plaintiff's patrons; that defendant was fully informed of the conduct of its servants, and ratified it, whereby plaintiff has been damaged in his business $100 per month from June, 1888, to day of trial, states a cause of action good against a general demurrer. 2. The word “Boycott.” — Whether it has acquired in modern usage a meaning sufficiently definite for a court to take notice of in pleading, without explanation, is not material in this case. So far as its import is developed, the term boycott does not seem very applicable. 3. Injury to Trade.—The acts alleged, and not the name given them, determine the legal characteristics of the-cause of action; and though no conspiracy be charged, injury to one’s trade, inflicted without a conspiracy, will subject the guilty party to damages. 4. Right of Master over Servants’ Bating and Drinking.—A master has the right to discharge his servants for reasonable causes only, and it would have been no just ground for discharging its servants because they ate at plaintiff’s house or drank at his bar. They presumably had the right to eat and drink where they chose, so long as they violated no contract with their employer, and performed their service well; and the malicious use of such moral coercion as the petition alleges, for the purpose of injuring plaintiff, was wrongful, and made the-defendant liable for the damages thereby inflicted. 5. Terms of Employment. — The master has the right to determine for himself whom he will employ, and therefore defendant had the right to give notice that for the future it would not employ any one who patronized plaintiff. The reasons upon which it might act concerned no one but itself. 6. Lawful Business.—It was not necessary that the petition should allege that plaintiff’s business was lawful. Keeping a hotel is per se a lawful business, and selling liquor may become so by compliance with the law regulating it. 7. Charge Properly Refused.—“If you believe from the evidence that defendant company, or its agents, did instruct its employes not to patronize the plaintiff’s hotel and saloon, but did so to prevent troublesome litigation with, plaintiff, or interference with their customs or regulations with their employes,, but not for the purpose of injury to plaintiff or his business, you will find for the-defendant,” properly refused. How such order would prevent litigation is not made to appear. 8. Exemplary Damages.—Adjudged, that the act of defendant was not done wantonly or maliciously, and plaintiff was not entitled to exemplary damages, and he is given ten days within which to remit the exemplary damages found by the jury, or case reversed.

A petition in a suit to recover damages for an alleged boycott must show on its face, by proper averment, a conspiracy entered into by the defendants to prevent the plaintiff, who was engaged in a lawful business, from carrying on his business, or to injure him therein, and it must be alleged that whatever damages the plaintiff sustained in his said business was caused by the boycott of defendant. 2 Am. and Eng.

An employer or master has the right to prohibit, by command, his employes or servants from attending any place of resort, such as a saloon ■and boarding house combined, under penalty of being discharged' from his service if they violate such command or rule, and no action will lie against such master or employer by the owner or proprietor of such place for making and enforcing against his servants or employes such command. 3 Wait’s Act. and Def., 601, 602; 4 Wait’s Act. and Def., 403, sec. 10, .and authorities; Wood on Mast, and Serv., secs. 109-118; 75 Texas, 634. 3.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. The decision of our Supreme Court on the question referred to it by us holds, that a plea to the jurisdiction of the trial court on the ground that the amount in controversy has been fraudulently stated, must be filed in the due order of pleading before an answer to the merits. The action of the court below in overruling the motion of appellant to strike out such plea interposed by appellees, after they had filed a general demurrer and general denial, must therefore be held error which will require a reversal of the judgment. The allegations in appellant’s petition in the court below upon which he sought a recovery are, in substance, that on the-day of November, 1889, plaintiff was the owner and in possession of the following described property, to-wit, six bales of cotton of the value of $59 per bale. That the said defendants on said day did wrongfully, unlawfully, with force, and without the consent of plaintiff, seize and take all of said property from his possession, and convert it to their own use. The petition also alleges such taking to have been willful and with full knowledge, and claims both actual and exemplary damages. To sustain his allegations, appellant offered evidence tending to show, that in the spring of 1889 his father gave him the use of 20 acres of land, which was a part of his homestead, and that the cotton in controversy, except one bale, was raised on this land, and that at the time alleged appellees took it from his possession by virtue of an execution against L. Hoffman, the father of appellant. Appellees answered by a general denial; and appellant contends, that in this state of the pleading the only issue in the case was that of possession. This question of pleading, in a case strikingly similar, is so fully considered in Willis v. Hudson, 63 Texas, 678, that we shall not undertake to add anything to what is there said. We understand that case to hold, that if the cotton was placed in the name of appellant to hold for his father, with no intention that as between them the title should pass to the former, this can be shown under a general denial, even though the transaction may have been undertaken to defeat the creditors of the latter. In such case, the ownership of the cotton would be in the father, and the son’s possession would be the father’s possession, just as the servant’s possession is the master’s possession. But if the parties to this transaction really intended the title to the cotton to vest in the son as between them, and the appellees relied upon their right to defeat such transfer as being in fraud of their rights as creditors of the father, special pleading on their part would be required. In submitting the case to the jury, the court instructed them, in general terms, if they found that plaintiff was the owner of any of the cotton at the time of the levy, to find in his favor for its value, otherwise to find for defendants; and under this charge the jury returned the following verdict: “ We, the jury, find in favor of the plaintiff actual damages in the sum of $59, with interest at 8 per cent per annum from the 5tli day of November, 1889. We, the jury, find no sum in favor of the plaintiff as exemplary damages. We, the jury, find that the amount in controversy was falsely and fraudulently stated by the plaintiff to be more than the sum of $200, for the purpose of giving this court jurisdiction of the case, and therefore we find for the defendant on his special plea setting up those facts.” Upon this verdict a straight judgment was rendered for the defendant. Under the decision of our Supreme Court, it will be necessary that this judgment be reversed and here rendered for appellant for $59 and interest thereon at 8 per cent from the 5th day of November. 1889, together with all costs of this court and the court below. Appellant contends, that the verdict finding him not to be the owner of the remainder of the cotton can not be sustained by the evidence, but we can not agree with this. The evidence was undisputed, that one bale of the cotton was raised upon land rented by appellant from other parties than his father, and this is evidently the bale the jury allowed him. As to the cotton raised on L. Hoffman’s land, we think the verdict amply sustained. The evidence shows that L. Hoffman had a large family, and owned only a small place with from 40 to 45 acres in cultivation. The 20 acres upon which this cotton was raised was all the land on that place cultivated in cotton that year. This cotton was cultivated and picked by L. Hoffman, aided by his other children as well as appellant, in the way we would expect to find it done had it belonged to him. Appellant was a minor, and had several acres of cotton on land rented from other parties. Of the cotton that had been sold prior to the levy, L. Hoffman had received by far the greater portion of the proceeds, ostensibly as a gift from Ms son. A witness who worked in the same field with appellant and his father while the crop was being cultivated, testified to several conversations with both of them, in which they agreed that the cotton on the father’s land belonged to him, and that on the rented land to appellant. The father was in debt beyond his ability to pay. So that without considering the statements of the father made in the absence of appellant, introduced for the purpose of contradiction, we think the circumstances amply sufficient to sustain the conclusion of the jury, that there was no intention as between father and son that this cotton should belong to the latter. We incline to think, that had we been trying the case in the court below, we would have arrived at the same conclusion. We find no error in the rulings of the court below in the admission and rejection of evidence. The assignment calling in question the action of the court below in refusing special charges requested by appellant is too general to authorize its consideration by us over the objection of appellees.. We think it would have been better had the court below been more specific in applying the law to the issues raised by the evidence, but we can not remand on this account, in the state of the record as presented to us, without extending to the assignments of error a degree of liberality denied in other cases. Let the judgment of the court below be reversed and here rendered as indicated in this opinion. Reversed and rendered. Delivered March 30, 1893.","J. J. Hoffman v.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. Suit by C. P. Scott, the appellee, against Llano County, filed January 10, 1888, to recover damages alleged to have been occasioned by the establishment of a public road over his land by order of the Commissioners Court, made on the 17th day of February, 1887, pursuant to report of a jury of review appointed by a previous order. The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $105 and costs, from which the county has appealed. On the 14th of February, 1887, the Commissioners Court of Llano County, of its own motion, under authority of the first section of the Act of February, 1884, as stated in the order, passed an order appointing five freeholders, plaintiff one of them, as a jury of view to lay out a first class public road from the town of Llano, county seat of Llano County, to the line of San Saba County, in the direction of the town of San Saba, the county seat of San Saba County. All the jury but plaintiff, on the 17th of February, 1887, made their report, showing survey of the road agreed on, running diagonally across plaintiff’s land on a line about 1100 varas in length. Plaintiff made a minority report, protesting against the establishing of the road as run, alleging that he would be greatly damaged thereby, and that the road could be established on his boundary line without making it more than a quarter of a mile longer, and none would be injured. On the same day the court adopted the majority report, and established it as a first class road. Plaintiff claimed no damages at this time, and no provision was made by the court for such purpose, but on the 10th of May, 1887, he applied to the court to appoint a jury to assess the damages, which he laid at $500, and on the same day the claim was rejected, and no damages allowed, “ for the reason that petitioner was one of the jury of view and did not file his account for damages as required by law.” Nothing further was done in the Commissioners Court. Whereupon this suit was brought in the District Court, setting up the foregoing facts. Defendant county excepted to the sufficiency of the petition, upon the ground that the injuries complained of and the assessment of damages were cognizable only by the Commissioners Court. Defendant also answered by general denial, except as to the allegation of laying out and establishing the road where alleged; and especially, that for seven years before the 17th of February, 1887, on that date, and up to the filing of the suit, the county had an old established road leading from the town of Llano to San Saba town, the general direction of the new road as laid out, and that the old road crossed plaintiff’s land at the same place where the new road was established, the jury adopting at such points the old road, making the bed of the old and the new substantially the same at the place indicated on plaintiff’s land. It is also set up in defense, that plaintiff was one of the jury of view locating the new road, a majority of whom laid out the road through plaintiff’s land; that he was present, and presented no claim to the jury of view for his damages for the appropriation of his land, and had made no such “ statement” to the Commissioners Court, and had taken no steps to bring the claim before that court for adjustment. It is also set up, “that for thirty years, and while the land over which the road runs was public domain, the public acquired and has since maintained over said roadbed through said tract of land a constant right of way, adequate in width, to-wit, 60 feet wide, to meet the public demands, and that the said roadway the whole of said time has been continuously and peaceably kept public for all purposes of a free and unobstructed passage, and that no part of said roadbed has ever been discontinued, nor has the easement in said passage' ever been in anywise diminished; that on and for more than three years prior to the 17th of February, 1887, Llano County has held in trust for the said travelling public 30 feet width of said roadbed, and styled said portion of said roadbed a second class road, and works the same as such; that in 1882, plaintiff’s vendor, Cr. W. Jernigan, acquired title to said land by pre-emption; that at the time said title was so acquired, and for a long time anterior thereto, to-wit, twenty years, the travelling public was holding and peaceably using said part of said roadbed as a public, free, and unobstructed highway, and that when plaintiff came into possession of the said 160 acres of land the travelling public had a vested easement of a public, free, and unobstructed passage over said road, adequate in width to meet the demands of the public, to-wit, 60 feet wide, and that plaintiff does now and has ever held the fee in said road in trust for the public use; wherefore defendant prays” for judgment, etc. Defendant moved to strike out the several exhibits showing the orders and reports to the Commissioners Court, because ‘ ‘ the same are merely evidence in the ease.” The court overruled the motion, and also the demurrers and exceptions to the petition. There are a number of assignments of error, but only a few questions to be disposed of, which will be done without considering each assignment in its order. Did the District Court have jurisdiction of the case, as presented ? We think unquestionably it had. The County Commissioners Court declined to consider plaintiff’s claim for damages. The alleged cause for so doing was, that he was one of the jury that surveyed the road, and failed to present his claim to them, as required by article 4371, Sayles’ •Civil Statutes (amendment of same article in Revised Statutes), and that he so waived his right to damages, as declared in article 4372 of Sayles’ •Civil Statutes. In the first place, we hold that there was no waiver. Before the failure to present the claim for damages would have the effect of a waiver* other parts of the law must be complied with. The jury are required (article 4370) to issue notice in writing to the land owners through whose lands a proposed road may run, or to agents, of the time when they will lay out the same, or when they will assess the damages incidental to the opening of the same, which notice shall be served upon the owner or agent at least five days before the day named. This notice is the initial step, the original writ, that invokes the jurisdiction of the jury and the Commissioners Court, and requires the land owner to appear and make claim for damages. If he does not appear after such notice and state his damages, he waives them, according to article 4372; but if he makes his claim, it is made the duty of the' jury to assess the damages and report the same with their report of survey to the Commissioners Court, which then estimates the damages—an adequate compensation for the land taken. We do not wish to be understood as holding that there could be a waiver under article 4372, under a regular proceeding. It is not necessary to decide the point in this case. No notice was issued or served upon the plaintiff by the jury of. view.. This mode of estimating the damages and compensating plaintiff for the land taken was entirely ignored by the jury and the court. The statute does not require the jury to assess the damages at the same time they lay off the road; the notice may fix another time for this purpose. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 4370. But no notice of any kind was served upon plaintiff. In such case there could be no waiver. His presence as one of the jury could not bind him. The proceeding to assess the damages had not been instituted, and he was not bound to make the claim at the time. He protested against their running the road through the land, and made a minority report as one of the jury. After the court adopted the majority report and appropriated his land, he asked the court to appoint a jury to assess his damages. This was the mode of having the damage» assessed under the Revised Statutes (article 4371), referred to in article 4360a of the amended law, but article 4371 of the old law was amended only two days before article 4360a was added to the old law. It is not necessary that we should determine what act was referred to in article 4360a. Let it be admitted that it referred to article 4371 as amended two days before, it is still true that plaintiff had not been notified to appear before the forum authorized to assess his damages, and had waived no right to the same. When he saw that his land was to be taken without compensation, he-applied to the Commissioners Court to have a jury appointed to assess his damages, and was denied a hearing. The court refused to consider his claim. The District Court had jurisdiction, the amount claimed being within its jurisdiction. Had the proceeding authorized by the statute been set in motion as prescribed, and had the Commissioners Court acted upon the claim and adjusted the damages according to their discretion, the question would be different. He was not allowed the right to have his claim passed on by the Commissioners Court or the jury. His land was taken without his consent; the authorities of the county who might have organized á forum under the statute to try his right failed to do so, and now it is insisted that he can not resort to the regular courts of the country to have his rights determined, because they have no jurisdiction. The position is not sound. It has been held that where the Commissioners Court fails to comply with the law, the District Court has jurisdiction end can grant relief. Bounds v. Kirven, 63 Texas, 161. It is said by appellant that plaintiff should have appealed from the action of the Commissioners Court. We do not decide that he could have appealed. It is sufficient that the court failed to comply with the law in taking his land without his consent and without compensation. This confers jurisdiction on the regular courts of the country. Changing a road from a second class to a first class road necessarily requires more land from the owner, and it can only be done upon compensation. The long use by the county of a second class road could not be applied to the first class road • 60 feet in width. There is no prescription in the case for a road of any class. Cunningham v. San Saba County, 1 Texas Civ. App., 480. We are of opinion that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed. Delivered February 1, 1893.","Llano County v. C. P. Scott. No. 76. . 1. Laying out Public Road—Damages—Waiver.—In taking land for a public road established by the County Commissioners Court, notice to the land owner is the initial step, conferring jurisdiction upon the jury of view to assess damages. Where no notice is given, as prescribed, a failure to make claim before the jury of view is not a waiver of damages. 2. Same.—That a land owner was a member of a jury of view a majority of which laid out a road over his land against his protest, does not prevent his asserting a claim for damages for his land so taken. 3.

That plaintiff had waived his claim for damages, as declared by the statute. If this right to claim damages were not waived, and plaintiff’s claim for damages, presented at a subsequent term of the court could be entertained by it, being rejected by the court, his remedy was by appeal to the District Court, provided by the statute full and complete, and defendant’s demurrer should have been sustained.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. H. S. Holman was justice of the peace of Precinct No. 1, Cooke County. In his court this suit was instituted by appellants as plaintiffs against appellee as defendant. Judgment was rendered for appellee, from which appellants appealed to the County Court of Cooke County. Pending the appeal Holman was elected county judge of Cooke County. When the cause was called for trial in the County Court, Holman, the county judge, declined to take jurisdiction thereof. He held that he was disqualified to try the case, from the fact that he had tried it as justice of the peace, and for this reason transferred it to the District Court of Cooke County. A trial in the District Court resulted in a judgment for appellee, from which appellants appeal. It is urged that the District Court was without jurisdiction to try the case, the County Court having erred in the transfer referred to, and that this appeal should be dismissed. We hold that the fact that the county judge had presided at the trial in the Justice Court did not disqualify him from hearing the case in the County Court, and did not justify its transfer to the District Court. Rev. Stats., art. 1138; Railway v. Holden, 3 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 323.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Prior to October, 1881, Wilbarger County was unorganized, and constituted part of the Clay Land District. In October, 1881, said county organized and elected all its county officers, including a county surveyor, who qualified as required by law. On the 28th of April, 1882, J. R. Nigh, county surveyor of Wilbarger County, received from the district surveyor of the Clay Land District a map of the surveys theretofore made in Wilbarger County, and a copy of Ml files, applications, and locations of lands in said county, all of which were filed in the surveyor’s office in Wilbarger County on the 29th of April, 1882. No survey of any of the boundary lines of Wilbarger County was made prior to 1883. On March 5, 1883, the Commissioners Court of Wilbarger County ordered the county surveyor to survey and establish the south and west boundary lines of that county. Before making this survey, notice was given the County Court of Baylor County, but no notice was given the County Court of Hardeman County, nor does it appear from the record whether or not said last named county was organized at this time so that, such notice could be given. In compliance with this order of the Commissioners Court of Wilbarger County, the surveyor of said county surveyed the south and west lines of same, and recorded the field notes thereof in the records of the surveyor’s office on the 14th day of May, 1883, and a copy of this work was returned to the General Land Office, but was not accepted by the Commissioner on account of defects therein, and nothing further was done towards establishing the boundary lines of said county, as required by the Act of April 22, 1879. On the 29th of April, 1882, appellant T. J. Sams, being the owner of Confederate certificate number 1697, issued to W. T. Eidson, filed the same with the surveyor of Wilbarger County, accompanied by an application signed by his father, C. A. Sams, to survey the land in controversy thereunder. A survey upon this file was made by said surveyor,, and returned to the General Land Office July 26,1882, where it remained until August 4, 1882, when the Commissioner, without having placed his file mark upon it, returned the field notes to the surveyor of Wilbarger County, because of defects therein, and because there was no evidence on file in his office that Wilbarger County had organized as a separate land district. This survey was again returned to the Land Office by the surveyor of Wilbarger County on October 13, 1882, and on October 23,1882, the Commissioner again returned it to the surveyor on account of defects therein. On January 17, 1883, appellant Sams again returned this survey to the General Land Office, and on. February 26, 1883, the Commissioner returned it to him, because the survey was incorrect. The survey was again returned to the General Land Office July 12,1883, when it was marked “filed” by the Commissioner; but this filing was more than twelve months after the date of the survey, which was made May 5, 1882. On November 25, 1882, appellee Creager, being the owner of Confederate certificate number 1419, issued to A. J. Williams, filed the same with the surveyor of Wilbarger County, accompanied with the proper application to survey the land in controversy; but before any survey was-made, he having been advised by the Commissioner of the General Land Office that Wilbarger County was not a separate land district, and was still attached to the Clay Land District for surveying purposes, withdrew said certificate from the office of the county surveyor of Wilbarger County, for the purpose of filing the same in the office of the surveyor of the Clay-Land District. On the 17th of March, 1883, he filed said certificate with said last named surveyor, accompanied with the proper application to survey the land in controversy, and on the 29th of May, 1883, said surveyor made the survey, and the field notes were duly returned to the General Land Office July 14, 1883. The surveyor of Wilbarger County also assisted in making this survey, and recorded the field notes in his office. Upon this survey patent was issued to Creager on December 22, 1884. On March 28, 1883, one J. K. P. Russéll, being the owner of Confederate certificate number 1341, issued to E. J. Logsdon, filed the same with the surveyor of Wilbarger County, accompanied with the proper application to survey the land in controversy; and a survey was made by said surveyor under this file June 29, 1833, and filed in the General Land Office October 18, 1883. Appellant Marsalis claims under this location. The record does not show affirmatively that this last named certificate was ever filed with the county surveyor of Wilbarger County; but from the fact that the survey was made and returned to the General Land Office, we conclude that it was properly accompanied with the certificate. Because the boundary lines of Wilbarger County had never been established as required by the Act of April 22, 1879, the Commissioner of the General Land Office refused to recognize the surveys made by the surveyor of said county, and issued'the patent upon the survey made by the surveyor of the Clay Land District; and appellant Marsalis brought this suit in the court below as plaintiff, against appellant Sams and appellee Creager and others, to establish the priority of his claim by reason of the facts above set forth. Judgment was rendered in favor of appellees, from which this appeal is prosecuted both by the claimant under the Russell and the Sams locations. It is contended by appellants, that section 10 of the Act of April 22, 1879, is unconstitutional, because said act embraces more than one subject, and the subject of this section is not expressed in the title thereto. The title of this act is as follows: “An act establishing and prescribing the manner of ascertaining the boundaries of counties.” Then follows a full and complete revision of our law upon the subject of establishing the boundary lines of counties, and the manner in which they shall be surveyed; and section 10 provides, that “Before any county in this State not already organized as a land district under existing law shall be recognized . as such, the County Court shall cause the boundary lines of the county to be surveyed and marked, and the field notes and map of such survey duly recorded and returned to the General Land Office as provided in this act.” It is not contended that this section of the law had been complied with at the time the surveyor of Wilbarger County made the surveys under which appellants claim; but it is contended that this section of the law is unconstitutional; and also, when construed in connection with section 1, the survey called for therein was not required to be made until it was ordered by the County Court or by the Commissioner of the General Land Office. Without entering into an extended discussion of the question, we are of opinion that section 10 wras sufficiently embraced within the subject and title of the act, and is therefore constitutional. The reasons which lead us to this conclusion will be found discussed at length in the cases of Railway v. Smith, 54 Texas, 10; Stone v. Brown, 54 Texas, 341; Day Co. v. The State, 68 Texas, 542. The subject of this act is the establishing of the boundary lines of the different counties in the State, and we think the Legislature in the same act could well provide the consequences to be attached to a failure to comply with its provisions. We are also of opinion, that section 1 of the act was intended to apply to eases xvhere the boundary lines of counties had never been established in compliance with its provisions, although they may have previously been organized as a separate land district; and section 10 was intended to require the boundary lines of all unorganized counties in future to be well defined under its provisions before being recognized as a separate land district. It follows, therefore, from what we have said, that we are of opinion that the surveyor of Wilbarger County, at the time the surveys for both of the appellants were made, had no authority to make the same, and in such eases it has been held that his acts are void. Cox v. Railway, 68 Texas, 226. Article 3822, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, provides, that “Any unorganized county or newly created district which may fail or refuse to organize as a separate land district as provided by law, shall continue to form a part of the district to which it was formerly attached,” etc. From the findings of fact, it will be seen that Wilbarger County formerly belonged to the Clay Land District; and as appellee had his survey made by the surveyor of that district, the patent issued thereon constituted the superior right to the land. A number of other interesting questions are presented by the record, but what we have said disposes of the entire case, and it will therefore be unnecessary for us to consider them. Let the judgment of the court below be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 16, 1893. A motion for rehearing was overruled.","T. L. Marsalis and T. J. Sams v. J. A. Creager et al. No. 98. 1. Title of Act —County Boundaries. — Section 10 of the Act of April '22, 1879, providing, that before any county not already organized as a land district under existing law shall be recognized as such, the County Court shall cause its boundary lines to be surveyed and marked, and the field notes and maps of such survey duly recorded, returned to the General Land Office, as provided in that act, can not be held unconstitutional on the ground that its subject matter is not embraced in the title of the act, viz., “An act establishing and prescribing the manner of ascertaining the boundaries of counties.’’ 2. Organization of County as Separate Land District. — Section 10 of the Act of April 22, 1879, was intended to require that the boundary lines of all unorganized counties should in future be well defined under its provisions before being recognized as a separate land district; while section 1 of the act was intended to apply to counties that may have been previously organized as separate land districts. 3. Survey in Organized County not a Separate Land District, Invalid.—W. county, which formed part of the C. land district, was organized in 1881, but it did not appear that the boundary lines of the county were ever surveyed and field notes thereof returned to the General Land Office under the Act of 1879. Held, that the location of a certificate on land therein, made upon application to and survey by the county surveyor of W. county in 1882, was void, and an adverse location made in 1883 through the district surveyor of the C. land district conferred the superior right to the land.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This action was brought by appellee to recover 177 acres of land situated in Wichita County. The land was located many years ago by virtue of an unlocated balance of the head-right certificate issued to Gadi West, but no patent ever issued. Appellee deraigned title by mesne conveyance from West. The matter in controversy was the genuineness of the conveyance from West to one William C. Boone, which bears date July 5,1838, and was acknowledged July 25, 1852. This issue was submitted to the jury, and our conclusion is, that their finding in favor of its genuineness is supported by the evidence. It is undisputed that appellee had whatever title Boone acquired by that conveyance. Appellant’s first assignment of error complains of the charge of the court in submitting to the jury the question, whether this purported transfer of the certificate from West to Boone was executed by authority of West, because the evidence did not raise this issue; the contention being that the charge should have confined the inquiry to the question, whether West executed it, without also submitting whether it was done by his authority. There was testimony offered by appellants to the effect that West could neither read nor write. The issue was therefore raised, whether his name had been signed to the conveyance with or without his consent. It seems clear to us that this assignment is not well taken. The second assignment complains that there was error in allowing this conveyance to be read to the jury over the several objections made thereto by the defendants, as shown by their bill of exceptions number 1. No propositions or statements are submitted under this assignment, nor are we in any way informed by the briefs what these objections were. It appears therefrom that there were several of them. This assignment is therefore manifestly bad. The fourth assignment complains of the refusal of the court to give special instructions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Appellee objects to our considering the propositions submitted under this assignment, because it is not sufficiently specific. Under the well settled rules of practice, therefore, we are precluded from considering these propositions. The fifth and last assignment copied in the brief contains a series of objections to the verdict of the jury. We are of opinion that upon every issue raised in the case the verdict of the jury is supported by the evidence. It follows from these conclusions that the judgment must be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 2, 1893.","S. B. Burnett et al. v. E. Friedenhaus. No. 115. 1. Charge of Court—Evidence Held to Raise Issue.—Where plaintiff gave in evidence a transfer purporting to have been executed and signed by W.. and defendant offered testimony to the effect that W. could neither read nor write, an issue was thereby raised as to whether the instrument was executed by authority of W., and this question was therefore properly submitted by the court to the jury. 2. Practice on Appeal — Assignment of Error. — Where an assignment complains that the court erred in allowing a certain conveyance to be read to the jury S.*****11 over the several objections made thereto by the defendants, as shown by their bill of exceptions number 1,” and no propositions or statements are submitted under the assignment, and the briefs do not state what the objections were, such assignment is bad. 3.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Martha Storer, joined by her husband William Storer, brought this action in the District Court of Harrison County, August 1, 1889, against William H. Lane, Wade J. Lane, and Mrs. O. P. Gibbons and her husband C. R. Gibbons, as the heirs cf George Lane, deceased, to recover 2854 acres of land situated in Harrison County, being a part of the league and labor of land patented to Seth Sheldon as the assignee of Jose Arocha, by virtue of certificate 111 issued by Board Land Commissioners of Nacogdoches County. Plaintiffs in their petition alleged sole heirship of the said Martha Storer to the said Seth Sheldon, and that she was entitled to the land in her separate right. The petition set out the proceedings of the Probate Court of Harrison County in the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, by which the said George Lane became the purchaser of said certificate at administrator’s sale; averred that the said Lane was the attorney of the administrator of said estate, and became the purchaser of the certificate for a grossly inadequate price; that the proceedings under which said sale was had were void; and prayed for title and possessipn of the land as in trespass to try title, or that defendants be adjudged as trustees for the benefit of plaintiff Martha Storer; that the said administrator’s deed be set aside, and for writ of possession. Appellees presented a general demurrer to the petition, and specially excepted, because: 1. There was a collateral attack on the judgments, orders, and decrees of the Probate Court of Harrison-County. 2. The cause of action was a stale demand. 3. No fraud was alleged against Lane in the purchase of the certificate. 4. There was no proffer to return the purchase money. 5. It did not appear that the County and District Courts of Harrison County, in which the proceedings in the estate of Seth Sheldon were had, did not have jurisdiction over said estate. On March 21, 1891, defendants’ demurrers to the petition were heard, and the court overruled the exception as to stale demand, but sustained the general demurrer and special exceptions numbered 1, 3, 4, and 5; and the plaintiffs having declined to amend, the suit was dismissed. Both parties excepted to the rulings adverse to them. Plaintiffs alone have assigned error. The petition alleges, that on January 1, 1889, the plaintiff Martha Storer, in her separate right, was seized and possessed in fee simple of the land, fully described in the petition by metes and bounds; that said land was situated in the county of Harrison, and was patented on the — day of May, 1882, to Seth Sheldon, assignee of Jose Arocha, by patent No. 605, volume 23, by virtue of headlight certificate No. Ill, issued to Seth Sheldon, assignee of Jose Arocha, by Board of Land Commissioners of Nacogdoches County, February 1, 1838. That defendants unlawfully entered thereon, ejecting plaintiffs, and held possession thereof. It was averred also, that defendants’ possession was not actual. That the plaintiff Martha Storer was married to William Storer on the 3rd day of April, 1862, and that since that date she had always been a married woman and a resident of Canada; that she was the only daughter and sole heir of Seth Sheldon, and was entitled to the land sued for in her separate right as the heir of said Sheldon. That defendants’ pretended claim to said land grew out of a sale thereof made in the administration of the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased; that they claim as the heirs of one George Lane, who was an attorney at law. That letters of administration were first taken out in the County Court of Harrison County on said estate, in the year 1846, by one Chatfield; that in 1856, one T. A. Harris became the administrator thereof, and so continued until the day of his death, July 25, 1873, since which time there had been no administration of said estate, and no necessity for any; nor has any necessity existed for such administration since January 30, 1860, when the said Harris-filed in said estate (after disposing of all the property that had then come into his hands, and no property afterwards came into his hands) an itemized account, duly sworn to, showing that a balance of $438.36 remained in his hands, after payments of all debts, claims, and expenses. It was alleged further, that the said George Lane was the attorney for said estate from May, 1847, until November, 1871, and was cognizant of all the facts pleaded. That the said certificate had never been inventoried as the property of said estate, but on August 20, 1867, an application, sworn to, was filed for the sale of said certificate. Said application recited that the administrator was informed that his intestate had some claim to or interest in the said headlight certificate No. Ill; that he did not have, nor had he ever had, any papers showing what that interest was, or in any manner relating thereto; did not know the nature or extent of the interest; did not know where the certificate was, and had never seen it. He represented that all the debts of said estate had been fully paid off and discharged, except some that had been refused payment, and a portion of the expenses of administration which remained unpaid. That afterwards, on May 19, 1871, said Lane filed another application in said estate to sell said certificate; that- it referred to the application filed August 20, 1867, and made it a part thereof, and represented that the facts in said petition still existed; that an order of sale had been made, but no sale had ever been made thereunder; that the same cause existed for said sale, to-wit, the payment of a portion of the expenses of administration; and asked for a renewal of the previous order of sale; that no sufficient notice of said application for sale, or of the sale thereafter made, was given. It was further alleged; that the District Court of Harrison County, which then had jurisdiction of probate matters, made an order July 1, 1871, on said application, directing a sale of said certificate; and that a sale thereof was made on the first Tuesday in August, 1871; that when said sale was made, the said certificate was not in the possession of said Harris, but the said Lane had learned by correspondence through an agent, and knew that it was on file in the General Land Office at Austin, and bid in said certificate at said sale, for himself, at the sum of $300; that a sworn report of said sale was returned by said administrator September 26, 1871, and without a continuance thereof for one term, as required by law, the sale was confirmed by the court November 20, 1871, and on December 4, 1871, said administrator executed a deed to said Lane for the said certificate, which said deed was never recorded until May 19, 1882. That all of the papers in connection with said sale are in the handwriting of said Lane, and he represented the administrator therein; that the price at which said certificate was bought was grossly inadequate; that it was worth the sum of 85000. Plaintiffs averred, that by reason of the facts alleged the said sale was void, and that the title to said certificate never passed to the said Lane; .that said Lane died in 1885, and left the defendants as liis sole heirs, and that their claim is by inheritance from said Lane. That during bis life- • time the said Lane sold the remainder, to-wit, one-half, of said certificate, which was located on other lands, and was worth far more than the sum of 8300 pretended to have been paid by him for said certificate at said sale. That both said Lane and said Harris knew there was no necessity for the sale of said land, and that plaintiff Martha Storer was the heir. That after sale, on April 22, 1872, said Lane wrote a letter of inquiry to the children or relatives of Seth Sheldon, deceased, and admitted the claim of plaintiff to property in the said estate; that after sale no other action whatever was taken in said estate, and at the time thereof said certificate was the only property that belonged thereto. Plaintiffs prayed judgment as in trespass to try title, or that defendants be estopped from asserting any title to said land, or that defendants be constituted trustees for plaintiffs’ benefit, or that the title to said land be adjudged to be in plaintiffs and divested out of defendants; that any deed from the administrator to Lane be cancelled and held for naught; and that plaintiffs have the title and possession of said land, for writ of possession, costs, and such other and further relief as the case demanded. As a collateral attack upon the orders, judgments, and decrees of the Probate Court of Harrison County, made in the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, plaintiff Martha Storer could not maintain her suit. The recovery of the land in an action of trespass to try title would involve the nullity of the order of the court directing the sale of the land, and the decree of confirmation of the sale, and directing a deed to be executed by the administrator to the purchaser, Geo. W. Lane. At the time the application upon which the sale was ordered was made, the probate law of 1870 was in force, and it did not prescribe what the application should contain, as the law now in force does. Gillenwaters v. Scott, 62 Texas, 672. If we treat the sale as one of personal property, being a land certificate, there was not even the necessity of obtaining an order of sale. 2 Pasch. Dig., arts. 5629-5635. From the petition it appears that the administration of the estate had been pending for a number of years, and that a report filed by the administrator in 1860 showed a balance due the estate of 8438.36, after-payment of all the debts and expenses of administration; yet the application made for the sale of the land purported to be for the payment of the expenses of administration, and a purchaser need not look beyond the application and orders of qourt to ascertain whether or not the court had jurisdiction to make the order of sale. Property belonging to the estate may be sold for the payment of expenses of administration. If this was only an action of trespass to try title to recover the land sold in accordance with the application and orders in the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, we should hold that it was a collateral attack on the proceedings of the Probate Court of Harrison County, and that the court below did not err in sustaining the defendant’s demurrer. But it is also sought to set aside the deed executed by Harris as administrator of the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, to Geo. W. Lane, the ancestor of the defendants, in pursuance of proceedings in said estate, which, if had as alleged, were fraudulent. While fraud is not alleged eo nomine, still facts are alleged which would constitute fraud; and such being the case, it is unnecessary to charge the fraud as a conclusion. Plaintiffs alleged, that Lane was the attorney for the administrator of the estate; that in 1860 an account had been filed showing that the estate had been fully administered, and that there was a balance in the hands of the administrator; that in 1867 an application was made to sell the certificate to pay expenses of administration, which on its face discouraged bidders for the certificate by showing a want of knowledge as to its actual existence or ownership; that in 1871 this application was renewed and the certificate sold, while Lane in fact knew that the certificate was on file in the General Land Office, and was cognizant of all the facts with respect to the administration, and that no necessity existed for the sale of the certificate; that he bought the certificate at administrator’s sale for a grossly inadequate price, procured a confirmation of the sale, had a deed executed to himself, and afterwards, in 1882, procured a patent for the land; and not until then did he record his deed. No other proceedings were had in the estate after the account filed in 1860, except to sell the land certificate; and the papers in connection therewith were alleged to be in the handwriting of Lane. The administrator died in 1873, since which time there had been no administration. Unexplained, these allegations would show fraud on the part of the administrator and Lane in the proceedings resulting in the sale of the certificate. In McCampbell v. Durst, 73 Texas, 420, it was held, in a similar case, that it was a direct proceeding to vacate the deeds, which included the deed of the administrator of Burst’s estate, and that it might be done if the facts alleged were true, although the orders in probate stood. Without determining, however, whether the facts in this case would authorize the setting aside of the deed, we are clearly of the opinion that they are sufficient to charge the defendants as trustees of the legal title for the benefit of the plaintiff Martha Storer. Martin v. Robinson, 67 Texas, 369-381; Fisher v. Wood, 65 Texas, 204. As shown by the authorities cited, this does not violate the principle that the proceedings of a court of competent jurisdiction may not be collaterally attacked, for the proceedings leading to the sale and investing the purchaser of the land with the legal title may stand, and yet the holder of the legal title inajr be constituted a trustee for the benefit of the equitable owner. The facts alleged in the petition are sufficient to charge the defendants as trustees of the legal title for the benefit of plaintiff Martha Storer, and the defendant’s demurrer should have been overruled, unless it appears from the petition that the demand is stale. The court below overruled the defendants’ exception setting up stale demand, and there is no cross-appeal; but if the judgment can be sustained on that ground we are not concluded from a consideration thereof, because the court below did not consider that it presented a defense, especially since under our practice this defense may be raised by a general demurrer, as seems to have been done in Smith v. Hampton, 13 Texas, 459. At the time of the proceedings in the estate of Seth Sheldon, deceased, which resulted in the sale of the land certificate, the plaintiff was, and continued to be up to the time of the institution of this suit, a married woman. She was married to her coplaintiff in 1862. Lane’s deed for the certificate was executed in December, 1871. It does not appear when the land was located, but it was patented in May, 1882, and the deed from the administrator to Lane was recorded in 1882. Prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes in 1879, there was no law fixing a period of limitation to an action of this character; and when the defense of stale demand was invoked it was usual to apply the longest period of limitation by analogy to the statute, to determine when the demand would become stale. If it should be granted that there are no circumstances shown in the petition as an excuse why the plea of stale demand should not be invoked, and that equity would not follow the law in excepting a married woman from the application of the principle, yet less than ten years had elapsed when the Revised Statutes were put in force. By the Revised Statutes the indefinite equitable defense of stale demand was eliminated from the body of our law, and instead of meeting such a plea now with excuses, it should be met with legal exceptions, as, for example, coverture or infancy. Article 3207 of the Revised Statutes is: “Every action other than for the recovery of real estate, for which no limitation is otherwise prescribed, shall be brought within four years next after the right to bring the same shall have accrued, and not afterward.” This article includes the plaintiffs’ cause of action. Stale demand had not run against Mrs. Storer when this law took effect. It provided a"" law of limitation, instead of the equitable stale demand, which is met by the fact that the plaintiff Martha Storer is a married woman, and the statute was never set in operation against her. Delivered November 17, 1892. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to tender back the $300 purchase money bid by Lane for the land certificate, for the double reason that the purchase appeared to be fraudulent, and he had already disposed of and conveyed more of the land in value than the amount of the bid. The court erred in sustaining the demurrers of the defendants, because the plaintiffs’ petition showed a good cause of action, and the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","Martha Storer and Husband v. W. H. Lane et al. No. 26. 1. Probate Judgments — Collateral Attack. —The orders of a court having jurisdiction of an estate, made in 1871, directing a sale of certain property of the estate, and after sale confirming the same as reported, can not be attacked collaterally on the ground that there was no necessity for the sale, and no debts of the estate unpaid, nor because the order of confirmation was made at the same term of court at which the report was made, without a continuance thereof for one term, as required by law. The law then in force did not prescribe what the application for sale should contain, as it now does. 2. Probate Sale — Purchaser’s Title. — Although by a previous report of the administrator there appeared to be a balance due the estate of $488.36, after the payment of all debts and expenses of administration, yet the application made for the sale of the land purported to be for the payment of expenses of administration, and a purchaser need not look beyond the application and decrees of court to ascertain whether or not the court had jurisdiction to order the sale, and such sale can not be collaterally attacked in a suit of trespass to try title. 3. Allegations of Fraud. — When facts are alleged which would constitute fraud, it is unnecessary to charge fraud as a conclusion. 4. Same — Direct Proceeding to Vacate Deed. — Plaintiff alleged, that Lane was the attorney for the administrator; that an account filed in 1860 showed the estate to be fully administered and a balance of money on hand; that in 1867 an application was made to sell the land certificate to-pay expenses of administration, which on its face discouraged bidders by showing a want of knowledge of its actual ownership; that Lane, in whose handwriting were all the papers, in fact knew that the certificate was on file in the Land Office, and was cognizant of all the facts with respect to the administration; and that no occasion existed for the sale of the certificate. He became the purchaser at a grossly inadequate price, hut did not record his deed until 1882. Unexplained, these allegations show fraud on the part of Lane and the administrator. The proceeding was a direct one to vacate the deed to Lane; and suit being against his heirs, general demurrer to the petition was erroneously sustained, although the orders in probate stand. 5. Trustee of the Legal Title. — We are clearly of the opinion that the facts alleged are sufficient to charge defendants as trustees of the legal title for the benefit of Martha Storer; and this does not violate the principle that proceedings of a court of competent jurisdiction may not he collateral!)' attacked; for the proceedings leading to the sale and investing the purchaser with the legal title may stand, and yet the holder of the legal title may be constituted a trustee for the benefit of the equitable owner. 6. Stale Demand. — Prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes, when the defense of stale demand was invoked it was usual to apply the longest period of limitation by analogy to the statute to determine when the demand would have become stale; but by the Revised Statutes the indefinite equitable defense of stale demand was eliminated from our law. and instead of meeting such a plea now with excuses it should be met with legal exceptions, as for example coverture, or infancy. Stale demand had not run against Mrs. Storer when the Revised Statutes took effect, and the plea is met by the fact that she has been a married woman since 1862. 7. Tender of Purchase Money. — Defendants demurred specially because plaintiff's did not tender back the purchase money paid for the certificate by their ancestor; but in this case it was unnecessary, because by the allegations of the petition the purchase appeared fraudulent, and Lane had already disposed of and conveyed more of the land in value than the amount of his bid.

Lane being the attorney of Sheldon’s estate, coupled with inadequacy of price, the failure to have the certificate inventoried, and Lane’s concealment of the whereabouts of the certificate from bidders at sale, or from the court at time of order of sale and confirmation, is such fraud as will entitle appellants to recover, or constitute Lane’s heirs trustees, or cancel their legal right.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. This suit was brought by appellant against A. N. Carter and Louis Bergstrom as partners under the firm name and style of A. N. Carter, seeking to recover judgment for the sum of $5216.91 on account of moneys loaned and advanced to said firm. Appellee Bergstrom by answer denied the partnership, and that he was not indebted to appellant. Judgment below was rendered in favor of appellant against Carter, and that it take nothing against appellee Bergstrom. From this judgment appellant prosecutes this appeal. The evidence shows that Carter and Bergstrom in September, 1881, entered into a copartnership for the purpose of dealing in hides, wool, and produce. The contract of partnership by its terms was to continue in effect for one year from the making thereof. In October, 1881, the account sued on was opened with appellant by Carter for the purpose of obtaining advances to be used in carrying on the business for the firm. Carter, it seems, was the business manager of the firm at Laredo, and continued to obtain money from the bank until in the spring of 1883, when the account sued on was closed. It appears from the evidence that at the time the account with appellant was opened Carter informed the officers of appellant’s bank that Bergstrom was a partner in the firm of A. N. Carter, and upon the faith of this information the advances were made. On the basis of this evidence, it is contended by appellant that at the beginning of the dealings between it and Carter, Bergstrom was actually a partner with Carter: and that credit was extended upon the faith that he was such partner; and although he may have ceased to be a partner after September, 1882 (the time when the contract of partnership terminated), he is liable to appellant, because it had no notice of the dissolution or of the contract of partnership until after the account was closed in 1883. Upon the other hand, it is contended by appellee Bergstrom that although he was a partner for one year from September, 1881, that at that time the firm was dissolved, and that he is not bound by the statements made by Carter during the year that he, Bergstrom, was a partner; that he was a secret or dormant partner of the firm, and being such, he was not required to give notice of his dissolution with the firm, and is not bound or liable to appellant. , Other issues may arise out of the evidence, but we deem it only important to notice that discussed. The seventh paragraph of the charge of the court is as follows: ‘ ‘ If, however, you believe from the evidence that said firm of ‘A. 1ST. Carter ’ ceased to exist on the 23d day of September, 1882, and that plaintiff had no knowledge directly or indirectly that Louisp Bergstrom continued as a partner of said firm of ‘A. 1ST. Carter;’ and if you believe further from the evidence that said Bergstrom did no act directly or indirectly to lead plaintiff or its agents to believe that said firm of ‘A. N. Carter ’ was continued, and that the plaintiff had his dealing with A. 3ST. Carter in his individual capacity, then and in that event the defendant Bergstrom is not liable for any dealings had between the plaintiff and the said A. N. Carter, so made with said Carter in his individual capacity.” This charge is assigned as error. When credit is extended to a firm upon the assumption that certain persons comprise the membership, and such assumption in point of fact is correct, the members of such firm are liable to the creditors for future dealings with the firm until notice of dissolution is given to the creditor. Under such state of facts the creditors will not be affected by a dissolution or change in the firm until notice be given or knowledge of such fact has been brought home to them, and the burden of proving such notice or knowledge rests upon the partner claiming such exemption. 17 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 1117, 1118; 2 Bates on Part., secs. 611, 612, 613. This rule of law does not apply to partners who are regarded in law as dormant or secret partners. For no credit is extended upon the faith of their membership, and they in retiring from the firm are not required to give notice of such fact. The uncontradicted evidence in the record is, that Carter notified the appellant at the time that the account was opened that Bergstrom was a partner of the firm. Such in fact was his relationship to the firm at that time. We think this information given to appellant is sufficient to make Bergstrom known to appellant as a member, of the firm, and as to appellant he can not claim that he was a dormant partner. If it be true that Bergstrom was a member of the firm at the time appellant received information of that fact, it makes no difference from what source received; the effect is to make his connection with the firm known to appellant, and as to it he can not claim that he is a dormant partner. 1 Bates on Part., secs. 151, 153; 2 Bates on Part., secs. 608, 609-623; 17 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 1119-1123. Delivered October 19, 1892. Under these rules of law it was error to give the charge complained of, and for this reason we reverse and remand the case. We find no error presented in appellee’s cross-assignment of errors except that which relates to the admission in evidence of the books showing the account sued upon. We are not prepared to say that the copy of the account falls within any of the exceptions to the general rule that requires the production of the books of original entry, but we apprehend that this question will not arise upon another trial, because the books will probably be produced. Judgment reversed and cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","Milmo National Bank v. Louis Bergstrom. No. 2. 1. Liability of Retiring Partner — Secret Partner.— Ordinarily the creditors will not be affected by a dissolution or change in a debtor firm until notice be given or knowledge of such fact has been brought home to them, and the burden of proving such notice or knowledge rests upon the retiring partner claiming exemption from liability for the debts of the firm incurred subsequent to his retirement. This rule does not apply to dormant or secret partners. 2. Dormant or Secret Partner. — While a firm was in existence a creditor was notified by the active member of the name of his secret partner. The creditor, upon the solvency of the secret partner, opened an account with the firm, which account was kept up after the dissolution. In such case the secret partner can not claim to have been a dormant partner against such creditor, and he is liable to such creditor for debts subsequently incurred in name of the firm before the creditor had notice of its dissolution, or of the retirement of such member. Appeal from Bexar. Tried below before the Hon. G-. H. Noonan. J. O. Nicholson, S. M. Ellis, and W. W. Herron, for appellant. 1. Where a change takes place in a firm by a member retiring, and where the same firm name is still used, such retiring member can only relieve himself from liability by giving actual notice of such fact to former creditors who continue to deal with the firm. As to them the partnership is presumed to continue the same as it was when they commenced to deal with it until they in some way have actual notice a change has taken place. Davis v. Willis, 47 Texas, 154; Lansing v. Game, 2 Johns, 300; Groves v. Merry, 6 Cow., 701; Vernon v. Manhattan Co., 17 Wend.; 524; Id., 22 Wend., 183; Bank v. Norton, 1 Hill, 572; Prentiss v.

In order for Bergstrom to relieve himself of liability, it was necessary for him to so conduct himself or do some act after the twenty-third day of September, 1883, as would impress or notify the plaintiff that he was no longer a member of the firm of A. N. Carter. C. Upson, for appellee. 1. A dormant partner who was not known to be such, and who has not held himself out as a partner to the creditors of the partnership, is not bound to give notice of his retirement from the firm, and upon such retirement does not become liable for any debts contracted by the firm of which he was a dormant partner, although the name or style of such firm is not changed.

All payments made by the firm after his retirement, when the account is continued with the creditors in a running account, and no application of the payments on such account is made, must be applied to liquidate the oldest items of the account first.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. W. B. Page brought suit, in the District Court of Houston County, against N. E. Albright, and caused an attachment to be issued and levied on a certain stock of goods and lands belonging to the defendant. Similar suits were brought by John Albright and others. The goods were sold, as perishable property, by order of the district judge, made in chambers in the suit of W. B. Page, and the proceeds were paid in the registry of the court. This appeal is from the judgment of the court below sustaining a general demurrer to the petition in intervention of appellants, as junior attaching creditors of said N. E. Albright, to set aside the attachments of Page and others, and establish the prior right of the intervenors to páyment out of said attached property and its proceeds. John Albright and others were made parties to the intervention, and all proper parties were before the court. The only error assigned is to the action of the court in sustaining the general demurrer to the petition in intervention. Special exceptions were filed, as well as a general demurrer, but in rendering judgment the court ignored the special exceptions and sustained the general demurrer. Appellants’ petition in intervention substantially set forth, that they were creditors respectively of N. E. Albright, and that they had levied their respective attachments on the stock of goods in question, and had their attachment lien foreclosed and judgment rendered upon their debts, but prior thereto the said W. B. Page and John Albright had attachments levied on the same stock of goods and the goods had been sold, and the money was now in the custody'of the court; and praying that they be paid in preference of the said W. B. Page and John Albright, because, as they alleged, the said W. B. Page and John Albright did collude with, and arrange, agree, and combine with, the defendant N. E. Albright to the effect and with the understanding that the said defendant N. E. Al-bright would consent, and he did consent and agree, that the said W. B. Page and John Albright might levy their said attachments upon his said stock of goods and all other property of his that was subject to execution, with the intent to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of N. E. Al-bright, and especially the complainants, who were then, and for some time before had been, bona ñde creditors of the said N. E. Albright. ' It was further shown, that the ground alleged in the suits for attachments by the said W. B. Page and John Albright was that the said N. E. Al-bright “is about to convert a part of his property into money for the purpose of placing it beyond the reach of his creditors,” and complainants averred that the ground so alleged for attachment was not true in fact, and therefore there was no cause for the said attachments by the said W. B. Page and John Albright; and it was further averred, that the said W. B. Page claimed and asserted in his behalf a mortgage from the said N. E. Albright upon land as security for his said debt, in whole or in part, and the said security was sufficient to satisfy his said debt, or a large part thereof, and that the levy of the said attachment by him was in excess of any just demands he had against the said N. E. Albright, and consented to by the said N. E. Albright, as aforesaid, was in law and fact a voluntary disposition of his property in fraud of his other creditors; that at the time of the levy of the said attachments by the said W. B. Page and John Albright, the said N. E. Albright was largely in debt, and by reason of the said attachments and levies all of the defendant’s property was seized and disposed of, so far as same could be reached by execution; and that the said N. E. Albright, about the same time, transferred, assigned, and made over to Earle Adams, of the firm of Adams & Adams, all the notes and accounts belonging to him, and other property, and the said Adams is and was the attorney for the said W. B. Page and said John Albright in their said suits against the said N. E. Albright; and that the said goods sold under the order of this court were bought in by the said Earle Adams, Esq., and his son, Joe Adams, who were associated together in the practice of law as partners, and the goods thereafter returned to the possession of the said N. E. Albright, who is now in possession and full control ""of same, selling, using, and disposing of the same according to his pleasure; all of which, it was alleged, was arranged and contrived as a part of the plan by which the said goods should be placed beyond the reach of creditors of the said N. E. Albright. It was alleged that all of said writs have been levied upon certain lands belonging to the defendant N. E. Albright, and appellants prayed that they be subjected to priority in favor of their writ. We think that the petition is good on general demurrer. It is alleged that the attachment was the result of a collusive agreement between the plaintiff John Albright and the defendant; and that it was made with the intent to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of the defendant, and especially the complainants, who were then, and for some time before had been, bona fide creditors of the said N. E. Albright. Rev. Stats., art. 2465. As stated in Johnson v. Heidenheimer, 65 Texas, 263, “a fraudulent diversion of a debtor’s property may be as effectively, and is as frequently, accomplished by a collusive suit as by a direct transfer,* and both means are denounced by the statute in -the same terms.’ ’ It is true that it is not alleged that the claims of Page and John Albright were fictitious, but the attachments would also be invalid, either because they were suffered or procured to be made for the use and benefit of the defendant, or that they were contrived between the parties with the intent to hinder, defraud, or delay the other creditors of the said N. E. Albright. Claflin v. Sylvester, 12 S. W. Rep., 508. Both of these grounds appear to have been substantially alleged; sufficiently so, at least, to be good on general demurrer. Delivered December 8, 1892. For the error of the court below in sustaining the demurrer of appellees, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Justice Williams did not sit in this case.","Martin Clothing Company et al. v. W. B. Page et al. No. 49. 1. Intervention — Fraudulent Attachments. — Intervenors were junior attaching creditors of N. E. Albright, and sought to have prior attachments set aside, and to obtain priority of payment of their claim, upon the ground that the debtor had colluded with the prior attaching creditors, and consented to the issuance and levy of their attachments with intent to hinder, delay, and defraud his other creditors. There was further allegation that the grounds alleged for the prior attachments were not true, that one of the prior debts was amply secured by mortgage on realty, and that upon the sale of the goods attached, as perishable, the attorney for the prior attaching creditors had bought them in, and thereafter returned them to the possession of the debtor; all of which was alleged to be part of a plan by which the goods were to be placed beyond the reach of creditors. The petition was held good against a general demurrer. 2. Same. — A fraudulent diversion of a debtor’s property is as frequently accomplished by a collusive suit as by a direct transfer, and both means are denounced by the statute in the same terms. It is true that in this case the claims of the prior attaching creditors are not alleged to be fictitious, but if the attachments were suffered or procured to be made for the use and benefit of the debtor, or if they were contrived between the parties with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud other creditors, they would be invalid. • Appeal from Houston.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This is an action of trespass to try title, and for partition, instituted in the District Court of Haskell County by W. C. Ballard, A. C. Foster, Alice Tankersley and her husband Dock Tankersley, against H. C. Ford, T. W. Mays, J. E. Norton, and W. H. Campbell. . . There was a trial without a jury, which resulted in a judgment in favor of Ballard and Foster for an undivided interest of 483f acres of the land sued for, and in favor of Alice Tankersley and Dock Tankersley for an undivided interest of 400 acres, and in favor .of the defendants severally for the other portions of the land, except Campbell and Ford, who were adjudged to take nothing and to pay the costs of the suit. This judgment was agreed to by all the defendants except Ford, who prosecutes this writ of error. The court below filed no conclusions of law and fact, but there is a statement of facts in the record which shows that there is no controversy about the facts upon which the questions of law arise. The first assignment of error complains of the action of the court in overruling the application of plaintiff in error for a continuance. The application was made and sworn to by the attorney, and sought to continue the cause to procure the testimony of his client, plaintiff in error. Our conclusion is, that the application failed to show proper diligence, and that the testimony sought to be-obtained was not material, and that therefore the same was properly overruled. The second assignment complains of the admission in evidence of the deed from Mrs. N. L. Abbey to plaintiffs Ballard and Foster, which conveyed to them the entire tract of land in controversy, to-wit, the John Connor survey of 1744 acres, dated April 30, 1889; the- ground of objection being that this deed bore date subsequent to the date of the ouster, as alleged in the petition, and because it purported to be in lieu of a former deed, without the production of the deed in confirmation of which it purported to be made. The question here raised is decided adversely to plaintiff in error in Jenkins v. Adams, 71 Texas, 1. The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh assignments complain of the exclusion from the evidence, (1) of a deed from Mrs. Alice Tankersley to W. E. Rogers, dated May 24, 1873; (2) of a deed from W. E. Rogers to plaintiff in error, dated February 25, 1875, conveying 400 acres undivided interest in the land in controversy. These deeds were excluded on the ground that the husband of Alice Tankersley did not join her in the deed, it being alleged and proved by plaintiff in error that the land was her separate property at the date of said deed. • The record shows that both Rogers and Ford knew that said Alice Tankersley was a married woman; that Rogers made the trade with her husband with the knowledge and consent of his wife, and paid the principal part, if not all, the purchase money to the husband, except that portion .which, in the subsequent sale from Rogers to Ford, the latter agreed to pay and did pay to Dock Tankersley, the husband of Alice; and that this sale was acquiesced in by said Tanlcersleys for about fourteen years. The record contains no evidence of any concealment, misrepresentation, or other improper conduct on the part either of the husband or the wife, except as the bringing of this suit might be so construed. It must, therefore, be held that these deeds were properly excluded, the wife’s deed to her separate property without the joinder of her husband being a nullity. Cannon v. Boutwell, 53 Texas, 626; Peak v. Brinson, 71 Texas, 310; Etheridge v. Price, 73 Texas, 597; Johnson v. Bryan, 62 Texas, 623; Williams v. Ellingsworth, 75 Texas, 483. Delivered November 22, 1892. The remaining assignments complain of the judgment rendered. In so far as complaint is made of the decree of partition, the objections can not avail plaintiff in error; because, having been denied a recovery of any interest in the land (if the judgment' to that extent be valid), he would no longer have any interest in the partition proceedings. It is insisted that inasmuch as Mrs. N. L. Abbey conveyed, in the year 1871, to J. D. Abbey 1280 and to Jack Davis 320 acres of the land in controversy', an outstanding title would defeat any recovery by appellees. As these two undivided interests amounted tti 1600 acres, the entire tract containing 1744 acres, it follows that the subsequent deed from Mrs. Abbey to Foster and Ballard conveyed at least an undivided interest of 144 acres. This would be sufficient to enable them to recover the entire tract as against plaintiff in error. A deed made by said J. D. Abbey in the year 1873, to Alice Tankersley, conveying an undivided interest of 400 acres, was sufficient tó enable Tankersley and wife to maintain this suit in connection with their cotenants, Foster and Ballard, against plaintiff in error, who was in the attitude of a trespasser. It follows that the judgment must be affirmed. Affirmed. Chief Justice Tarlton disqualified and not sitting.","H. C. Ford v. W. C. Ballard et al. No. 37. 1. Trespass to Try Title-Deed Subsequent to Date of Ouster.— On the authority of Jenkins v. Adams, 71 Texas, 1, it is held not a tenable ground of objection to a deed offered in evidence by the plaintiff, and executed prior to the filing of the suit, that it bears date subsequent to the date of ouster as alleged in his petition, and purports to be a deed of confirmation, without the production of the deed it confirms. 2. Married Woman’s Deed — Joinder of Husband. — A deed for land the separate property of a married woman, executed by her without the joinder of her husband, no fraud or concealment having been practiced by her in the sale, is a nullity. 3. Outstanding Title — Cotenant’s Recovery Against Trespasser. Where an outstanding title does not cover the entire tract, but leaves an undivided interest in plaintiff, he is entitled to recover the entire tract as against a trespasser showing no title. Error from Haskell. Tried below before Hon. J. V. Cockrell. B. D. Tcirlton, for plaintiff in error. 1. The plaintiffs having alleged that they were owners in fee simple of the land sued for, on the lltli of February, 1887, the production of a deed to two of the plaintiffs, Foster and Ballard, dated April 30, 1887, does not support the allegation, and such deed is inadmissible, and should on objection have been excluded. Nor will the mere recital in the deed of April 30, 1887, that it was executed in lieu of another dated February 11, 1887, prove the execution or show the contents of such deed of February 11, 1887, so as to support the allegation referred to. Mims v. Mitchell, 1 Texas, 443; Denison v. League, 16 Texas, 400; Cotton v. Campbell, 3 Texas, 493. 2. While the deed to W. E. Rogers was not valid as a conveyance, on account of the absence of the husband’s signature, yet it having been shown that the same was executed by Mrs. Alice Tankersley, and that she and her husband received the purchase money, or the benefit thereof, the said instrument having been intended as a conveyance of the land, should have been admitted with other facts in this case as evidence of a contract upon which a conveyance would be enforced; especially should this be the case in the absence of an offer by Tankersley and wife to return the money which had been-paid them for the land. And such deed or instrument should, with the said other facts, have been admitted as evidence of an estoppel against Tankersley and his wife. Womack v. Womack, 8 Texas, 397; Dalton v.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On the 17th day of February, 1889, appellee’s mother delivered to appellant for transmission to him the following message: “ Bonham, Texas, Feb. 17. “ To F. E. Piner, Denton, Texas: “ Tour father is no better; come on first train. “ Sallie Finer.” This message was received at appellant’s office in Denton about 6:46 o’clock p. m. on the day of its date, but was not delivered to appellee until between 8 and 9 o’clock a. m. of the next day. Had the message been received by appellee on the 17th he would have reached his father about 7:15 a. m. on the 18th, but not having been delivered on that day, he was delayed in reaching his father until about 1 o’ clock p. m. of the 18tli. During the morning of the 18th appellee’s father was conscious, but became unconscious before appellee reached him, and never afterward regained consciousness. Appellee was, however, with his father for about two days before his death, and was present at his burial. For the mental anguish caused to appellee by his failure to reach his father before he became unconscious he brought this suit, and recovered a verdict and judgment in the sum of $4750. Appellant’s sixth assignment of error complains of the verdict and judgment as being excessive in amount, and we believe this assignment to be well taken. Appellee’s father was a man about 73 years of age, while appellee was himself about 50; and while the evidence in this case discloses an unusual degree of affection and confidence existing between father and son, we are constrained to hold, in the light of previous decisions by our Supreme Court, that $4750 is too large an amount to be allowed solely as compensation for the mental anguish caused by the failure of appellee to be with his father while conscious during the very short time of which he was deprived by the negligence of appellant. Tel. Co. v. Houghton, 82 Texas, 561; Tel. Co. v. Evans, supra, 297. Delivered November 1, 1892. We have examined the other assignments of error contained in appellant’s brief, and are of opinion there is nothing in any of them of which it can justly complain. Several of the questions therein presented have been disposed of in the case of Western Union ""Telegraph Company v. Evans, this day decided by us, and cited above. Let the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded.","Western Union Telegraph Company v. F. E. Piner. No. 22.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. In 1883, upon an inquisition of lunacy, duly instituted therein, the County Court of Grimes County adjudged William Berryman to be a lunatic, and by an order duly entered upon its minutes appointed one W. H. Gussett guardian of the person and estate of the lunatic. From this judgment Berryman appealed to the District Court, and executed a bond in accordance with the provisions of the statute, and thereby suspended the operation of the judgment, and prevented the said Gussett from qualifying as guardian. In June, 1887, appellant purchased from Berryman a tract of 250 acres of land situated in Grimes County. By the terms of the sale, the appellant agreed and promised to improve the land and reside upon it, and the vendor, the said Berryman, was to reside with him, and was to be maintained and comfortably supported by Grimes for the remainder of his life. Grimes took possession of the land, made improvements thereon, and Berryman became an inmate of his family. In April, 1888, the District Court of Grimes County, upon trial of the case appealed from the County Court, adjudged Berryman to be insane, and appointed appellee guardian of his person and estate; and as such guardian, appellee, on the 14th day of March, 1889, instituted this suit for the recovery of the land purchased as aforesaid by Grimes, and for cancellation of the deed of conveyance, and for rents. Appellee also caused a writ of sequestration to be levied upon the land, and the appellant replevied it. To the appellee’s suit appellant pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, pleaded also the general denial, and pleaded specially the sanity of his vendor, Berryman, averring that he never had been insane, and that he had capacity to contract at the time of the sale of the land to him; he pleaded also tenancy in good faith and the erection of valuable improvements upon the land, and that he had maintained and supported Berry-man until he was induced by the persuasion of the appellee to abandon the home of the appellant; and he charged that the writ of sequestration was maliciously sued out and levied upon the land in controversy by appellee, for the purpose of injuring and harassing him; and he pleaded in reconvention damages, resulting to him from the malice of appellee in levying the writ of sequestration upon his lands, and in alienating Berryman from him and destroying the friendly relations existing between them; and concluded with alternative prayer, that if the court should adjudge the sale of the land to appellant by Berryman to be invalid, that he might be allowed the value of his improvements, and that he be reimbursed out of the estate of Berryman for the expenses incurred in supporting him and in supplying him with proper medical treatment while an inmate of his family. The defendant’s pleas and answers, original, amended, and supplemental, and the exceptions to them, are so numerous, that we find it difficult to determine with certainty what were the issues which were finally presented and determined by the court; but as we read the transcript, exceptions were sustained to the defendant’s plea to the jurisdiction, and to all of his answer except the general denial; and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff for the land and for the value of its use and occupation. One of the pleas to the jurisdiction was based upon the assumption that the judgment of the District Court declaring Berryman a lunatic, and appointing appellee his guardian, was void, as the judgment showed upon its face that it was rendered by consent of plaintiff and counsel representing Berryman, and without evidence; but the record does not sustain this assumption, and the judgment is not void, and we therefore conclude that the court did not err in sustaining exceptions to this plea. While from the statement of facts in evidence upon trial of this cause, it might be inferred that there was no trial had in the District Court, and that the court rendered judgment upon consent of parties, yet we can scarcely believe that the learned judge who pronounced that judgment would have adjudged a citizen insane, and placed him and his estate in the custody of another, except upon ample proof and after mature deliberation. Nor did the court err in sustaining exceptions to appellant’s plea to its jurisdiction, based upon the assumption that the court was not being held at the county seat. The controlling question presented by the assignments of error for our decision is, Did the court err in holding that the judgment of lunacy was conclusive against the appellant, and in refusing to permit him to show, if he could, that Berryman was sane and capable of contracting at the time of the purchase of the land in question ? There is, perhaps, no subject upon which mankind are more disposed to differ than that of the condition of the human mind; and a rule of law which would make a judgment of lunacy conclusive against the world would be fraught with danger and injustice to third parties. Our Supreme Court, in accord with the great weight of authority, has said, that a contract made with one who has been adjudged insane, and is under the control and custody of a guardian, duly appointed, is void. Elston v. Jasper, 45 Texas, 409. But in this case, the judgment of lunacy pronounced by the County Court was suspended by the appeal and the supersedeas bond, at the time of the purchase of the land by appellant, and at that time Berryman was without a guardian of either his person or his estate. And when such is the case, it seems a judgment in lunacy is only prima facie evidence against third persons. Black on Judg., 803, par. 802; 51 N. Y., 359; 18 Am. Dec., 417; 1 Greenl., sec. 550. This rule commends itself to our judgment, and especially when, as in this •case, the judgment in lunacy is retroactive. For this error of the trial court the case must be reversed, and the appellant permitted to show, if he can, that Berryman was not a lunatic, and had mental capacity to make sale of the lands. The burden of proof will be on appellant, and the judgment of lunacy will be prima facie evidence of the insanity of Berryman at the time of the sale. If, upon this issue, the decision be for appellee, the appellant, if by proper averments and proof he shows himself to be a tenant in good faith, may recover for valuable and permanent improvements made by him upon the land, the measure of his compensation being the enhanced value of the realty by reason of such improvements; and the appellee will be entitled to recover the rental value of the premises, denuded of the improvements. The appellant will be also entitled to recover for actual necessaries furnished Berryman, if the latter should be found to have been insane at the time of the sale. If the result Qf the trial be that Berryman was sane and capable to contract at the time of the sale to appellant, upon proof that the writ of sequestration was maliciously sued out and levied upon the land by appellee, with the intention and purpose to harass and injure appellant, the-latter should recover under his plea in reconvention such damages as the evidence may show were the proximate result of the levy of the writ; and exemplary damages also, if averred and claimed by the plea. We take occasion to say, that before another trial the parties should be required to replead. The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the cause remanded for retrial. Reversed and remanded., Delivered January 12, 1893.","Henry F. Grimes v. James M. Shaw. No. 70. 1. Lunacy Judgment, When not Void.—A judgment declaring the defendant of unsound mind, is not void because rendered by consent of plaintiff and counsel representing the lunatic. It can not be presumed therefrom that there was no trial, and no evidence, and that the court rendered judgment upon consent of parties. 2. Jurisdiction—Change of County Seat.—The court did not err in sustaining exceptions to the plea to its jurisdiction, based upon the assumption that the court was not legally held at the county seat. For facts see statement of the case. S. Judgment of Lunacy, How far Conclusive.—In 1883 the District Court on appeal adjudged B. to be a lunatic. B. sold the land in controvery while the appeal was pending in the District Court. JSeld, that while the original judgment was suspended by the appeal, it was only prima facie evidence of B.’s lunacy, and his vendee should be allowed to prove his sanity at the purchase. 4. Improvements in Good Faith. — Appellant having, by the terms of sale, agreed with B. to reside upon and improve the land purchased, if it shall be found that B. was a lunatic when he sold it, but appellant by proper averment and proof shows himself to be a tenant in good faith, he may recover for valuable and permanent improvements made thereon. 5. Necessaries Furnished Lunatic.—Appellant having, in the contract of sale, agreed to support B. comfortably, if B. was insane at the time of sale, will be entitled to recover for actual necessaries furnished him. 6. Damages for Wrongful Sequestration.—If B. was sane when the sale was made, upon proof that the sequestration was maliciously sued out with intent to harrass and injure appellant, he should recover such damages, under his plea in reconvention, as were the proximate result of the levy of the writ. Appeal from Grimes. Tried below before Hon. Norman G. Kittrell. The order adjudging Berryman of unsound mind is as follows: “ Grimes County v. William Berryman.—No. 2725.—April 9, A. D. 1888.—On this day this cause was called for trial. Then came the parties by their attorneys, and both parties announced ready for trial. Thereupon the defendant withdrew his answer heretofore filed. Then came a jury, to-wit, J. L. Gillespie and eleven others, who were duly sworn, and said jury, under charge of the court and by consent of counsel for the defendant, returned the following verdict: ‘ We, the jury, find the defendant to be of unsound mind. J. L. Gillespie, Foreman.’ “ It is therefore considered, adjudged, and decreed by the court, that the defendant, William Berryman, is of unsound mind.” The ground upon which it was claimed that Anderson was not the county seat was, that pending this suit an election had been held to fix the county seat, and Navasota had received more than two-thirds of the votes cast, but the county judge had illegally canvassed the votes and issued certificate of election to Anderson, and subsequently the county commissioners had legally canvassed the returns and issued certificate of election to Navasota. Preston & Spencer, for appellant. 1. The court erred in sustaining plaintiff s demurrer and exceptions to defendant’s plea to the jurisdiction of the court to try this cause at the town of Anderson, because said pleas show that Navasota is the county seat of said Grimes County.

"KEY, Associate Justice. The statement of facts in the record in this case discloses the nature of the litigation, which statement is as follows: “ The estate of Thomas Martin, who died in May, 1886, unmarried, was administered upon in the Probate Court of Bexar Count)-, Texas, and .7. F. Mullaly was duly appointed as administrator on January 23, 1889. “ The only property of Thomas Martin was his homestead, on which he lived at the time of his death and previous thereto, with his children,. one of whom was a minor, but without a wife, who had died long before. “ This homestead was sold in course of administration and a balance of §171.15 shown to be left in the hands of the administrator for distribution to the creditors. “ Two claims were presented against the estate and allowed by the administrator and approved by the court; and as the estate was not sufficient to pay off both these claims, hence arose this contention between the two claimants. “ One of the claims, that presented by James Raley, the appellee, was a promissory note given by Thomas Martin, the deceased, on May 15, 1884, payable six months after date and secured by a deed of trust on the homestead, on which Thomas Martin, deceased, resided at this time with his minor child and other children, but without a wife. “ On February 15, 1889, this claim was presented and allowed by the administrator for the full amount of §303. This claim was examined and approved as a fourth class claim by the probate judge on March 19, 1889, and ordered to be paid in due course of administration as a fourth class claim. “The other claim, that presented by Ben. Kiolbassa, appellant, was a judgment recovered by Ben. Kiolbassa in the Justice Court against Thomas Martin on March 13, 1883, on which judgment execution issued on April 17, 1883, and not thereafter; and the judgment not being satisfied, was then duly recorded so as to preserve a valid lien against any property that Thomas Martin might have subject to execution. “ This claim was presented and allowed by the administrator for the full amount of $157.36 on July 8, 1889. And this claim was further examined and approved by the county judge for the full amount as a just and true claim, and ordered to be paid in due course of administration as a claim of the third class. “ The administrator advertised for final settlement at a subsequent term of the County Court held on Monday, January 19, 1891; and Ben. Kiolbassa, the appellant, holding a third class claim against the estate-, made application, asking that the administrator pay over all the sum that may be in his hands, less costs of this court and administration, to satisfy this claim, being a third class claim, and therefore having a preferred right to other claims against this estate. “And also James Raley, the appellee, presented his fourth class claim, with deed of trust securing it, asking an order of distribution and that his claim might be paid. At the same time J. F. Mullaly, the administrator, came in and filed his report for final settlement, asking for its approval and an order of distribution. ‘ ‘At this hearing the County Court ordered the funds in the hands of the administrator to be paid in satisfaction of James Raley’s, the appellee’s, claim, to which ruling the creditor Ben. Kiolbassa excepted and gave due notice of appeal.” We adopt the above as conclusions of facts. The District Court sustained the action of the County Court, and rendered a similar judgment, from which this appeal is prosecuted. The assignments of error are as follows: “ 1. The court erred in holding that the order of the County Court ordering Kiolbassa’s claim to be paid in due course of administration as a third class claim was not final and conclusive; but that the claim can be reopened and reclassified at a subsequent term of the court. “ 2. The court erred in holding that the claim of James Raley was a secured claim and should be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the property belonging to the estate; because the facts show that this was the only property belonging to the estate, that the funds in the hands of the administrator were not sufficient to pay both Kiolbassa’s and Raley’s claims, and that the Kiolbassa claim was the only claim classed as a secured claim, or as a lien on the property of decedent. “ 3. The court erred in holding that the claim of James Raley should have priority of payment over the claim of Ben. Kiolbassa; because the facts show that Kiolbassa’s claim is a third class claim and Raley’s claim is a fourth class claim. “ 4. The court erred in holding that the deed of trust given to secure Raley’s note was a good and valid mortgage on the property of decedent, Thomas Martin; first, because the facts show that the only property belonging to decedent was his homestead, on which he lived with a minor child at the time the deed of trust was given; second, because the fapts show that at the time- the claim on the note was allowed by the administrator and approved by the Probate Court the note was barred by the statute of limitations.” So much of our statute classifying claims against estates of decedents as has application to this question reads as follows: “Article 2037. The claims against an estate shall be classed and have priority of payment as follows: üí -x- “3. Claims secured by mortgage or other liens, so far as the same can be paid out of the proceeds of the property subject to such mortgage or other lien; and when more than one mortgage or lien shall exist upon the Same property the oldest shall be first paid; but no preference shall be given to such claim secured by mortgage or lien further than regards the property subject to such mortgage or other lien.” Under this statute a claim against an estate may be a claim of the third class as to a portion of the property, because secured by a lien thereon, and of the fourth class as to the remainder of the estate. And if it be true, which we do not decide, that an order or judgment of a Probate Court declaring that a claim is secured by a lien on certain property, and is therefore a third class claim against the estate as to said property, is a final judgment and binding upon the owners of other claims against the estate, unless set aside or appealed from, still we do not think that appellant’s claim comes within that category. His claim was a judgment recorded in Bexar County, so as to create and preserve a lien on any real estate Thomas Martin owned in said county subject to forced sale. The Probate Court approved it and ordered it paid in due course of administration as a third class claim, but did not adjudge it to be a lien on Martin’s homestead or on any other property. We think that in ordering it to be paid as a third class claim the County Court never intended to declare this claim to be a lien on Martin’s homestead. It should not be construed to mean more than this: That if there was any of Martin’s estate to which appellant’s judgment lien would under the law attach, then, as to such property, this claim should have priority. We conclude that the first assignment of error is not well taken. Eastham v. Sallis & Ralston, 60 Texas, 576; Mortgage Co. v. Jackman, 77 Texas, 622. The second assignment involves substantially the same question that the first does, and need not be further considered. The third assignment, alleging that the court erred in according appellee’s claim priority over appellant’s, because the facts show that appellant’s is a third and appellee’s a fourth class claim, is not sustained by the facts. To have warranted the court below in classifying his claim as one of the third class as to the fund in controversy, he should have shown that the land the sale of which produced the fund was subject to forced sale, and therefore to his judgment lien at the time said judgment was recorded, or at any rate at the time Martin executed the trust deed to secure appellee’s debt. Appellant failed to make such showing, and this assignment of error is not well taken. As to the fourth assignment of error, it is settled that an unmarried surviving spouse can mortgage the homestead and that the courts can enforce such mortgage. As to the first of these propositions, see Lacy v. Rollins, 74 Texas, 566; Smith v. Von Hutton, 75 Texas, 626. As to the second proposition, see Harle v. Richards, 78 Texas, 80. As to appellant’s proposition based on the assumption that the land sold was community property, and that the purchaser acquired only a half-interest therein, it is enough to say that the purchaser paid his money for Martin’s interest in the land, and whether he got title to only one-half, all, or none is wholly immaterial in this case. Delivered October 19, 1892. Nor is there any merit in the contention that appellee’s claim was barfed by the statute of limitations when presented for allowance. The statute of limitations was suspended for one year after Martin’s death, and the claim was presented just four years and three months after its maturity. Rev. Stats., art. 3218. None of the assignments of error are well taken, and the judgment of the District Court is affirmed. Affirmed.","Ben. Kiolbassa v. James Raley. No. 390. 1. Approval of Recorded Judgment by Probate Court. — In approving a recorded judgment presented as a claim against an estate, and ordering it paid as a third class claim, the legal effect of such action is that if there was any property of the estate to which the lien would attach, then as to such property the order would apply; it would not apply to property (the homestead) to which a lien could not attach. 2. Homestead of Unmarried Head of Family. — It is settled that an unmarried surviving spouse can mortgage the homestead, and that the courts can enforce such mortgage. 3. Statute Construed — Classification of Claims. — Article 2037, section 3, construed, relating to classification of claims against estates. 4. Cases Adhered to. — Lacy v. Rollins, 74 Texas, 566; Smith v. Yon Hutton, 75 Texas, 620; and Harle v. Richards, 78 Texas, 80, adhered to. Appeal from Bexar. Tried below before Hon. W. W. King. Wurzbach & Goeth, for appellant. 1. The Probate Court has original exclusive jurisdiction to classify claims, and all orders made in the exercise of such jurisdiction are as final and conclusive as the judgments, decrees, or orders of any other court. Neill v. Hodge, 5 Texas, 489; Eccles v. Daniels, 16 Texas, 139; Swan v. House, 50 Texas, 653; Porter v. Sweeney, 61 Texas, 214; Sabrinos v. Chamberlain, 76 Texas, 629; Rev. Stats., arts. 2025, 2031, 2200; Roach v. Martin’s Lessee, 27 Am. Dec., 755. 2. Every judgment regularly entered must become final at the end of the term. Merle v. Andrews, 4 Texas, 211; Finley v. Carothers, 9 Texas. 517; Brownsville v. Basse, 43 Texas, 448; Freem. on Judg., sec. 96. 3. It is the duty of the probate judge when approving a claim to also classify the same, and to do this he must also ascertain whether or not the-claim is secured by lien or otherwise. Rev. Stats., arts. 2025, 2026; Graham v. Vining, 2 Texas, 443; Mortgage Co. v. Jackman, 77 Texas, 625, 626. 4. Secured claims are classed as claims of the third class. Rev. Stats., art. 2037; Buchanan v. Wagnon, 62 Texas, 378; Eastham v. Sallis, 60 Texas, 578. 5. A mortgage is a mere incident of the debt, and when action on the latter is barred by the statute of limitations there is no remedy in the courts to enforce the mortgage. Duty v. Graham, 12 Texas, 427; Fievel v. Zuber, 67 Texas, 279; Goldfrank, Frank & Co. v. Young, 64 Texas, 434; Perkins v. Sterne, 23 Texas, 561. 6. A claim against an estate secured by a mortgage or trust deed can not be enforced by sale after death of the debtor, but only through Probate Court. Jenkins v. Cain, 72 Texas, 91; Robertson v. Paul, 16 Texas, 472; Armstrong v. Moore, 59 Texas. 648; McCormick v. McNeel, 53 Texas, 15; Graham v. Vining, 2 Texas, 441; Graham v.Vining, 1 Texas, 643. James Raley, for appellee. Appellant argues that after a claim is classified it is then beyond the control of the court. But this court has decided otherwise. 60 Texas, 578. The language used is: “ The classification of the respective claims could not have the effect of precluding the Probate Court from making an inquiry as to the right of the one creditor to have priority of payment over the other out of the proceeds of the sale of property, even if they both had liens upon it.” The Kiolbassa claim, if not barred, was properly classed third as to any real estate Martin had, except his homestead; and Raley’s claim was fourth class as to everything except the land mortgaged. The classification is no part of the judgment. The allowance is a final judgment (article 2031), but the classification is provided in article 2037 and it has no such force. A claim may be third class as to some property and fourth class as to others. Art. 2037, subdiv. 3. This shows the wisdom of the rule that at final settlement, after all parties are notified and brought into court, the allowance of claims and their classification can be changed or set aside. It would be monstrous if strangers should be bound by the orders of the Probate Court allowing and classifying-claims. And all parties must be strangers except the administrator and the heirs."
"FISHER, Chief Justice. On the 13th day of January, 1887, J. H. Hill executed a deed of trust upon certain real and personal property, to secure certain notes due by him to the San Angelo National Bank. At the maturity of the indebtedness, the property was advertised and about to be sold, and to prevent this Hill applied to J. H. Glass, of San Antonio, Texas, for relief, and agreed to pay him a.commission of $150 for his services in connection with securing him the loan, and further agreed that this additional sum due as commissions should be secured as the other indebtedness, and paid out of the proceeds of the sale under the deed of trust. The notes were transferred to Glass, and extended for Hill’s accommodation. Subsequently a substituted trustee, Hill again defaulting in payment, advertised the property under the deed of trust, and sold it. The cash was paid for the personal property, but P. J. Willis, who bought the real estate, failed to pay for it at the time. This sale occurred September 27, 1887. Thereafter, this real estate was again advertised to be sold on the 18th day of October, 1887, but before the sale Willis paid the purchase money for a part of the land bought by him at the first sale, and the remainder, which is the land in controversy, was again sold and purchased by Frank Lerch, one of the defendants. In the original petition filed by J. H. Hill November 11, 1887, he made P. J. Willis and Frank Lerch defendants, and sought to set aside the two sales referred to above; and for grounds of vacating the first, of date September 27, alleged, that he was unable to attend on account of sickness, but before it was made he caused a tender to be made of all moneys due, including the costs, and that the property was not advertised a sufficient length of time under the deed of trust, and for these reasons the sale was void. The second sale, of date October 18, was also attacked, on the grounds that it was not sufficiently advertised, and because, as alleged, the proceeds of the first sale had satisfied all demands against the property. Thus the case stood, with J. H. Hill as plaintiff and the said P. J. Willis and Frank Lerch as defendants, until November 16, 1888, when D. H. and J. W. Snyder filed what is styled their petition of intervention, in which they make no complaint againt P. J. Willis, but sue Frank Lerch, and join therein Otto Lerch as a defendant. In this plea of intervention the original sale, of date September 27, is treated and considered as valid and regular in all respects, but they attacked the second sale as void ab initia upon two grounds: (1) That the sale was not advertised the requisite length of time under the deed of trust. (2) The first sale satisfied the debt secured by the deed of trust and the cost and expenses. These intervenors set out as the basis of their right to intervene, that the original plaintiff, J. H. Hill, had executed a certain instrument to one of them, John W. Snyder, whereby these lands, with others, were conveyed to said Snyder to secure said intervenors in certain indebtedness due them by said Hill, and to indemnify them for certain liabilities incurred by them for said Hill. Said instrument is set out in full as an exhibit to said petition of intervenors. The defendants Frank and Otto Lerch interposed their demurrers, general and special, to the original petition of Hill and the petition of intervention of D. H. and J. W. Snyder, which were overruled and exceptions taken; and also pleaded that the original sale of September 27 was properly advertised, and did not satisfy the deed of trust, expenses, costs, etc., and the second sale was in all respects regular and valid, and passed the title. Also, that the defendants were innocent purchasers of the land for a valuable consideration, without notice of any irregularities and defects, if there were any, etc. On the day of trial the Park Land and Cattle Company intervened and claimed the land, adopting the pleadings of the Snyders. The motion to strike out this plea was overruled, and at the instance of the intervenors the case was dismissed as to the original plaintiff, Hill, and on the trial of the cause before the court without a jury, judgment was rendered in favor of the intervenors'Snyder and the Park Land and Cattle Company, jointly, against the defendants Frank and Otto Lercli, cancelling their deeds and giving judgment against them for the land and costs. 1. All the parties to the suit deraigned title from J. H. Hill as common source. 2. The appellees, D. H. and J. W. Snyder and the Park Land and Cattle Company, hold under a certain instrument executed by J. H. Hill,, which is as follows: “The State of Texas, County of Tom Green.—Know all men by these presents, that I, J. H. Hill, for and in consideration of the sum of $10, cash in hand to me paid by John W. Snyder, of Williamson County, Texas, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, have granted, bargained,, sold, and conveyed, and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell, and convey unto him, the said John W. Snyder, the following tracts or parcels of land, to-wit. [Description of land omitted.] “ To have and to hold, unto him, the said John W. Snyder, his heirs and assigns forever, in trust nevertheless, for the following purposes, to-wit: “First. Whereas, D. H. and J. W. Snyder, of Georgetown, Texas, are my sureties on a certain note given by me to Mrs. E. H. Mitchell, of' Travis County, during the month of February, 1886, on, to-wit, the 22d of said month, the same being for a large amount of money, to-wit, the sum of $10,268; and whereas, the said D. H. and J. W. Snyder have-already advanced and paid for my benefit on said note the sum of $5000, and are held and firmly bound for the payment of the balance thereof, the said note referred to being the last note given by me to said Mrs. Mitchell, with said parties as sureties; now therefore, this conveyance made to indemnify and secure the said D. H. and J. W. Snyder against loss as far as may be done. And the said J. W. Snyder, as trustee hereunder, is fully authorized. to take possession of and control of the said lands; to sell the same at public or private sale for cash or on time, or for part cash and part on time, for such sums and in such manner as he may see fit; to do any and everything with regard thereto as if his own individual property; to make good and warranty deeds thereto,.save as-against the purchase money notes now outstanding against the same. “ The proceeds of which sale or sales are to be applied as follows, to-wit: If said sales shall be made by the purchaser or purchasers assuming the amounts due on the purchase money notes due on said portions and giving an advance or additional sum for said land, then the advance shall be applied to the reasonable cost and expense of administering this trust, and the balance to repayment of said D. H. and J. W. Snyder the money already advanced by them for me; and if that shall have been fully refunded, then to the discharge of the remainder due on said note to Mrs. E. H. Mitchell. It being fully understood and agreed, that if it shall be deemed best by said John W. Snyder so to do, he shall have the right to sell a portion of said land and apply the proceeds to clearing the balance from all vendor’s liens and encumbrances now existing thereon, and so to use and convey the portion thus cleared so as to best answer and subserve the purposes of this trust deed, which is the indemnifying and securing the said D. H. and J. W. Snyder. “ The surplus of the proceeds of said land, if any, after fully indemnifying said parties against loss and paying reasonable expenses of this trust, are to be paid over to me or my representatives. “ In testimony whereof, I hereunto sign my name, this the 4th day of October, 1887. [Signed] "" “ J. H. Hill.” 8. The appellee the Park Land and Cattle Company holds under a deed executed by the Snyders by virtue of this instrument. 4. The appellants hold under a sale made by virtue of a deed of trust executed by J. H. Hill for the benefit of J. H. Glass, the purchase made on the 18th day of October, 1887. 5. The deed of trust under which appellants hold required the property to be sold after giving ten days notice of the time, place, and terms, and description of the property to be sold, by printed advertisements in some newspaper published in Tom Green County, once a week for at least two successive weeks prior to the day of sale. 6. The land was sold to appellants on the 18th of October, 1887, under this deed of trust. 7. The notice of the sale required to be given was first published in the San Angelo Standard, a weekly newspaper published in San Angelo, Tom Green County, on October 8, 1887. 8. The sale was made as above stated, less than ten days after the advertisement was first published. For this reason, we find as a fact that the sale was void, and conferred no title upon appellants. Several assignments of errors are presented by appellants, but we only notice those that we deem important. It is contended by appellants, that the instrument under which the appellees assert title, as executed by J. H. Hill to D. H. and J. W. Snyder, is simply a deed of trust or mortgage, with power of sale, and does not confer upon the Snyders such interest in the land as would permit them to maintain this action. We think the deed of trust is broad enough in its terms to confer upon the Snyders the authority to make the transfer of the property to the intervenor the Park Land and Cattle Company, and in permitting them to remove cloud from the title and to cancel sales affecting the title, as could have been done by Hill himself, if he had insisted upon his rights in this case. The instrument authorizes the Snyders to take full possession and control of the lands; to sell the same at public or private sale, for cash or on time, and for such sums and in such manner as they may see fit; to do any and everything with regard thereto as if his own individual property; to make good and warranty deeds thereto. In accomplishing these purposes, Snyder had the right, in order to put him in a position to do the very acts and to perform the powers conferred upon him by the instrument, to have cancelled and set aside any adverse title that may have been a hindrance in the performance of these duties. The second question presented by appellants is, that it does not appear from the pleadings or from the evidence that a tender was made by the appellees of the amount of purchase money paid by appellants at the trustee’s sale under which they hold. Reimbursing the appellants was not a duty required of the appellees as a predicate to maintaining this action and in obtaining the relief granted by the trial court. The sale made by the trustee was absolutely void. The Snyders had no interest in that matter, excepting so far as that sale may have been a cloud upon their title. Their interest was adverse to that of appellants, or that of any one else which tended to affect the title asserted by the Snyders. No obligation was resting upon the Snyders’, as a prerequisite to the right of attacking this adverse title, that they should discharge any claim that the appellants might have against J. H. Hill or Glass, to recover from them the price that the)r had paid for property of which they received no title. The third question presented is, was the sale to appellants under the deed of trust under which they claim void ? The deed of trust required the land to be sold after advertisement of ten days in some newspaper published in Tom Green County. The evidence shows, that the first publication was made on the 8th of October, 1887, and the sale was made on the 18th of October, 1887. It is apparent from this statement that the sale was not advertised for the length of time required b)1- the terms of the deed of trust. The requirement of the law on the question of time, as shown by the facts of this case, is ten full days. The sale made upon the 18th would not be ten full days, because the day upon which the advertisement is first published is to be excluded in computing the time when the publication begins. The court below held the sale void for this reason, and also for the further reason that the debts secured by the deed of trust under which appellants claim had previously been paid and satisfied. Holding as we do, that the sale was void because not advertised for the length of time required by the deed of trust, it is not necessary for us to pass upon the other reason given the court below for holding the sale void. The judgment of the court below is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 8, 1893.","Frank Lerch and Otto Lerch v. D. H. and J. W. Snyder. No. 81. 1. Trust Deed—Construction—Trustee may Sue to Remove Cloud Upon Title.—A debtor conveyed lands to one of his creditors with power to the trustee and another beneficiary in the trust to take possession of the land, remove clouds upon title, and sell part or all at such prices as to them seemed best. Held, that the beneficiaries had power to sell, and to institute proceedings in their own names to remove clouds from the title to the lands. 2. Void Sale—Return of Purchase Money.—Under an older deed of trust for the same land sale was made, but without advertising the sale for the time prescribed in the deed of trust. The junior trustee and beneficiary, in suing to remove the cloud upon the land by reason of the void sale, were not required to tender the amount of the purchase money paid at such sale. 3. Void Sale—Time Computed.—A trustee required to advertise ten days before sale, made publication first on October 8. He sold on the 18th of same month. Held, his sale was void, and passed no title to the land. Appeal from Tom Green. Tried below before Hon. J. W. Timmins. Lerch & Wallace and H. G. Robertson, for appellants. 1. Only persons having a legal title and right of possession can maintain a suit like this; and J. H. Hill being the only party so situated in this case, when the suit was dismissed as to him on the trial, it should have failed as to intervenors also. 2. D. H. Snyder not being a party to the instrument under which he claims the right to intervene in this case, and such instrument conferring no right upon him to sue, he was an improper party, and the demurrer on that account should have been sustained. 3. The court erred in overruling the special exception to said plea of intervention, because the same did not tender or offer to pay back the money which defendants had paid in the purchase of said lands at said sale under said deed of trust. 4. Waiving the consideration of the partial publication of the 7th of October by the mailing and partial distribution of the paper on Friday night of the 7th, and treating the publication as of the 8th of October, the sale on the 18th of October was proper, and the ten days contemplated in the deed of trust complete. The rule is, to exclude either the day of publication or the day of sale, and to include the other in computation. Grisseth v. Bogert, 18 How., 158; Wade on Notice, secs. 1070, 1071, et seq., 1101, 1102; Jones on Mort., sec. 1838; Comyn’s Dig., 397. R. H. Ward, for appellees. The sale on October 18, 1887, by J. M.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. This suit was instituted in the District Court of Bexar County, by appellee, against appellant, to recover damages for she alleged negligence' of appellant in running an engine operated by its servants against him while he was attempting to cross the railway at a crossing, thereby severely and permanently injuring him. Defendant answered by general denial, and that appellee was guilty of contributory negligence. Verdict and judgment were in favor of appellee for $7250. The second error assigned is as follows: “ The plaintiff having testified that his statement on this trial was different from his statement on the former trials of this case as to the distance the train was from him when he first saw it, and having in answer to the question, 1 Have you read the opinion of the Supreme Court reversing this case ?’ said, ‘ Yes, I have,’ the court erred in not permitting defendant’s counsel to ask the plaintiff the following question: ‘ Have you not made a different statement in your testimony on this trial as to the distance the train was from you when you first saw it, from the statements you made in your testimony on the former trials of this case, by reason of the Supreme Court having reversed the case and you having seen the grounds upon which the case was reversed ?’ because said question was legitimate for the purpose of showing plaintiff’s motive in making such different statements, and thereby to discredit his testimony.” The former opinion of the Supreme Court in this case reversed and remanded the case for the reason that it appeared from the facts, as then shown, that the appellee was guilty of contributory negligence in not getting off the railway track before he was hit by the locomotive, it appearing that he saw the approach of the engine, and that at such time it was such a distance from him as would have enabled him to leave the track before it reached him, and his failure so to do constituted negligence upon his part. The testimony of the appellee in the present case upon this point tended to show, that the locomotive was much nearer to him when he first observed it than testified to in the former trial; and that the locomotive being so near and coming with such speed, he did not have time, by the use of diligence, to leave the track before he was struck. If it be true that the appellee was induced to make this change in his evidence, and to testify upon the second trial differently from what he had testified to on the former trial, about a matter of such importance, by reason of the decision of the Supreme Court referred to, then we believe it was permissible for appellant to prove the fact. The effect of such evidence would be to show the motive of appellee in changing his evidence to be that he was not guilty of the act denounced by the Supreme Court as fatal to his right- of recovery. And it would be a legitimate inference that the jury might consider with other facts in the case that his purpose in testifying differently was to make a case that would meet the objections of the decision rendered in reversing the former judgment. It would be also admissible as a fact or circumstance tending to discredit the appellee, to be considered by the jury for what it may be worth. We think the evidence was admissible. Delivered December 21, 1892. There is no merit in the remaining assignments of error. The facts of this case are in several essentials different from those developed in the former trial, and we can not say that the evidence shows that appellee was guilty of contributory negligence, and will not disturb the verdict for this reason. As to the°point that the verdict is excessive, that has been settled adversely to the contention of appellant by the judgment of the Supreme - Court in the first appeal of this case. 72 Texas, 344. For the error in refusing to permit appellant’s counsel to ask the appellee the question as heretofore stated, upon the trial, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause. Reversed and remanded.","Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company v. Charles Porfert. No. 55. 1. Cross-Examination of Witness. — A plaintiff testified for himself upon a second trial in an action for personal injuries inflicted by a train running upon him when driving a wagon and crossing the track. He made a materially different statement from that made on the former trial as to the distance the train was from the crossing when he noticed its approach. On cross-examination it was reversible error to refuse the following question: “ Have you not made a different statement in your testimony on this trial as to the distance the train was from you when you first saw it, from the statements you made in your testimony on the former trials of this case, by reason of the Supreme Court having reversed the case and you having seen the grounds upon which the case was reversed ?” The witness had admitted having read the opinion of the Supreme Court holding him guilty of contributory negligence upon his own testimony as to the distance the train was from him when he saw it. 2. Verdict — Personal Injuries. — In a railway collision plaintiff had his leg broken, thigh and ankle injured, was confined from injuries eleven months in hospital, crutches were necessary for a year longer, and permanent lameness remained. Held, a verdict for $7250 is not excessive. Appeal from Bexar. Tried below before Hon. G. H. Noonan. Upson & Bergstrom, for appellant. 1. The plaintiff having testified that his statement on this trial was different from his statement on the former trials of this case as to the distance the train was from him when he first saw it, and having in answer to the question, “ Have you read the opinion of the Supreme Court reversing this case?” said, “ Yes, I have,” the court erred in not permitting defendant’s counsel to ask the plaintiff the following question: “ Have you not made a different statement in your testimony on this trial as to the distance the train was from you when you first saw it, from the statements you made in your testimony on the former trials of this case, by reason of the Supreme Court having reversed the case and you having seen the grounds upon which the case was reversed ? ’ ’ because said question was legitimate for the purpose of showing plaintiff’s motive in making such different statements, and thereby to discredit his testimony. 39 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, 144, 145, and note; Railway v. Balthasar, 17 Atl. Rep., 518. 2. The verdict is excessive, showing that the jury were prejudiced against the defendant.

"ON MOTION FOR REHEARING. Per Curiam. This appeal was heretofore dismissed because the record disclosed that no final judgment had been entered in the court below. A tract of land was sued for, and upon a verdict in favor of plaintiffs as to a portion of the defendants and against plaintiffs as to the rest of the defendants, judgment was rendered in accordance therewith. The motion for a new trial filed by plaintiffs was overruled as to a portion of the defendants, who recovered a judgment against plaintiffs, and sustained as to the rest of such defendants. Our conclusion is, that this had the effect of granting a new trial as to all the defendants, and hence that the cause stands on the docket as if there had been no trial. Wootters v. Kauffman, 67 Texas, 488. The motion for rehearing will therefore be overruled. Overruled. Delivered February 15, 1893.","John Parker et al. v. W. A. Adams et al. No. 965. Judgment not Final, When — Effect of Granting Plaintiff New Trial as to Part of Defendants.—Where, in trespass to try title, plaintiff’s motion for new trial is sustained as to some of the defendants and overruled as to others, this has the effect of granting a new trial as to all the defendants, and the case then stands on the docket as though there had been no trial. Error from Dallas. Tried below before Hon. R. E. Burke. This suit was brought by plaintiffs in error in trespass to try title. There was a verdict and judgment thereon in favor of plaintiffs against twelve of the defendants, and against plaintiffs in favor of the other defendants, twenty-one in number.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. August 20, 1889, the appellee, P. J. Norwood, brought this suit against J. W. Welborn and T. H. Griffin, appellants, in the County Court of Johnson County, to recover the sum of $194.26, besides interest and 10 per cent attorney fees, as evidenced by a promissory note executed by appellants to appellee. Appellants filed a special defense, charging failure of consideration, in this, that the note sued upon was executed in consideration-of a promise by plaintiff that he would deliver to defendants a certain promissory note for the sum of $173.45, which had been previously drawn in favor of plaintiff by P. H. Welborn and two others, and that plaintiff had failed and refused to deliver up, in compliance with his promise, the note so previously executed. Delivered December 13, 1892. To this plea the court sustained a special exception, and we think correctly. The plea nowhere specifies that the plaintiff undertook to surrender the note at any particular time. If, as stated in the plea, the note sued upon was received by the plaintiff in consideration of the cancellation of the substituted note, the latter could constitute no obligation against the defendants, whether it was actually surrendered or not. The time of performance in no way appears to have been of the essence of the agreement to surrender, and the plaintiff, by the terms of the agreement, was not called upon to surrender the former note before asserting the latter. Tied, on Com. Paper, sec. 204. Appellant Welborn filed a further defense, alleging that the consideration for said note was illegal, in this, that the note sued upon was executed in consideration of the “promise of the plaintiff to refrain and desist from prosecuting P. H. Welborn, who is the son of this defendant (J. W. Welborn), for forging and passing a certain note alleged by plaintiff to have been forged by P. H. Welborn, and to conceal from the officers of the law all the information and knowledge that the plaintiff had of the fact that P. H. Welborn had forged and passed said note.” The note referred to as forged was the note already referred to for $173.45, executed by P. H. Welborn and two others in favor of plaintiff. A special exception was sustained to this plea, and we think erroneously. The ground of the exception is, that the answer 16 does not allege by any positive averment that P. H. Welborn forged said note for $173.45.” The answer does show an agreement not to prosecute P. H. Welborn for forgery. It shows an agreement on the part of the plaintiff, in consideration of the note sued on, to stifle a prosecution and to suppress evidence with reference to the investigation of a felony. We think these facts, if true, were sufficient to taint the contract and avoid it. Wegner Bros. v. Biering & Co., 65 Texas, 509; Tied. on Com. Paper, sec. 183. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Meversed and remanded.","J. W. Welborn et al. v. P. J. Norwood. No. 732. 1. Promissory Note — Failure of Consideration — Surrender of Another Note. — A plea charging failure of consideration, in this, that the note sued on was executed in consideration of a promise by plaintiff to deliver up another note previously executed to plaintiff, and which he had failed to so surrender, is bad on special exception in failing to show that plaintiff undertook to surrender such other note at any particular time, or that time was of the essence of the agreement to surrender it. 2.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This controversy involves the title to a lot of jewelry, recovered by appellee from M. J. Dooley and G. W. Cotter, appellants. It became a material inquiry on the trial in the court below, whether the jewelry was the property of appellee M. M. Miller, or her son, R. A. Miller, as a member of the firm of R. A. Miller & Co., of which firm appellant M. J. Dooley was the other partner. The jewelry had been deposited with appellant Cotter, to indemnify him as the surety of the firm for a firm debt, which debt was afterwards paid. Dooley claimed that the jewelry had not only been deposited for this purpose, but also that it had become a part of the firm assets. This was denied by appellee and her son, R. A. Miller. The first assignment of error complains of the exclusion of testimony, as appears from the bill of exceptions, substantially as follows: “The plaintiff having introduced the witness R. A. Miller, after the conclusion of the direct examination of said witness, defendant’s counsel, on cross-examination, asked the witness the following question: ‘ Did you or not, on or about the-day of January, 1887, write a certain letter to defendant M. J. Dooley, in which you stated that you would send to Louisr ville, Kentucky, and redeem certain jewelry, and after you secured the same you would put it into the business of R. A. Miller die Co., and defendant M. J. Dooley could use it, or sell it to raise money for said business ?’ To which said witness replied that he did not write any such letter. Whereupon defendant’s counsel exhibited a certain letter, of date -day of January, 1887, purporting to have been written by said witness R. A. Miller to said defendant M. J. Dooley, and asked said witness if he wrote said letter, to which said witness replied that he did; and after plaintiff had closed her testimony, defendant M. J. Dooley offered said letter, dated-day of January, 1887, purporting to have been written by said witness to defendant M. J. Dooley, and containing in it the statement that witness R. A. Miller would send to Louisville, Kentucky, and redeem certain jewelry, and after he received it he would put it into the business of R. A. Miller & Co., and said defendant M. J. Dooley could use it, or sell it to raise money for said business.” The first objection urged by appellee to the introduction of this testimony was, that she had called the witness only to prove the purpose for which the property had been pledged, to-wit, to secure the firm debt, and that this debt had been paid, and that she had interrogated the witness only on these issues. This objection is not sustained by the record. In his testimony in chief the witness stated, “ Said jewelry is my mother’s, and has always been.” The second objection was, that the declaration was not shown to have come to the knowledge of appellee, and she could not be bound thereby. The third and last objection was, that it was an immaterial inquiry, and hence the witness could not be contradicted thereon. It seems perfectly clear to us that the testimony was admissible, at least to contradict and discredit the witness. The evidence was very conflicting between witnesses for plaintiff and defendants below, and therefore the question of credibility was one of prime importance. Miller & English v. Jannett, 63 Texas, 82. The exclusion of this evidence, therefore, necessitates a reversal of the judgment. Complaint is also made of the court’s action in giving and refusing charges. Without reviewing in detail the charges given and refused, in view of another trial, we suggest that if the pleadings and proof should be substantially the same as this record discloses, that the following issues should by appropriate instructions be submitted: 1. Whether or not the property belonged to appellee. 2. If the title to the property was in her, whether or not, by her consent, it had become a part of the assets of the firm of R. A. Miller & Co., as claimed by Dooley. If the jury should find the affirmative of the first isssue, and the negative of the second, the verdict should be for appellee, otherwise it should be against her. We think the court took the proper view of Cotter’s liability for costs. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Beversed and remanded. Delivered January 17, 1893.","M. J. Dooley et al. v. M. M. Miller. No. 59. Evidence — Contradicting Witness. — In an action involving the title to certain jewelry, R.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Van Sickle and Corbin were stockholders in the Island City Savings Bank at the time of its suspension of business in January, 1885. After the failure of the bank a proposition was made to a meeting of its stockholders by S. Heidenheimer and others, which was, in substance, that if the owners of all of the stock of the bank would transfer and deliver to the signers of the communication all of the shares, and if the creditors of the bank would consent to accept 74 peícent of the amounts due them in full settlement, such signers would provide the sum of $100,000 for the purpose of carrying on the business of the bank, under a new organization and by the issuance of new stock, under the charter of the bank, and would settle the debts on the proposed basis. It was also proposed, that ten days be allowed in which the stockholders and depositors might subscribe for the $100,000 of new stock, and that the proposers would take such balance as might be left untaken at the expiration of that time. By resolution this proposition was accepted by the unanimous vote of the meeting, at which more than three-fourths of the stockholders were present, and the directors were authorized to do all that was necessary to carry into effect the proposed arrangement. The resolution recited that the stockholders should surrender their certificates for such disposition as Heidenlieimer and his associates might see proper to make, and directed that such stockholders deliver their certificates transferred in blank to the Island City Savings Bank, that they might thereafter be disposed of to carry out the object in view. Thereafter, on February 21, 1885, the board of directors by resolution authorized the president and cashier of the bank to transfer and deliver to Heidenkeimer and his associates all the property of the bank, in consideration of their undertaking to settle with the creditors. The property was in fact delivered to the subscribers of the proposition and they discharged the debts, raising $22,000 as a donation to aid in so doing, the assets lacking that amount to pay 74 per cent of the liabilities. All of the old stockholders, except Corbin, Van Sickle, and one other, surrendered their stock as contemplated by the proceedings. One thousand shares of $100 each of what is called the new stock were issued, some of which were taken by old stockholders and the remainder by others. The holders of this new stock assumed control of the bank, treating it as the only stock of the corporation entitled to recognition. On March 10, 1885, the directors of the bank, by resolution, undertook to make an assessment of 8100 on each share of the original stock, and declared that unless payment thereof was made in thirty days by the owner of said stock, it should be thereafter forfeited, and new stock was authorized to be issued and sold in lieu thereof. Notice was given to Corbin and Van Sickle of this action. Neither of them was present at any of the meetings, and never in any way consented to or ratified the action of the other stockholders and board of directors. They had paid in full for their stock, and advanced no additional sum and took none of the new shares. The charter of the organization authorized its capital stock to be increased to $200,000. Before the proceedings above recited there were 1141 shares of $100 each, all of which had been fully paid for. Corbin and Van Sickle, in 1889, transferred their certificates to appellant. He made demand of the defendant company for the transfer to be made upon the books and for recognition as a shareholder. This was refused, and he brought this suit to compel the bank to execute such transfers and to reinstate him as a stockholder; and in case that could not be done, to recover damages for the conversion of his stock. The defendant answered, and all of the holders of new stock intervened, setting up the proceedings above stated in bar of the action. The court below instructed the jury to find for appellant the highest market value of thirty-two shares of stock between the time of conversion and the trial, and to deduct therefrom 8100 per share, with interest from 1885, in order to put him on an equal footing with the intervenors. The jury found for appellant 8448. We think it clear that the actions taken by the stockholders and directors of the bank did not have the effect to cancel the stock held by Corbin and Van Sickle. Without their consent their shares could not be thus forfeited. 1 Mora, on Priv. Corp., 208. Having paid the par value of the stock, it was not subject to further assessment for any purpose. Id., 131. The existence of the corporation, with the powers conferred by its charter, continued, notwithstanding the insolvency of the bank and its consequent suspension of business, and the legal rights of individual shareholders could not be taken from them by the majority, however large, and the attempt of such a majority was beyond the power of the corporation. Bank v. Sachtleben, 67 Texas, 425. The shares upon which this suit is based, therefore, continued in full force, notwithstanding the declaration that they were worthless and would be considered cancelled. By the arrangement, however, between the promotors of the new organization, if such it may be called, and those shareholders who assented to the proposition made to them and surrendered and transferred their stock, the former acquired all the rights which such stock represented; and in order to arrive at the right of appellant it is necessary to take the old stock thus transferred into consideration. For it can hardly be contended that by such transfer and surrender Corbin and Van Sickle acquired any additional interest in the concern. It seems equally true that they are not entitled to be placed upon an equal footing with the holders of new stock; for these acquired all the rights of the other old stockholders ""and contributed 8100,000 to the capital stock with which the business was resumed. Thus the new shares when issued represented both the rights of the old stockholders who transferred their shares, and those acquired through the new subscription. Counsel for appellant, in their brief, treat the issuance of the new certificates as being, in legal effect, an increase of the capital stock under the power given in the charter; and for the purpose of ascertaining the relative rights of appellant and other stockholders, this seems to us the true light in which to regard it. But if we should hold that appellant’s shares are equal to the others, this would give to the transaction the effect of a reduction of stock; for there would then be only 1036 shares of $100 each, whereas there were formerly 1141 shares of the same denomination. It is evident that the purpose of the negotiation was that Heidenheimer .and those acting under him should secure all the rights of the old stockholders, and also an interest equal to their subscription of $100,000. They did acquire the interest of all holders of stock who assented. The new stock was then issued to represent all of the rights which thus arose. This was binding on the holders of the old stock who gave their assent, creditors were all satisfied, and the rights of Corbin and Van Sickle were therefore as 32 to 2141. It is true, if 1000 shares in addition to 1141 had been actually issued, this would exceed the maximum limit fixed by the charter for the capital stock. This was not really done. By the consent of all persons concerned, but the three nonassenting members, the stock was fixed at $100,000, represented by 1000 shares. It is necessary to ascertain the proportionate interest which appellant’s stock continued to represent as against the holders of the new stock, and this is arrived at in the way indicated. The questions remain, Is the appellant still in an attitude to maintain his right as a stockholder, and if so, what relief should be granted to him ? Appellee contends that appellant’s assignors should be held to have acquiesced, by their delay to sue, in the action by the stockholders and directors. They did nothing affirmatively showing an intent to do so. The acceptance by Corbin of the money paid him as a creditor of the bank can not be held to have such effect. The nature of the demand made upon them was such as to call for positive action, rather than mere silence, to signify assent to the transaction. Their failure to transfer and surrender their stock prevents any inference of acquiescence from their silence. As to their failure to sue, the statute of limitations prescribes the time which would constitute a bar. The well settled principles of equity, by which a party may be precluded by loches from attacking unauthorized acts of a corporation of which he is a member, do not apply to the facts of this case. Because of such delay, however, if for no other reason, we think the aid of equity to reinstate him in the enjoyment of the • privileges of a stockholder should be withheld. The managers of the bank have been allowed to go on and establish its organization in accord.anee with the arrangements made in 1885; the business of the bank is doubtless readjusted to the conditions arising out of them. The consequences of forcing appellant into the corporation as a shareholder upon the basis of his right, as we find it to be, may not be easily foreseen. He can be compensated in money for any damages which he has sustained, and we think, under the circumstances, that should be his remedy. The measure of damages should be the value of the stock, treating it as 32 shares in 2141, at the time of its conversion, with legal interest thereon to the date of trial. A majority of the court hold, that under the facts of this case, such conversion took place at the date of demand by appellant for recognition- as a stockholder and the issuance of certificates to him, and the refusal of defendant to accord to him such right. The value at that time should be ascertained and form the basis of recovery at another trial. Cook on Stock and Stockh., sec. 581, and notes. Plaintiff’s exceptions to the plea of intervention should have been sustained, in the absence of allegations showing that the defense would not be properly conducted by the defendant. The stockholders are not ordinarily proper parties in such a case. From what we have said, it follows that the court should have sustained plaintiff’s exceptions to the third and fourth subdivisions of defendant’s answer, in which the resolutions of the board of directors attempting to assess and cancel the stock were relied on as a bar to the action. The defendant, however, adopted the plea of interveners, and the proceedings of the stockholders’ meeting therein set up, showing the proposition of Heidenheimer and others, and its acceptance, while constituting no bar to the suit, are proper to be considered in determining the rights thereby acquired, as we have defined them, as are all other facts affecting that question. Upon the written transfers of the stock appellant was entitled to maintain the action. He acquired only such rights as his assignors had, and he can not be considered an innocent purchaser. Evidence therefore as to the agreement with his assignors, under which he acquired the certificates, under present issues, would be immaterial. While we have not followed in their order and in detail the points raised in the briefs, what has been said disposes of all 'questions necessary to a decision. ■ The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded, in order that inquiry may be made as to the value-of the stock at the date of conversion as above indicated. That seems to be the only issue that needs to be submitted to the jury. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 19, 1893.","Walter Gresham v. Island City Savings Bank. No. 80. 1. Bank Reorganization—Action of Stockholders and Directors. In 1885, under proposition for reorganization made by some of the directors and stockholders of an insolvent bank, it was proposed that if all stockholders would surrender their shares of stock, and the creditors would accept seventy-four per cent of their debts' in full payment, the proposers would provide $1,000,000 for the purpose of resuming business under a new organization. At a meeting of the stockholders of the insolvent bank, at which more than three-fourths were present, the proposition was accepted, and the directors were authorized to do all that was necessary to carry into effect the proposed arrangement, which they subsequently did by transferring to the new organization all of the property of the bank. One thousand shares of new stock were issued and taken, and these new stockholders assumed control of the bank. All the old stock, except thirty-two shares held by Corbin and Van Sickle, and now by appellant, were surrendered. Corbin and Van Sickle were not present at any of the meetings, and never in any way consented to or ratified the action of the other stockholders. They had paid in full for their stock, and advanced no additional sum, and took none of the new shares. Thereafter, by resolution, the directors undertook to make an assessment of $100 on each share of the old stock, and declared that unless payment thereof was made in thirty days by the owner of the old stock, it should be forfeited. Notice of this resolution was given to Corbin and Van Sickle. Held: 1. It is clear that the action taken by the stockholders and directors of the bank did not have the effect to cancel the thirty-two shares of stock held by Cor-bin and Van Sickle. Without their consent, their shares could not be thus forfeited. 2. As to paid up stock assessments, Corbin and Van Sickle having paid par value for their stock, it was not subject to further assessment for any purpose. The corporate existence of the old organization continued, notwithstanding its insolvency and suspension of business, and the legal rights of shareholders could not be taken from them by a majority, however large. 3. As to the rights of the new organization, it acquired all the rights represented by the surrendered stock, and the new shares when issued represented both the rights of the old stockholders who had surrendered their shares, and those acquired through the new subscriptions. 2. Measure of Damages.—There were 1141 old shares, and 1000 new, and the rights of Corbin and Van Sickle (now owned by appellant), were therefore as 32 to 2141, and the measure of damages should be the value of the stock, treating it as 32 shares in 2141, at the time of its conversion, with legal interest thereon from that day to the day of trial. 3. Old Stockholder not Stockholder in New Bank. — Because of his delay in demanding recognition as a stockholder, and suing for the value of his stock, the aid of equ.ty to reinstate appellant in the enjoyment of the privileges of a stockholder in the new organization should be withheld. The managers of the bank have been allowed to go on and establish it in accordance with the arrangements made in 1885, and the business of the bank is doubtless readjusted to its changed conditions, and appellant can be compensated in money for any damage he has sustained, •and that should be his remedy. 4. Date of Conversion. — The conversion of the stock of appellant took place at the date of the demand by appellant for recognition as a stockholder. 5. Proper Parties. — The stockholders are not ordinarily proper parties to such a suit as this, and exceptions to the petition in intervention of the stockholders should have been sustained, in the absence of allegation that the defense would not be properly conducted by the defendant. 6. Assignee’s Bight to Sue. — Appellant was not an innocent holder of the thirty-two shares of stock owned by Corbin and Van Sickle, and acquired only their rights by his purchase, but he had the right to maintain this suit upon their written transfer of their stock. Appeal from Galveston. Tried below before Hon. William H. Stewart. Frank M. Spencer and Gresham & Jones, for appellants. 1. The intervening shareholders of the defendant company are not proper parties, in the absence of allegation that the defendant company neglects and refuses to defend the suit, and the petition in intervention should have been dismissed. Evans v. Brandon, 53 Texas, 56; Bronson v. La Crosse R., 2 Wall., 283; Thomp. on Liability of Agts. and Off., 381, 382, 394. 2. The subsequent increase of the capital stock of appellee company, and the issuance of new certificates thereon, did not render appellant’s stock liable to assessment or cancellation. 3. The old shareholders had a pre-emption right to the new shares when issued, but they were not compelled to take them, and upon declining to do so, they could be sold to new parties, and the money received should go into the company’s capital, to be administered in the interest of all their associates. Appellee corporation could replenish its capital stock by the issuance and sale of additional stock, but it could not cancel appellant’s stock without his consent. The new shares of stock did not differ from the old shares; each had paid $100 a share, and each represented an undivided interest in the corporate rights, privileges, and property. That is, each share represents a fractional interest in the entire corporate concern, and no special privileges or advantage can be given to the incoming members. “ The sum is equal to its parts.” 2 Mora, on Priv.

State Rep., 169. 3. Leaving out all equities in the case, and waiving the question of estoppel, which is unanswerable, the plaintiff’s measure of damages would be the proportional share of thirty-two shares as against 1000 new stockholders and 1141 old stockholders. The estimated value of the stock was made by witnesses on the basis of 1000 shares new stock. If the 1141 shares of old stock (which was surrendered to the new stock holders and now owned by them) should come in for a division, as Gresham is now seeking to have his thirty-two shares do, the value of the stock would be reduced more than one-half. The jury found the value of the stock at $150 per share, and their calculation was as follows: 32 shares of stock, at $150 .................... $4,800 00 Deduct $100 per share...........___.......... $3,200 00 Four years and six months interest at 8 per cent.. 1,152 00— 4,352 00 Amount of verdict................................... $ 448 00"
"KEY, Associate Justice. Appellees, Williams & Russell, as plaintiffs, brought this suit against L. H. Lambert, Tom Harrison, and William Coit as defendants, to recover $611.49 on open account against Lambert, and to foreclose a mechanic’s lien on a certain house and lot in the city of San Antonio as against all the defendants. Wm. Cameron & Co. filed a plea of intervention, claiming the house and lot as their own, alleging that they acquired title thereto through defendants Lambert and Harrison, and asking to have their title quieted, and in the alternative for a decree establishing a lien in their favor for a debt owing from Lambert and Harrison to them. The case was tried before a jury, and plaintiffs recovered judgment for the full amount sued for and decree establishing and foreclosing a lien on the house and lot; and intervenors recovered judgment for $900 and decree establishing and foreclosing a lien on the same property. Neither lien was accorded priority, and the judgment directs, that if the property should not sell for sufficient to pay both debts, that the proceeds be pro rated between plaintiffs and intervenors, Cameron & Co. Cameron & Co. filed a motion for a new trial, which was overruled, and they have appealed. Lambert and Harrison filed no motion for a new trial, but gave notice of appeal, filed appeal bonds, and filed joint assignments of error with Cameron & Co. The second assignment of error reads thus: “ The court erred in giving charge number 2 as requested by plaintiffs.” There are several other assignments of error, no more specific than the one just quoted. These assignments are too general to require consideration. An assignment of error, to be sufficient, must distinctly specify .the grounds of error relied on. A number of objections may be urged to the action of the court in giving a particular charge. It may enunciate a radically unsound principle of law; or it may be abstractly correct, but inapplicable to the facts of the particular case; or it may be upon the weight of testimony. Hence an assignment of error thereon should in some manner, however briefly, indicate the reason why the complaining party charges that error was committed in giving a charge. The reason for the rule'may not apply with as much force when it is sought to predicate error upon the refusal to give a certain charge asked. But even then it may reasonably be expected, if not required, that in addition to charging that there was error in refusing to give the instruction asked, the assignment will state that it was applicable to a stated phase of the case, unless it be such a charge as applies alike to all cases, and that it was not embraced in the main charge. Rev. Stats., art. 1037; Sup. Ct. rule 24; Robertson v. Coates, 1 Texas Civ. App., 664. There was no reversible error in permitting appellee R. H. Russell to state, as a witness, the amount for which he had sold certain lots acquired by the firm of Williams & Russell under an execution sale on their former judgment against Lambert. If the defendants or interveners in the court below could have shown a satisfaction of the former judgment against Lambert, the plaintiffs would not, perhaps, have been entitled to recover as much as they sued for. But in so far as the lots about which Russell testified could have had any bearing upon that question, the net proceeds of their sale by the sheriff, in the absence of fraud on the part of the plaintiffs, would have been the amount to have been credited on the former judgment, and not the real value of the lots. So, as the matter appears in the record, the testimony complained of was wholly immaterial, and not calculated to prejudice the rights of appellants. Appellees recovered judgment establishing their debt against Lambert for the full amount sued for, and fixing a lien upon the house and lot involved for the payment of the same. According to the uncontradicted testimony of appellee R. H. Russell, a portion of the account sued on, and for which the judgment establishes a lien against the property, was for painting a fence where Lambert then resided, which was upon another street, and no part of the premises involved. That mechanics’ and material men’s liens do not attach to other premises separate and distinct from those upon which the improvement or repairs are made, is a rule of law too well settled to require any citation of authorities to support it. It follows, therefore, that appellees were not entitled to have a lien established against the property in controversy for the entire amount of the debt sued upon; and as Cameron & Co. have a lien on the same property, they can complain of this error, though Lambert, as he filed no motion for a new trial, can not. As the record shows that Cameron & Co. are subrogated to whatever rights Harrison ever had in the property in question, we have not considered the case with reference to his rights, further than as they affect the rights of Cameron & Co. In reference to the question of two judgments being rendered against Lambert for the same debt, if such be the case, which does not appear as a distinct fact found by the jury, as the former judgment does not fix a lien against the property involved in this case, no one but Lambert could complain; and as he failed to file a motion for a new trial, the application of correct rules of practice would, perhaps, preclude him also from complaint on that score. However, in our opinion, a court ought not to render two independent judgments against a party for the same debt. If any part of the debt sued for in this action is embraced in the judgment in the other case, the amount thereof can be ascertained, and a judgment rendered that will supersede the former judgment and afford adequate protection to all parties. To obtain the requisite data for this purpose, it may become necessary to submit the case to the jury on special issues. The judgment of the District Court will be reversed and cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 1, 1893.","Lewis H. Lambert et al. v. Williams & Russell. No. 45. 1. Assignment of Error—Charge Given.—An assignment of error upon a charge given should in some manner indicate the reason why the complaining party urge that error was committed in giving the charge. 2. Same — Charge Refused.—Where the refusing of a charge is assigned as error, the assignment should state that the charge refused was applicable to a stated phase of the case, unless it be such as applies to all cases, and not embraced in the general charge. 3. Mechanic’s Lien.—The mechanic’s and material man’s liens do not attach to other premises separate and distinct from those upon which the improvements or repairs are made. See example. 4. Necessity for Motion for New Trial.—In absence of a motion for new trial in the lower court, an error apparent in the record against the party so failing can not be urged by another party.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On July 3, 1888, appellee, while en route from Brenham to Waco, was a passenger upon the cars of appellant; and ■desiring to change from the said train to the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway, running from Temple Junction to Waco, when appellant’s train ■■stopped at said junction appellee undertook to leave the car, but before he could get entirely off, the train started, and he continued his attempt to leave while the train was in motion, and in so doing was thrown upon •the ground and sustained the injuries for which he recovered. The evidence sustains the verdict of the jury, that appellant did not stop its train long enough to reasonably enable its passengers to leave the cars; and also, that the cars were moving so slowly that appellant acted as an ordinarily prudent person would have done in making the attempt to leave as he did, and was therefore not chargeable with contributory negligence. The amount of the verdict is not complained of. . Appellant complains of the action of the court in overruling its special exception to plaintiff’s petition, on the ground that the same was duplicitous, in that in one count it alleges that appellee was thrown from the car without fault on his part, and in another that he was injured by voluntarily attempting to leave the train. We are of opinion that the action of the court was correct, and that the petition was properly framed to meet the different phases of the case as it might be developed by the evidence. Appellant also complains at the action of the court in giving the following paragraph of its charge to the jury, viz.: “If plaintiff was injured, and the proximate cause of the injury was defendant’s negligence, plaintiff would be entitled to recover; but if the proximate cause of the injury was plaintiff’s contributory negligence, defendant would be entitled to a verdict, even though defendant may have been negligent also; and if plaintiff and defendant were equally negligent, plaintiff could not recover.” The ground of appellant’s objection is, that this charge recognizes the erroneous doctrine of comparative negligence. If this charge stood alone, it might very well be held that it was calculated to lead the jury to understand that even though plaintiff was negligent, yet if his negligence was not equal in degree to that of defendant, he would not be precluded from recovering against it. This, of course, would be error. Railway v. Gorbett, 49 Texas, 573. But we are of opinion that there is no positive error in this charge, and that its only defect consists in its liability to mislead, and that this liability was sufficiently corrected in other parts of the main charge given the jury, as well as in the special charge given at the request of the defendant. This special charge is as follows: “If you believe defendant guilty of negligence as alleged in plaintiff’s petition, in order for you to find for plaintiff you must believe that negligence to have been the proximate cause of the injury, without any contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff. By proximate cause, is meant the actual, direct cause of the injury. By contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff, is meant such imprudent or negligent conduct on his part, without which the accident would not have occurred.” The giving of the charge complained of is therefore held not to be sufficient cause to require a reversal. Appellant also complains of the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain this verdict, and we have had great hesitancy in affirming the judgment of the court below upon this ground: It seems to us that the strong preponderance of the evidence tends to show that appellant did stop its train a reasonable time to enable appellee to alight therefrom, and was therefore not guilty of any negligence in starting it when it did. We also think that the preponderance of the evidence tends to the conclusion that appellee, at his age (72), was guilty of contributory negligence in attempting to leave a moving train; but after a careful examination, we believe it would not be proper for us to disturb the finding of the jury upon these questions, after such finding has been approved by the trial court. As to the length of time the train s'topped for the passengers to leave, the witness Rison, who was with appellee, testified: “ When the train reached the junction I spoke to plaintiff as soon as the train stopped, saying, this is our getting off place. He got up at once. I don’t think the train stopped ten seconds.” And appellee for himself testified: “As soon as the train stopped Mr. Rison told me that was our getting off place, and I immediately got up and walked right out, without stopping to talk or speak to any one. I don’t know whether the car was in motion or not. If it was, I did not notice it.” A number of other witnesses, however, including passengers, as well as employes of appellant, testify, that the train was stopped the usual time, and appellee did not attempt to leave until about the time it started. As to the speed the train was going at the time appellee got off, his testimony as above set forth was corroborated by that of appellant’s brakeman Bennedetti, who says: “The train was in motion when he got off. The train was just beginning to move up grade, and was moving very gently and slowly, and had gone but about half the length of a car at the time plaintiff got off.” The testimony of several other witnesses, including appellee’s witness Rison, however, tends very strongly to show a much higher rate of speed. In this state of the evidence as above shown we do not feel authorized to disturb the verdict of the jury, but we would have been better satisfied with a different result. Railway v. Smith, 59 Texas, 406; Railway v. Leslie, 57 Texas, 83. We are therefore of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 10, 1893.

Pleading not Duplicitous, When .—Plaintiff’s petition in a suit against a railway company for personal injuries is not duplicitous because it alleges in one count that plaintiff was thrown from the car without fault on his part, and in another that he was injured by voluntarily attempting to leave the train. 2. Contributory Negilgence—Charge of Court.—A charge of court that “ if plaintiff was injured, and the proximate cause of the injury was plaintiff’s contributory negligence, defendant would be entitled to a verdict, even though defendant may have been negligent also; and if plaintiff and defendant were equally negligent, plaintiff could not recover,” is calculated to mislead the jury as to the doctrine of comparative negligence; but this is sufficiently corrected where, in another part of the charge, the jury are further instructed, that if they believe the defendant guilty of negligence, then in order to find for plaintiff they must believe such negligence to have been the proximate cause of the injury without any contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This action was brought in the County Court of Galveston County by the Gulf Land Company against the Galveston City Kailroad Company, to recover rent on a contract for the lease of the east half of outlet 119 in the city of Galveston. The defense was, that since the execution of the lease in 1884, and before the accrual of the rents sued for, the property leased had been sub-r merged and encroached upon by the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, so that it was in great part below ordinary high tide, and that because of the cutting away of the beach, and the consequent depletion of the land, it had ceased to be owned by plaintiff, and was not subject to lease nor under private dominion, and the lease was therefore terminated. The plaintiff replied, traversing the answer, and asserting that the property had been leased by defendant to prevent another street railway company from gaining the control or use of it. Trial was had without a jury, and judgment was for plaintiff. No conclusions of fact and of law were filed by the judge who tried the case. 1. The contract for lease was in writing, and is as follows: “Articles of agreement made and entered into this 30th day of April, A. D. 1884, by and between the Gulf Land Company, of the County of Galveston, State of Texas, party of the first part, and the Galveston City Railroad Company, of said county and State, party of the second part, for the lease and occupation of the properties herein mentioned, witnesseth: “ That for and in consideration of the rents herein reserved, and of the covenants and stipulations herein entered into by the party of the second part, by said party to be observed and performed, the said party of the.’ first part has leased and by these presents doth lease unto the party of the second part all and singular that certain piece or parcel of land lying and being situated in the city of Galveston, in the county of Galveston and State of Texas, and known and described as according to the map and plan of the city as part of outlet numbered 119, being the east half of said outlot numbered 119. “To have and to hold, use, and enjoy the same, and every part thereof, unto the said party of the second part and its assigns, for and during the period of eight years and two months from and after the first day of May, 1884, subject only to the following terms and conditions: • “ First. The party of the second part hereby covenants and agrees in consideration thereof that it will pay therefor to the party of the first, part the sum of 8100 every three months, lawful money, in advance, on the first of each and every third month on and after the first day of May, 1884, at the office of the said party of the second part, to the said party of the first part or its lawful authorized agents. “ Second. The party of the second part may erect and construct buildings and improvements on said leased premises, and at the termination of this lease may remove such improvements therefrom, all rents being first paid, excepting and reserving the trees, shrubbery, plants, and sodding, which becomes the property of the owners of the soil as soon as placed therein or thereon, and which are not to be disturbed except for the purpose of cultivation or improvement. “ Third. The party of the second part covenants and agrees to and with the party of the first part, that neither sand nor earth shall be taken. away or removed from said premises leased, and that said premises shall be kept intact, and that the same shall be surrendered to the parties of the first part at the expiration of the term of this lease, with the same surface area as when leased; provided, however, that the party of the second part shall not be held liable or responsible for any injury, waste, or depletion resulting from the act of God or any other cause beyond the control of the party of the second part. Nothing in this article contained shall be construed as to prevent the party of the second part from handling and removing the earth and sand from point to point for the purpose of grading, levelling, or other necessary improvements upon said premises. ‘ ‘ Fourth. It is agreed by and between the parties, each with the other, that the party of the' first part shall render for taxation to the proper officers of the property herein leased, that the parties of the second part shall pay all taxes levied and assessed thereon, without recourse on the party of the first part therefor, and will deliver to the party of the first .part all vouchers and tax receipts executed by the proper officers as evidence of such payments. “ Fifth'. It is agreed between the parties, that the party of the second part shall pay the State, county, and school taxes for the year 1884, the city tax having been paid before the date of this lease. “Sixth. It is understood by and between the parties, each with the other, that a lien is to exist upon all improvements erected upon said leased premises during this lease to insure the payment of the rent of said premises as stipulated herein, the payment of said rent as it becomes due to operate as a discharge of said property from said lien for the current rent without other written discharge of said lien. “ Seventh. The party of the second part covenants and agrees to and with the party of the first part, that during this lease the said party of the second part will keep the aforesaid premises enclosed with a good and lawful fence along the east and north boundaries thereof, and will keep the boundaries of the front or south side of the premises protected as near the line of common high tide as practicable. 1 ‘ In testimony of all of which, the said Gulf Land Company and the Galveston City Eailway Company have caused this agreement to be signed by their respective presidents and attested by their respective seals, on the day and year first above written.” The contract was duly signed by both parties, and was acknowledged for record by the Gulf Land Company by its president. 2. The land is on the shore of the Gulf of Mexico, and when the lease was executed, and for some time prior thereto, about two-thirds thereof was below ordinary high tide, which was known to the defendant. Since said time there has been a continual depletion of the land by the encroachment of the waters of the gulf upon the shore, and at the time of trial, and when defendant refused to pay rent, there was only about one-seventy-second part of the entire property above ordinary high tide, and this portion is all on the beach, which by city ordinance is declared a public highway. There was a considerable erosion of the land at the time of the storm in 1886, and the greater part occurred then and since. 3. On November 1, 1889, the defendant failed to pay the installment of rent then due, and refused to pay rent except for such portion of the land as was not on or beyond the beach and under water, and ■ no rent has been paid for the time since November 1, 1889. 4. No improvements were upon the land when the lease was executed, nor were any placed thereon during the lease. The land was not used nor occupied by the defendant for any purpose, but defendant had a large building just northwest of the property, and leased the same to prevent its being occupied by objectionable neighbors, and to prevent the Gulf City Railway and Real Estate Company, a rival railway company, from renting or occupying it and getting its line of street railway through to the east end of the island. Defendant did not use nor occupy the property, and made no business use thereof. Defendant stopped paying rent about the time it became consolidated with the rival company. While we believe that in a proper case rent for property totally destined should be abated, and when there is a partial destruction of the property it should be apportioned, we do not think that principle of law applies to the facts of this case. The purpose of the lease was clearly to prevent the use of any part of the lot by the Gulf City Street Railway and Real Estate Company; and it is evident that the defendant, when it procured the lease, was willing to pay the entire sum of money the full term amounted to in order to be able to keep the rival company from using the property. Defendant got all that it ever realty contracted for. It knew at the time the lease was made that about two-thirds of the land was under water, and was a daily witness of this erosion of the beach and the encroachment of the water. We are of the opinion that the judgment of the court below was right, and should, be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 23, 1893. A motion for rehearing was overruled.","Galveston City Railway Company v. Gulf Land Company. No. 219. 1. Lessor and Lessee—Liability of Lessee for Rent.—Appellee leased to appellant a lot on the gulf shore for $400 per annum, payable quarterly in advance. The defense was, that since the execution of the lease, and before the accrual of the rents sued for, the leased property had been submerged and encroached upon by the waters of the gulf, so that it was in great part below ordinary high tide, and because of the cutting away of the beach and the consequent depletion of the land it had ceased to be owned by plaintiff, was not subject to lease, nor under private dominion. Recovery by plaintiff was affirmed. 2. Same—Destroyed Property.—In a proper case, rent for property totally destroyed should be abated, and when there is a partial destruction of the property, apportioned; but in this case the purpose of the lease was to prevent a rival street railway company from using it. The lessor knew when the lease was made that the lot was about two-thirds under water, and was a daily witness of the erosion of the beach and the encroachment of the water.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. The record in this cause is submitted on conclusions of law and fact and a statement of facts filed in the court below. Only one question is raised, to-wit, Was the property in controversy the homestead of appellee at the date of appellants’ levy ? The conclusions of fact filed by the trial court are sustained by the statement of facts; we therefore adopt them as our conclusions of fact. We also concur in the conclusions of law deduced therefrom. Appellee, the head of a family, established his home prior to the levy upon a portion of a block of land 200 feet square, in a village of about 200 inhabitants. The block was subdivided into lots, but without any streets or alleys separating them. Upon a portion of these lots was the residence of the family, which was also used as a hotel. Upon adjacent lots of the same block appellee, with one Martin as his partner, was engaged in keeping a livery stable, at which was kept his own horses and those of his hotel guests, and under an adjacent shelter his family buggy. He also had his cow lots and pig pens on the livery stable lots. The principal contention of appellants seems to be, that the domestic use made of the livery stable lots was merely incidental; that the keeping of a livery stable thereon was the principal use, and imposed on these lots a business rather than a residence character; and that as appellee was engaged in the hotel business he could not also claim the exemption of lots used in the livery business. Delivered November 15, 1892. The Constitution exempts not only “ a lot” but “lots” as a place to exercise the calling or business of the head of a family, and does not restrict this calling or business to any single branch or department. We perceive no reason why adjacent lots should not be exempt, under the Constitution, as a place to carry on the hotel and livery business, if such be the business of the head of the family. The cases cited by appellants seem to us not to be in conflict with the view here expressed. The judgment of the court below will be affirmed. Affirmed.","Schneider & Davis et al. v. T. B. Campbell. No. 25. Homestead Exemption — Place of Business — Double Calling. — The Constitution exempts not only “a lot,” but “lots,” as a place to exercise the calling or business, of the head of a family, and does not restrict this calling or business to any single branch or department.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. William Cunningham prosecutes this writ of error from a judgment rendered by the District Court of Eastland County against him and others in favor of J. H. Holcomb, defendant in error, in the month of December, 1887, on the promissory note of said Cunningham, foreclosing the vendor’s lien on a tract of land situated in Eastland County. The case was tried without a jury. In the month of May, 1884, J. S. Bedford, who was the son-in-law of defendant in error, under a power of attorney authorizing him to convey two certain tracts of land owned by defendant in error in Eastland County, conveyed to plaintiff in error the tract of land upon which the lien was foreclosed by the judgment of the court below. The deed recited a cash consideration of $1400, and three certain negotiable promissory notes of $1666.66 each, payable in one, two, and three years, one of which notes was the foundation of this suit. This deed was executed on the 24th of May, 1884, and recorded the 1st day of July following. No lien was expressly retained in the face of the deed, but the notes recited that they were secured by a lien on the land. About the 12th day of July he conveyed the other tract of land to the same party, the deed reciting a cash consideration of $1200, and three notes for $2600 each, payable in three, four, and five years, to secure the payment of which a lien was expressly reserved in the face of the deed. The proof tended to show, that these two tracts of land did not exceed in value $8000; that these deeds were executed between said Bedford and Cunningham for some fraudulent purpose; that there was no cash paid; that Holcomb was ignorant of the recitals in saicl deed and of any fraudulent purpose on the part of said Bedford and Cunningham; that Cunningham was totally insolvent and without credit; that Holcomb, who lived on his farm in Erath County, was worth about $40,000 above his exemptions and liabilities. At the date of this transaction one Jake Alexander was engaged in the mercantile business in the town of Cisco, claiming to have an investment therein of about $20,000, over and above his debts and liabilities. The proof tended to show, that the purpose in the execution of said deeds, and especially the last deed, was to negotiate the notes with Holcomb’s endorsements to Alexander for an interest in his mercantile business, which was afterward done; and in consideration of which he conveyed to Bedford a one-lialf interest therein. The notes, with the endorsement of Holcomb, were delivered to him, but as the}1"" exceeded in amount the estimated value of a half-interest in said mercantile business, Alexander and Bedford executed to Holcomb their note for the difference, in the sum of $2200. The proof tended to show, that when these notes were negotiated, and the transaction which resulted in the purchase of an interest in the said business was accomplished, said Holcomb was in very feeble health and in a state of mind bordering very close on to imbecility, and that he continued in this condition for sometime afterward — to use his own language, that he was “ not at himself;” and that when he did come to himself (which was after the notes had been negotiated by Alexander), he discov ered that the transaction between Bedford and Cunningham was fraudu lent, and took steps to protect himself from loss on account of the endorsement of said notes. About this time it was developed that Alexander, the merchant, was in a failing condition, and that he owed to one Solomon a debt of over $20,000, to whom said notes had been negotiated by him. It also appears, that after Solomon was notified that Holcomb would resist payment of the notes, a deed of trust was executed upon the stock of goods to secure this debt, and that at a meeting of these several parties, with their attorneys, an arrangement was made, to-wit, in the month of October, 1884, by which the stock of goods should be sold under the deed of trust and bid in by Holcomb at about $18,000, and upon his paying this sum and assuming liens on real estate in the sum of $10,000 additional, his notes should be returned to him, which transaction was consummated; and the loss sustained by Holcomb was estimated at about $10,000. Prior to this last transaction, and after the goods were delivered under the trust deed, Bedford and Cunningham quitted the county of Eastland, where they had been residing, and remained absent from the country up to the time of the trial, nothing being heard from either of them, except that perhaps one of them was in South America. Cunningham, through an attorney who appeared for him, alleged these transactions and charged that they were fraudulent, and that Holcomb, through his agent, had assisted in accomplishing them, and had ratified the act of his alleged agent by endorsing said notes and by purchasing said stock of goods and by bringing this suit upon one of these notes. Delivered November 15, 1892. We think the facts in the record warrant the following conclusions: first, that Bedford and Cunningham entered into a conspiracy to defraud Holcomb, and perhaps others, and that the deeds were executed in pursuance of said fraudulent conspiracy; second, that Holcomb did not knowingly and freely assent thereto; third, that his conduct, upon discovering the fraud, was not intended as a ratification of the same, but was influenced by a prudential desire to protect himself from the consequences of the fraud. While other conclusions might be drawn from the evidence, we think the testimony is sufficient to support the above theories. The principle invoked by the plaintiff m error for a reversal of the judgment of the court below, that where parties have voluntarily entered into a fraudulent contract, neither one will be permitted to become an actor in court, whether to enforce or set aside the contract, seems to be well settled. It is held in this State that even an assignee of a note executed in pursuance of such a contract can not maintain an action thereon where the same has been transferred to him without value paid. Davis v. Sittig, 65 Texas, 497. We are of opinion, however, that this principle is not applicable here. Our construction of the transactions disclosed in the record is that Holcomb was “ more sinned against than sinning.” It seems to be held (as we think correctly), that where a third person conspires with an agent to perpetrate a fraud upon the principal, and the rights of innocent third parties have not intervened, the principal is entitled to have a rescission of the contract made between his agent and such third party; or, if he elects not to have it rescinded, to have such other adequate relief as a court of equity may deem proper under the circumstances. Mech. on Agency, sec. 797. It seems, also, to be laid down, that before a person connected with a fraudulent transaction will be refused a day in court, it must appear that he yielded a free and unbiased consent thereto; and that, in some cases, the most excusable of the parties engaged will be relieved. Bump. on Fraud. Con., 449; Rome. Eq., sec. 403, and notes. Our conclusion is, that the trial court would not have been justified, on the ground of public policy, in refusing the relief sought to be applied, and that the facts warranted the judgment rendered; it is therefore affirmed.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. The appellee, Robert Thompson, sustained the personal injuries on account of which he brought this suit while he was in the employ of appellant railway company as an engineer, and at a point on appellant’s line of railway about three miles northwest of Henrietta, Clay County, Texas. He was at the time of the injury, on April 21, 1885, engaged in propelling backwards, with tender in front, the engine of which he was in charge, with two cabooses. It was derailed, and plaintiff was seriously scalded and bruised. The evidence justifies two conclusions which, in our opinion, the verdict of the jury imports, namely: (1) That the injuries were due to a low joint in the line of defendant’s railway caused by the negligence of the company in failing to properly inspect and repair its track. (2) That the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, as charged by appellant, in running the engine at a dangerous and reckless speed. Appellant first assigns as error the action of the court in excluding the evidence of the witness Ford, by whom it offered to prove that “ an engine with tender in front and two cabooses, in the condition of this train, could not be run with safety with a greater rate of speed than from ten to fifteen miles per hour.” This witness was a lawyer by profession, and had been engaged as a claim agent for the defendant company. While thus engaged he posted himself “ thoroughly as to the construction of engines, watched them in the shops, questioned the engineers about them, and noticed the effects of the speed of a train.” He was in the habit of “ riding on the engines perhaps two-thirds of his time with the engineers and other railroad boys, and would fire for them and frequently run their engines.” When asked as to his ability to testify regarding the comparative safety of running an engine backward, he answered: “ I can only answer from my conversations with engineers and mechanics and the results I have seen from running at a high rate of speed.” We are not prepared to say that the trial court erred in declining to consider this witness as an expert with reference to the subject about which he was called to testify. He does not appear to have been educated in this business, or to have any ‘1 special knowledge and skill in the particular calling to which the inquiry relates.” Goldstein v. Black, 50 Cal., 462. In its second assignment of error appellant complains, that the court erred in refusing to permit it to prove by the witness J. G. Williams, conductor of the train at the time of the injury, that “ ordinarily the defendant keeps its track in good condition.” This language, as we interpret it, imports that the company is in the habit of keeping its track in good condition. The court correctly held such evidence to be immaterial. Another portion of the bill of exceptions raising the assignment indicates that the purpose of appellant’s counsel might have been to prove that the defendant exercised ordinary care ‘1 in building up low joints and in keeping its track in good condition.” To this end the witness was asked to state “ whether or not the defendant was ordinarily careful in building up low joints and in keeping its track in good condition ?” The answer to this question, in our opinion, could but have expressed the opinion of the witness as to the exercise of ordinary care by the defendant. The question of ordinary care vel non is one peculiarly of fact, to be determined by the jury, and not of opinion to be fixed by a witness. The general rule applies here, that “ witnesses must testify to facts and not to opinions.” We do not think that appellant can reasonably complain of the action of the court in permitting the appellee to prove that “ fast mail trains on well ballasted roads could run safety at the rate of sixty miles an hour.” In an inquiry of this kind, involving as it did the rate of speed at which the train was running at the time of the accident, it was not improper that the jury should be made acquainted with all the different conditions under which a train could be operated with greater or less rapidity. The court did not err in permitting plaintiff to testify as to the length of time he had been out of employment. There is no merit in appellant’s proposition that such proof -was without basis in plaintiff’s pleading. The petition averred that on account of the injuries he was “ confined to his bed for the space of about three months,” and u that by reason thereof he has been disabled and prevented from pursuing his occupation.” Appellant complains of the refusal of the court to grant the following special instruction asked by it: “ If the jury should determine from the evidence that the cause of the wreck, if you should find that there was a wreck, was what the witnesses term a low joint, and if you further find that low joints are common to railroads generally, which fact was known, or could have been by plaintiff by the exercise of ordinary care, plaintiff will be held to have assumed any risk that may have arisen from said low joint, and can not recover.” This instruction was property rejected. The injury complained of was due to a derailment of the train. If this derailment is to be ascribed to a low joint, there is no evidence that low joints of such a character “ are common to railroads generally.” It is quite elementary that an instruction should be refused unless it rests upon evidence. Besides, the instruction is subject to the criticism that it gives undue prominence to a special feature of the evidence as indicating contributory negligence. Railway v. Shearer, 1 Texas Civ. App., 343. Appellant in its fifth assignment of error complains of the rejection by the court of its following special instruction: “ It is the duty of a railway company to use ordinary care in the construction and maintenance of its roadway, and to keep it in a reasonably safe condition for proper use. It was the duty of plaintiff to conform to the reasonable and known rules and orders of the defendant regulating the rate of speed at which trains should be propelled over its roadway; and if you believe that defendant’s roadway was in a reasonably safe condition, and that its trains with safety might have been propelled over its said railway at a reasonable rate of speed, not in excess of the rate prescribed by said company, and that plaintiff of his own accord propelled said train over said roadbed at a higher rate of speed than was required of him by said company, and that such increased rate of speed caused or contributed to the cause of the derailment of the engine or' train by reason of which plaintiff may have sustained injury, you will find for defendant. ’ ’ The instruction was properly refused: First. The charge of the court had sufficiently guarded the rights of the defendant on its plea of contributory negligence. The court had instructed the jury, that “ where a person enters into the service of a railway company he assumes all the risks ordinarily incident to the service in which he engages, and he can not recover for an injury received in such service unless the injury be caused by the negligence of the company, and without fault on his part contributing thereto.” Again : “ Unless you believe that the alleged injury was caused by negligence on the part of the defendant’s agents having charge and maintenance of its roadbed, without fault on the part of plaintiff contributing thereto, you should find for the defendant.” Again: “ If the plaintiff’s injuries were caused by his own negligence, and not by reason of a defective track, as alleged, or if you believe that the plaintiff, in running his engine over said track, himself failed to use that care which a person of ordinary prudence would have used with the knowledge possessed by him, and that such want of care on his part contributed to the alleged injury, you will find for the defendant.” Second. The special instruction, in effect, included the proposition, that the fact of running at a greater speed than was permitted by the rules of the company was of itself negligence. This would have been in contravention of the rule forbidding the trial court to say, in the absence of statutory declaration, that any particular act or omission constitutes negligence. Railway v. Lee, 70 Texas, 501; Railway v. Roberts, ante, p. 111. A careful inspection of the court’s charge constrains us to dissent from appellant’s very general assignment of error, that the charge does not “ present the law applicable to the case, and does not present all the questions material to a correct determination of the case.” We are thus brought to consider the question of fact presented in the several concluding assignments and propositions of appellant, namely: Did the evidence justify the verdict? There is no controversy with reference to the extent and gravity of the injuries sustained by the appellee. We have scrutinized the very voluminous statement of facts, and concluded, as already indicated, that the derailment of the train, and the consequent injuries sustained by the appellee, are most reasonably to be ascribed to a low joint of unusual character in appellant’s track; that this low joint might have been avoided or corrected by a proper inspection of the track, which appellant failed to give to it; and while there was a sharp conflict in the evidence with reference to the speed at which the appellee was operating the engine, there was sufficient testimony to warrant the finding by the jury that he was not guilty of contributory negligence. The judgment is therefore affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 24, 1893. A motion for rehearing in this case was overruled.","The Fort Worth & Denver City Railway Company v. Robert Thompson. No. 417. 1. Evidence—Expert Witness.—In order to testify as an expert, a witness must have special knowledge and skill in the particular calling to which the inquiry relates. One who is a lawyer by profession is not qualified as an expert to testify as to the rate of speed at which a particular train could be run with safety, by reason of the fact that while employed as a claim agent by a railway company he had casually acquired some knowledge of engines, and of their operation on the road. 2. Evidence Not Material—General Condition of Railway Track. Where the action is against a railway company for an injury caused by defect in its track, evidence that the company ordinarily keeps its track in good condition is not material. 3. Evidence—Opinion of Witness as to Care.—The question whether or not the defendant was ordinarily careful in building up low joints and keeping its track in good condition, is objectionable, as calling only for the opinion of the witness as to the exercise of ordinary care. 4. Evidence—Safe Speed of Train.—Where the suit is by an employe against the railway company for personal injuries sustained, and defendant pleads contributory negligence by plaintiff in running his train at too high a rate of speed, it is proper to acquaint the jury with the different conditions under which trains can be operated with greater or less rapidity by proof showing that fast mail trains on well ballasted roads can be run at sixty miles per hour. 5. Evidence — Allegata and Probata.—Under an allegation in plaintiff's petition, that on account of the injuries sustained he was confined to his bed for about three months, and that by reason thereof he has been disabled and prevented from pursuing his occupation, evidence is admissible showing the length of time he had been out of employment. 6. Charge of Court Without Evidence.—Where the injury complained ■of resulted from a low joint in the railway track, an instruction that plaintiff, an employe of the railway company, assumed such risk if he knew or might have known by the exercise of ordinary care that low joints were commonto railways generally, is properly refused in the absence of proof that such low joints are common. 7. Charge of Court—Special Instruction Not Necessary.—Where the court’s charge has properly guarded the rights of the defendant on its plea of contributory negligence, an instruction requested by defendant repeating the law on that subject is properly refused. 8. Charge of Court — Negligence. — It is error to instruct that the fact of running a train at a greater speed than is permitted by the rules of the railway company, is of itself negligence; as this contravenes the rule forbidding the trial court to say, in the absence of statutory declaration, that any particular act or omission constitutes negligence.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This action was brought by appellee in the usual form of trespass to try title, to recover possession of a half-section of school land situated in Hardeman County. Appellant answered by plea of not guilty. There was a trial by a jury, with the verdict in favor of appellee. The record contains a very meager statement of facts— but a skeleton, in fact, which indicates that much of its substance was lost in the preparation; many things called for and directed to be inserted having been omitted. In this unsatisfactory state of the record, we doubt if appellant could require us to pass upon questions which depend for their solution upon an investigation of the statement of facts. We think, however, that enough is stated, in a general way, to warrant the following conclusions: 1. On the 7th day of April, 1890, appellee, a single man, actually settled upon the land in controversy with a view to the acquisition of title by purchase from the State under the Act of 1887, amended in 1889, providing for the sale of school lands. 2. He continued to reside upon this land until about August, 1890, when he was ejected by a writ of restitution, issued out of the County Court of Hardeman County on a judgment therein rendered, in an action of forcible entry and detainer pending on appeal from the Justice Court, in favor of appellant. 3. On the 29th day of May, 1890, appellant and appellee made separate applications to purchase this land from the State. 4. Appellant never actually settled on the land until after appellee was dispossessed by the writ of restitution in August; though prior to the settlement of appellee lie had, in the year 1888, enclosed and put in cultivation about 100 acres of the land, when he settléd on an adjoining tract, supposing that he was upon the land in controversy. After learning of his mistake, which was sometime prior to the settlement of appellee, he did not move on the land until the time stated above. 5. It does not appear that either of the applications to purchase was accepted or rejected. The important question in this case arises upon the exclusion from the evidence of a certified copy of the judgment of the County Court under which the writ of restitution mentioned in the conclusions of fact was issued. This copy of the judgment was offered by appellant in bar of this action as res adjudicata. The certified copy is not found in the bill of exceptions nor in the statement of facts; but it is recited in the bill of exceptions, that this judgment was rendered in a suit of forcible entry and detainer, in which John T. Richardson was adjudged to be guilty of forcible entry and detainer against F. J. Westmoreland, in making said entry on the 7th day of April, 1890, upon the land in controversy. This testimony was excluded on the objection, that the suit of forcible entry and detainer was pending on appeal in the Court of Appeals. We are of opinion that this objection should not have been sustained. Thompson v. Griffin, 69 Texas, 143; Rev. Stats., arts. 2461, 2462. The question of difficulty is, whether, notwithstanding the insufficiency of the objection, material error was committed in excluding the evidence. Beyond the statement that Richardson was adjudged guilty of making said forcible entry on the 7th day of April, 1890, we are not informed by the record what issue was tried in the forcible entry and detainer suit. The statute defines a forcible entry to be an entry without the consent of the person having the actual possession. Art. 2441. It may be that Westmoreland was, by virtue of having 100 acres of the land enclosed, held to be in the actual possession, and that Richardson, "" having entered without his consent, was on that ground alone adjudged to be guilty. It may be that under the complaint filed in that case the issue sought to be litigated in this suit could not have been tried. The question submitted for determination in this action of trespass to try title was, whether at the date of the respective applications to purchase the land from the State, appellee or appellant was an actual bona fide settler within the meaning of the Act of 1887, and the amended Act of 1889, which made actual settlement a prerequisite to the acquisition by purchase from the State of the land in controversy. If it be conceded that this issue was triable in the action of forcible entry and detainer, it is not made to appear in any way by this record that it was the issue actually tried therein. Our conclusion is, that in the state of the record brought here by appellant, we would not be warranted in reversing the judgment on account of the exclusion of this evidence. Reddin v.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. There was error in the court’s charge, given without qualification, that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiffs and defendants Crosby, Hills, White, and the Campbell Real Estate Company, and in refusing to charge that as to title by limitation the burden was upon the defendants setting up such title. The assignments of error upon these questions ought to be sustained. The pleadings and the evidence placed all the parties above named in the position of plaintiffs against defendants John Evans, Allen Blocker, W. Gr. Warren, Peter Allen, Charles Dickens, and Fred Hazzard, who pleaded not guilty and limitation of ten years. The court instructed the jury that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiffs T. J. Beall, executor, and Frank Olds, and the defendants Campbell Real Estate Company, Alvord White, J. F. Crosby, and W. S. Hills, to establish by a preponderance of proof the right to recover against the other defendants, naming them. The charge then proceeds to instruct the jury that all the parties had agreed that the title to the land in controversy was in the plaintiffs Beall, executor, and Olds, and the defendants the Campbell Real Estate Company, White, Crosby, and Hills, for the interests respectively claimed by each in their pleadings, unless the other defendants had shown themselves entitled to the same under their pleadings and proof. The jury were then directed to find for Beall, executor, Olds, the Campbell Real Estate Company, White, Crosby, and Hills, for the land claimed by them respectively, unless they should find that the other defendants were entitled to the same under instructions afterwards to be given. The court then charged upon the plea of ten years limitation set up by these defendants, and that if the jury were satisfied it was established they were instructed to find for them. The court also charged upon the title of these defendants by purchase from one Gillett by Evans. Beall, executor, and Olds claimed six-eighths of the land — block 37 in the city of El Paso — an undivided interest; Crosby and Hills each claimed one-eighth undivided interest in all of the block north of the acequia running through it; and the Campbell Real Estate Company and Alvord White each claimed one-eighth undivided interest in the block south of the acequia; all of them disclaiming as to the six-eighths interest claimed by Beall, executor, and Olds, and asking judgment by cross-bill against Evans and other defendants claiming with him. It was agreed that the record title to the block was in plaintiffs and defendants joining with them in the suit against the other defendants, except so far as the same is affected by deeds from John S. Gillett to John Evans, and deeds from Evans and others to other parties to the suit; but it was stipulated that the agreement was not to affect or impair any rights which defendants may set up and establish under their various pleas of the statute of limitations. The charge of the court was erroneous in so far as it put the burden of proof upon the plaintiffs and the defendants joining with them in the suit against the other defendants on their plea of limitation. On this plea the onus was upon the defendants pleading it. The charge nowhere relieved plaintiffs of this burden. The testimony was uncertain and conflicting upon the issue of limitation, and required a verdict to ascertain its effect. The verdict was for defendants pleading limitation; and for aught that appears, it turned upon the instructions upon the burden of proof. A charge was asked by appellants, which was intended to correct the error, as follows: “ The burden of proof in this case as to their title and limitation is on defendant Evans and those claiming with him by limitation, and you will not find in favor of Evans or said defendants unless the proof preponderates in favor of said Evans and said defendants under the general instructions given.” This instruction is not accurate, as the burden of proof was upon appellants as to appellees’ title other than limitation; but it was sufficient to call the attention of the court to the necessity of shifting the burden to appellees upon their plea of limitation. The error complained of is reversible. Cunningham v. Frandtzen, 26 Texas, 34; Clark v. Hills, 67 Texas, 149. The court instructed the jury, that if William Pierson re-entered and took possession of any part of said land by and through his tenants, Mrs. ticottens, Wesley Owens, or any other tenant, then limitation would cease to run in favor of defendants to all the land not actually occupied or cultivated , used or enjoyed, and defendants’ possession would be broken as to all the land not so occupied and enjoyed. This charge can not be approved. There was evidence tending to show that Pierson put parties in possession of the land as his tenants. This would interrupt the constructive possession of Evans to all the land not in actual possession, if he, Pierson, had the title thereto superior to the title of Evans, because the superior title draws to it the constructive possession when there is actual possession under it. This possession under the superior title would not be defeated by mere enjoyment. The error in the charge resulted doubtless from oversight in the use of the disjunctive “ or ” instead of the copulative “ and.” Possession under a junior or inferior title, to defeat that of the superior title, must be actual, and only such part of the premises as is in actual possession can be claimed by it. Parker v. Baines, 65 Texas, 606. The charge of the court upon the character of possession required to sustain the plea of limitation, though in the main correct, was not as full as it should have been. To set the statute in motion under the ten years limitation, the possession must be visible, distinct, notorious, continued, and hostile for the full period of ten consecutive years while the statute was in force; it must be an actual, visible appropriation of the land, under claim of right inconsistent with the rights of the true owner, and must disseize the owner, and the claim must be of the land in suit. When limitation is set up by one tenant in common against another, it must not only amount to an ouster of the other joint tenant, but it must be of such a character and under such claim as will give notice to them of the intention to claim the whole.

Reversed and remanded.","T. J. Beall, Executor, et al. v. John Evans et al. No. 11. 1. Burden of Proof — Limitation—Charge.—In an action of trespass to try title, when the defendants pleaded limitation and there was testimony tending to support it, the court having charged the jury that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiff's, it was error to refuse a charge asked by the plaintiffs that as to the defense of limitation the burden was upon the defendants pleading it. 2. Possession Under Junior Title. — Possession under a junior or inferior title, to defeat the superior title, must be actual, and only such part of the premises as may be in actual possession can be claimed by it. Mere enjoyment is not sufficient. The superior title draws to it the constructive possession when there is actual possession under it. 3. Adverse Possession Under Statute of Ten Years. — To set the statute of ten years limitation in operation, the possession must be an actual, visible appropriation of the land for the full period of ten consecutive years, under claim of right adverse to the true owner. 4. Possession as Against Tenant in Common. — Possession by one joint tenant as against another, to be adverse, must not only be an ouster of such other, but of such a nature as to give notice of the intention to claim the whole.

The court erred in that portion of the charge given to the jury announcing that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiffs and upon the defendants Crosby, Hills, White, and Campbell Real Estate Company; first, because it gave undue prominence to a burden that did not rest wholly upon said parties; and second, because, under the agreements as to evidence in this case, the burden of proof was upon the defendants Evans, Blocker, Warren, Allen, Dickens, and Hazzard; and in refusing the special charge asked by plaintiffs and defendants Crosby, Hills, White, and Campbell Real Estate Company, which was intended to correct the erroneous charge of the court upon the burden of proof. 2 Am. and Eng.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. In September, 1885, one William Still undertook to purchase from the State, through the Land Board, 333 acres of school land situated in Wichita County. He applied to purchase it as agricultural land, and obligated himself to live upon it as an actual settler, as provided by the law then in force. The sale to him in accordance with the regulations of the Land Board was not in compliance with the Act of 1883, and did not confer title upon him, among other reasons, because the sale was not made in the county or district where the land was situated, as required under that act. He also failed to become an actual settler. The State v. Opperman, 74 Texas, 136; Martin v. McCarty, 74 Texas, 128. In March, 1887, he conveyed this land by warranty deed to appellant James, who assumed the payment of the notes executed by Still to the State. James likewise failed to become an actual settler, and in February, 1889, conveyed the same by a deed with covenant of general warranty to appellee J. H. Lamb and one Edwards. Lamb and Edwards paid James $200 cash, and executed four negotiable promissory notes for $294.05 each, and assumed the payment of the original Still notes, in consideration of this conveyance from James. Soon thereafter appellee Lamb acquired the interest of Edwards, ■ and became an actual settler upon the land and continued to reside thereon. When the act, passed April 8, 1889 (page 50), giving preference in the sale of school land to the actual settler took effect, he was residing upon the land. Soon thereafter he seems to have applied to the State, under the law then in force, to purchase this land; and this was followed by a suit to recover from appellant James the $200 previously paid him, and to have the notes, then in the possession of the Panhandle National Bank, cancelled. As grounds of recovery, he charged that appellant James had fraudulently represented himself to have title when he had none; that he had been deceived and defrauded in the transaction; and also alleged a breach of the covenant of general warranty. These allegations of fraud were wholly unsustained by the proof, and that issue was not submitted to the jury. The State intervened in this suit (presumptively at the instance of Lamb), and obtained a cancellation, as against appellant James, of the original contract of purchase made in the name of William Still. Appellee Lamb recovered judgment against James for the $200, and against appellant bank for the cancellation of the notes. From that judgment this appeal is prosecuted. The court submitted as the measure of damages for a breach of the warranty, the purchase money paid and secured to appellant James, as set forth above. In his original petition, appellee Lamb alleged that in order to protect himself in the use, occupation, and enjoyment of the land, and to save the improvements he had placed thereon, he had been compelled to purchase and acquire title to the same from the State of Texas. In his first supplemental petition, in reply to the answer of appellant James, he alleged that he was in possession of the land described in his petition, holding the same from and under the State of Texas and pursuant to the law of the land, and not under the void title sold him by James. The only assignments of error presented by appellants which seem to us to be well taken relate to the question of the measure of damages. The correctness of the rule followed in the trial below is not questioned in cases where the title has failed and the purchaser has lost the land. It seems to us, however, that this rule is not applicable to the case here submitted, inasmuch as appellee Lamb admits in his pleadings that he has acquired a title from the State, which we understand to mean that he has acquired such title as appellant James purported to convey to him. We are of opinion that the loss which he has sustained, if any, in securing by purchase from the State such right to the land as he would have acquired under the deed from James had the original purchase of Still been valid, is the true measure of his damages, as compensation for this loss will place him in statu quo. His purpose, as contemplated by all parties, in acquiring the land in the first instance seems to have been that he might settle upon it and enjoy it as a home, and after making full payment to the State, receive a patent. To the extent that the failure of the title which James’ deed purported to convey rendered the accomplishment of this result more onerous and expensive to appellee, appellant James should respond in damages on his warranty. Appellee Lamb relies upon the cases of Wheeler v. Styles, 28 Texas, 240, and Rodgers v. Daily, 46 Texas, 578, as authority for the proposition, that where the land sold turns out to be vacant public domain, the vendee may resist the payment of the purchase money, or recover it back when paid, without a surrender of the possession to the vendor, and at the same time acquire from the State a title to the vacant land. In each of those cases the contract of purchase was executory, there being only a bond for title and no covenant of warranty; hence the correctness of the rule as therein applied is not questioned. Where the contract is executed and a warranty of title is relied upon, as in this case, in the absence of fraud or other circumstances which would authorize a cancellation of the contract, we think it must be held that the covenant of warranty is a suffieient consideration for the money paid and notes executed to obtain the warranty deed, and that the proper remedy is for damages for a breach of the warranty. In the case of McClelland v. Moore, 48 Texas, 363, there was such a conveyance and covenant; and the land sold had been surveyed, but the certificate by virtue of which it had been surveyed was not returned to the General Land Office within the time required, and the survey , was therefore forfeited and the land became subject to reappropriation. Thevendee had it located and surveyed by virtue of a certificate belonging-to him, and subsequently obtained a patent for it. In that case the rule was announced and applied, that “ when the covenantee purchases the-paramount title, the measure of damages is the actual loss thereby sustained; it is incumbent on the purchaser, in order to recover more than nominal damages, to prove the amount paid by him to extinguish the paramount title.” We think this rule should be followed in measuringappellees’ damages; compensation for the loss sustained being the desideratum of all the rules. For the error of the court in submitting to the jury an incorrect rule-for measuring the damages, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 31, 1893.","Ashby S. James et al. v. J. H. Lamb et al. No. 82. 1. Covenants of Warranty—Measure of Damages for Breach of-Where land is conveyed by deed of general warranty, and the title thereto fails by reason of the original sale thereof by the State proving void, and the vendee in such warranty deed, who is in possession, and who had assumed the payment of purchase money due the State thereon by his grantor, himself purchases the land from the State, the measure of his damages on the warranty, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the grantor, is not the purchase price paid the grantor, but the loss, if any, sustained in thus perfecting the title. 2. Cases Distinguished.—The cases of Wheeler v. Styles, 28 Texas, 240, and Rodgers v.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On March 31,1883, the Legislature passed the following act: “Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That all surveys and patents by virtue of headright or bounty warrants issued under special laws enacted after March 3, 1870, and prior to April 1, 1876, to which there is no valid legal objection other than that such special laws are supposed to be in conflict with the Constitution then in force, are hereby validated and confirmed and declared to be as binding upon the State as they otherwise would be if such special laws had been permitted by the Constitution; provided, that if such headright or bounty certificate had been forfeited under existing laws by location and surveys on appropriated land, this act shall not be construed to revive the same; provided further, this act shall only apply to soldiers and heirs and actual settlers of Texas and their vendees to whom lands have been granted.” On September 2, 1889, appellants filed their petition in the District Court of Denton County, alleging that on the 19th day of February, 1873, the Legislature of the State of Texas passed a special act granting to William J, Russell a certificate for 640 acres of land for his having participated in the campaign against Bexar in 1835, and also containing the necessary allegations that said Russell had in fact participated in said campaign so as to entitle him to said certificate. That this certificate was located on the land in controversy and patent was issued to said Russell on the 20th day of September, 1873. Appellants’ petition also showed that said William J. Russell died on the 5th day of November, 1881, and that they are his heirs, and they seek to recover of defendants, who are alleged to be trespassers, the land so patented. Delivered December 13, 1892. The court below sustained a general demurrer to appellants’ petition, holding, as we infer from the briefs of counsel, that the land having been patented to William J. Russell himself, and he being dead at the time of the passage of the Act of 1883, his heirs would have no claim to the land under said act. As an original proposition, the proper construction of this act would present questions of considerable difficulty; but since the decision of this case in the court below our Supreme Court has fully construed this statute, and, as we think correctly, held in such cases the heirs would be entitled to the land.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Defendant in error, MacGregor, brought this suit against the plaintiffs in error, the railway company, and Yoakum and MacNamara, its receivers, to recover a tract of 41 acres of land near the city of Houston, and damages caused by the construction of the railway across it. The defendants filed pleadings for the purpose of obtaining a condemnation of a strip 50 feet wide across the tract for its use as a right of way. Upon a trial a verdict was rendered in favor of the company condemning the right of way, and in favor of the plaintiff for $4000 as the value of the land thus taken and damages to the remainder of the tract resulting from the location of the road upon it. The evidence as to the value of the portion of the land occupied by the defendant as right of way, and as to the injury to the value of the remainder of the tract caused by the road upon it, was conflicting. There was ample testimony to sustain the verdict of the jury, and we conclude that the damages amounted to $4000. The only questions of law presented relate to the admission of evidence at the trial. The first, second, and fourth assignments of error complain of the overruling of objections to questions asked plaintiff while testifying as a witness. The objection was that the questions called for the opinion of the witness as to the extent to which the property had been damaged. A witness may give his opinion concerning the value of the property; and in this case it was competent for the plaintiff to state his opinion as to the value of the land without the road upon it, and the extent to which such value had been diminished by the road. This we understand the witness to have done throughout his testimony. It is not regular, in suits for damages, to ask witnesses to state the amount of damage which has resulted from given acts, because the witness may give his conclusion based upon improper standards, or upon facts which should be submitted to the jury. For this reason the form of the questions asked was objectionable. They should have called for the opinion of the witness as to the value of the property, and as to any deterioration in such value resulting from the maintaining of the road upon the land, rather than his general conclusion as to the amount of the damage he had sustained. But, as above pointed out, the witness answered as to value, and gave his opinion upon that alone. The error was therefore harmless. The evidence referred to in the third assignment, as to the purposes for which the land was valuable, was properly admitted. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. J. M.Curtis and Dortha E. Swain, appellants, brought this suit of trespass to try title, January 13, 1886, in the District Court of Parker County, to recover certain realty, together with the improvements thereon, situated in the city of Weatherford. At the time of the trial, W. H. Wilson, George A. McCall, L. W. Christian, Jennie Christian, and Jim L. McCall, a minor, through his guardian ad litem, George A. McCall, were defendants. Among other matters, the defendants relied upon the pleas of not guilty, of the statute of ten years limitation, and of improvements in good faith. A trial by jury on May 22, 1889, resulted in a verdict for the defendants, and a judgment accordingly, from which this appeal is-prosecuted. As a counter-proposition to all the assignments of error, appellees contend that they were entitled to a verdict under their plea .of not guilty. They assert, that the plaintiffs failed to show title from the State, and that it nowhere appears that the parties claimed under a common source. The appellants do not deraign title from the sovereignty The source of their title is a deed from William M. Green to John W. Curtis, executed in 1857. It is undisputed that the appellants are the children and heirs at law of said Curtis. In their plea setting up improvements in good faith, appellees alleged, that they claim under one Jane L. Sikes, and that in the year 1859 John W. Curtis died and willed to Jane L. Sikes the property in controversy. It is thus apparent that both appellants and appellees claim under Curtis, and consequently under the deed from Green, and that this contention of appellees can not be sustained. A very material, perhaps” the controlling, issue in the case arose out of the plea of limitation. It was proved by numerous witnesses for the appellees that Mi'S. Jane L. Sikes, under whom they claim, occupied continuously and enjoyed the property in controversy, claiming it in her own separate right, for a period beginning as early as 1859, and ending at the date of her death in August, 1885. Such being the state of the evidence for the defendants, the plaintiff J. M. Curtis offered to prove by his own deposition that he was in Weatherford in 1877, and then had frequent conversations about the property in controversy, in which conversations Mrs. Sikes stated, that “ the property was purchased by John W. Curtis, plaintiff’s father, and with his own money; that she had been advised by attorneys that she could hold it during her lifetime, but that at her death she would as soon the plaintiffs would have it as any one; that she only claimed a life-estate in the property.” To the statements made by Mrs. Sikes in these conversations, appellees objected, “ because the declarations purported to have been made by her through whom defendants claim, and the witness was a party to the suit brought against a part of the defendants, who were the legatees of Jane L. Sikes.” Appellants assign as error the action of the court in sustaining this objection and excluding the evidence. The objection is predicated upon article 2248 of the Revised Statutes, which reads as follows: “ In actions by or against executors, administrators, or guardians, in which judgment may be rendered for or against them as such, neither party shall be allowed to testify against the others as to any transaction with or statement by the testator, intestate, or ward, unless called to testify thereto by the opposite party; and the provisions of this article shall extend to and include all actions by or against the heirs or legal representatives of a decedent arising out of any transaction with such decedent.” It has been held that the language of this article can not be so interpreted as to include “legatees.” Persons of this character do not come within the designation “ executors, administrators, guardians, heirs, or legal representatives.” The language of the statute will not by implication be extended to include persons of a class not designated therein. Newton v. Newton, 77 Texas, 511; Mitchell v. Mitchell, 80 Texas, 111. The specific objection, not referring to any of the persons named in the statute, but to legatees, was erroneously sustained, and bearing as it did upon a material issue in this case, requires a reversal of the judgment. The plaintiffs having dismissed their suit against Jim L. McCall and Jennie Christian, the court did not err in permitting the remaining defendants, on such dismissal, to make the parties named defendants in the cause. This action was in the discretion of the court, as the additional parties claimed an interest in the property. Rev. Stats., art. 1209. Nor did the court err in admitting the declarations of Jane L. Sikes showing the character of her claim, and that her possession was adverse. These declarations, contemporaneous with her possession and explanatory thereof, were admitted, with the limitations by the court, that they were not to be considered as evidence of title, but solely for the purpose stated. For this purpose they were clearly competent. Harnage v. Berry, 43 Texas, 567. The paper purporting to be the will of Mrs. Turner, formerly Mrs. Sikes, having been stricken from the record by an order of our Supreme Court, the questions relating thereto and stated in appellants’ brief will not be considered by us. We find no merit in the remaining assignments of appellants, save in so far as the questions arising out of them may be affected by the error already pointed out, and on account of which the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This is an appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Denton County, for the sum of $615.28, rendered February 28, 1889, in favor of appellee against appellant. The suit was for damages alleged to have been caused by the negligence and default of defendant, a common carrier, in the transportation by rail of 143 head of cattle, shipped by plaintiff on the 14th day of June, 1888, from Den-ton, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois. Two head of cattle, worth $50 and $40 respectively, are alleged to have been crippled and rendered worthless by negligent switching of cars at Chetopa and Sedalia. A delay of twenty-four hours in their transportation was alleged to have caused deterioration in the weight and grade and decline in the market price of the cattle to the extent of $517.20. Plaintiff also claimed $33 for extra feed bills caused by the delay. The damages found'by the court were itemized as follows: “ (1) The steer lost at Chetopa, $50; (2) the steer lost at Sedalia, $40; (3) the extra feed at Sedalia, $33; (4) the difference between the price obtained for said cattle on the 19th day of June, 1889, to-wit, $4.40 per 100 pounds, and the price said cattle could have been sold for on the 18th day of June, 1889, to-wit, $4.65 per 100 pounds, said difference being 25 cents on the 100 pounds, the weight of the 141 head at Chicago, to-wit, 147,280 pounds, at 25 cents, $368.20; (5) amount lost in weight on the fifth day said cattle were in transit, to-wit, 2820 pounds, at $4.40 per 100 pounds, $124.08; total, $615.28.” The defendant, in addition to the general issue, pleaded specially that the plaintiff had wholly failed, in compliance with its contract of shipment, to give notice of the loss as therein stipulated. By this contract the plaintiff agreed, that “as a condition precedent to his right to any damages or any loss or injury to his said stock during the transportation thereof, or previous to loading thereof for shipment, he will give notice in writing of his claim therefor to some general officer of defendant, or to its nearest station agent, or to the agent at the delivering station of the railway which carries the stock to destination, or to the nearest station agent or general officer of such delivering road, before said stock is removed from the point of shipment or from the place of destination, and before such stock is mingled with other stock, and one day after the delivery of such stock at its point of destination and before the same have been removed or intermingled with other stock, to the end that such claim may be fully and fairly investigated; and that a failure to comply with the terms of this clause shall be a complete bar to any recovery of any and all such claims. The written notice herein provided for can not, and shall not, be waived by any person except such general officer or station agent, and by him only in writing.” The defendant, in connection with this contract, alleged, that it had stations and station agents at Chetopa, Kansas, and Sedaba and Hannibal, Missouri; and that the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Bail way Company, its connecting line which transported the cattle from Hannibal to Chicago, Illinois, their destination, had stations and station agents and its general offices and officers in Chicago. The trial court, hearing the case without a jury, held this contract unreasonable and invalid, and appellant complains of this conclusion as error. The record contains no statement of facts. The court’s conclusions of fact, however, with reference to the contract, are as follows: “1. I find that said written and printed contract, under which plaintiff shipped said cattle, nowhere gives the names of any of their agents or general officers along their line of road over which plaintiff shipped said cattle. That plaintiff knew of no agent or general office of defendant at Chicago. Got a pass there of some man to come home on. “2. That defendant had a station and station agent at Sedaba, Missouri, and Hannibal, Missouri, and a ticket agent at Chicago, Hlinois, from whom plaintiff procured his pass to return to Denton. “ 3. That defendant’s line terminated at Hannibal, Missouri, where it connected with the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway, to which line said cattle were transferred at that point and transported by said Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway Company to their destination at Chicago, Ibinois; and that at Chicago said Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway had a station and station agent, whom plaintiff saw and talked with while in Chicago, and also that the general offices and officers of said Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Bail way Company were also in Chicago.” The concluding two of the foregoing findings were added by the court at the request of the defendant. The contract in question as pleaded is upon its face unreasonable. It fails to state the name of the agent in Chicago to whom the notice was to be given. It required the plaintiff to leave his stock, on the arrival of the cars at the point of destination, and within twenty-four hours to seek and find the person to whom notice should be given, without indieating to him whether or where such person would be found, or at what hour he would be found at his place of business. It may well be conceived that a large corporation in an immense city has numerous agents engaged in different departments of its business other than the particular agent charged with the duty of investigating claims of the character here in question. We can understand how the shipper, under such circumstances, would interview one after another of these agents, only to be truthfully told by each agent interviewed that he was not authorized to pass upon such a demand. We do not hold that a contract requiring the shipper to give notice is necessarily invalid, but we do hold that it is unreasonable and can not be enforced unless it be made to appear that the person to be notified is so conveniently accessible to the person who is to give the notice as that the latter can reasonably discharge that duty within the time limited by the contract. The burden rests upon the carrier to show that this condition exists, either by the terms of the contract indicating that the requisite information is thus furnished to the shipper, or that the latter is in fact possessed of such information, from what source soever it may come. See Railway v. Childers, ante, 302, in which Head, Associate Justice, elaborately reviews the decisions of our Supreme Court on this subject. We therefore consider whether, under the facts found by the court, we are at liberty to say that the court below erred in concluding that the contract here relied upon is unreasonable. These facts are that .the defendant company had a ticket agent in Chicago, from whom plaintiff procured his pass to return to Denton, and that the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway Company had also there a station and station agent whom plaintiff saw and talked with while in Chicago. Under the terms of the contract, the plaintiff was required to give notice within twenty-four hours after the arrival of the stock. It does not appear that the transaction and conversations with the agents above mentioned were had within this time. If, in fact, these occurrences did take place within the limit stated, it would seem to follow that the defendant could have proved this fact. So it might well be concluded that, in fact, the shipper had not discovered these agents and that he was unable to discover them until after the lapse of the time within which the notice was required to be given. In any event, the facts stated will not justify us in reversing a finding by the lower court that the defendant had failed to fulfill the task imposed upon it of showing that the contract relied upon by it was reasonable. The appellant in its next assignment of error complains of the fourth item of damages as not justified by the facts found by the court. This contention we sustain. This item, for $368.20, is founded upon the difference between the market value of the cattle as they were actually sold on June 19, 1889, and such market value if they had been sold on June 18, 1889. According to the findings of the court, the cattle left Denton, Texas, about 9 p. m. June 14, and reached Chicago about 7 or 8 o’clock a. m. June 19. If the carrier had used proper diligence, the cattle would have reached Chicago in about four days after their departure, or about 9 p. m. June 18. The cattle market in Chicago usually opened about 9 o’clock a. m. and closed about 12 o’clock m. or 1 p. m. Cattle arriving after the close of market hours would be held over until next day before being sold. It thus appears that the negligence of the carrier did not affect the price of the cattle with reference to the time of their sale. Had they reached Chicago within due time (about 9 o’clock p. m. on June 18th), their arrival would have been too late for the market of that day; nor could they have been sold before they actually were sold during the market hours of the next day, June 19th. The court elsewhere finds that the delay was “ about one day,” and on this finding it evidently predicates the conclusion that the owner was deprived of the market of the 18th of June. We are of opinion that the fixing by the court of the hours of departure from Denton and of arrival in Chicago determines more accurately the duration of the journey, and indicates that there was not a delay of a day nor the consequent loss to the plaintiff of a sale on June 18. We therefore deduct from the amount of the judgment below the fourth item of damages $368.20, and here render judgment for the difference, viz., $247.08, with legal interest Lrom the date of the judgment below. Delivered December 13, 1892. Reformed and rendered.","Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. John H. Paine. No. 723. 1. Carriers of Live Stock — Contract for Notice of Damage Unreasonable. — A contract with a railway company for the shipment of cattle contained a stipulation that as a condition precedent to the shipper’s right to any damages occasioned in the transportation, he should give notice in writing of his claim therefor to the station agent, or a general officer of the road carrying the cattle to their destination, within one day after they arrived there; and that a failure to give such notice should bar any recovery for such damage. Held, that on its face the stipulation was unreasonable and invalid, and that it devolved on the railway company to show that it was reasonable in fact. 2. Same — Evidence not Showing Contract for Notice Reasonable. — Proof that the shipper, while at the point of destination (Chicago), saw and talked with the station agent there of the delivering road, does not conclusively establish that the contract for notice was reasonable; such proof failing to show that the shipper saw such agent within twenty-four hours after arrival of the cattle there. 3. Negligence not Cause of Damage, when. — Where the proof shows that if the cattle had arrived at their destination on time, it would have been after market hours for that day, so that they would necessarily have been held over until the time when they were actually sold on the next day, the negligence of the carrier in failing to get the cattle there on time could not have affected the price received for them.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice This is a suit, in the name of the State of Texas, on a liquor dealer’s bond, to recover the penalty for a breach of the conditions of the bond, that the liquor dealer would not permit to be sold in his place of business malt liquor to any person under the age of twenty-one years. The petition set out the bond, which is dated March 6, 1891, and is conditioned in the terms of the statute. It was alleged that the defendant executed the bond for the purpose of procuring a retail license to sell spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, or medicated bitters capable of producing intoxication, in quantities less than a quart, in the city of Palestine and county of Anderson; and that the license was issued on the 7th day of March, A. D. 1891. The breach of the bond was alleged as follows: 1 ‘ Plaintiff would further show, that notwithstanding the bond and obligation of the said Sol Maier and his sureties as aforesaid, that heretofore, to-wit, on or about the-day of-, 1891, in violation of the bond and obligation of said Sol Maier to the State of Texas, one Albert Maier, who was then and there the agent and employe of Sol Maier, was then and there acting as such, did sell or give, or permit to be given, to Rob Rodgers spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, or medicated bitters capable of producing intoxication, the said Rob Rodgers then and there being a minor under the age of twenty-one years, in violation of the said bond to the State as aforesaid; whereby the said defendants have become liable to the State of Texas, for the use and benefit of the county of Anderson, in the penal sum of $500, for which sum the State here sues.” Trial was had without a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of the State of Texas, for the use and benefit of the county of Anderson, against the defendants, Sol Maier, as principal, and A. A. Stevens and J. F. Pells, as sureties, for the sum of $500, the penalty sued for. Defendants filed motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial, which were overruled by the court. The facts are, as found by the court below, as follows: “That after giving the bond set out in the petition, defendant Maier kept a saloon in Palestine, Anderson County, Texas, for the sale of alcoholic, vinous, and malt liquors, and medicated bitters capable of producing intoxication. That on the-day of September, 1891, his clerk and bartender, Albert Maier, sold or gave to Rob Rodgers, a minor under the age of twenty-one years, a glass of beer, the kind of which is not shown except as it may be inferred. The facts are, that the minor entered the saloon in company with several persons, one of whom, an adult, ordered beer for them all, whereupon the bartender placed upon the bar a glass of beer for each of the party. While the glass put out for the minor was still on the bar, his father, who had seen him go into the saloon, entered and called to the clerk not to let his son drink the beer, stating that he was a minor. The clerk did not hear at first what was said, and advanced to where the father was standing, leaving the minor at the other end of the bar, and asked the father what he said, upon which the latter repeated his statement. To this the clerk replied, that he could not help it; that the other gentlemen ordered the beer. The evidence conflicts as whether the clerk could have then prevented the minor from drinking the beer, and I hold it to be immaterial whether he could or not. The minor, not seeing his father, drank the beer. The bartender refused to take pay for the beer which the minor drank. Defendant Maier was not present, and did not know of the transaction. He had instructed the clerk not to sell liquor to minors, nor allow them about the saloon. From the conduct of the parties at the time, and other facts stated, I conclude that the beer was malt liquor, capable of producing intoxication.” 1. The purpose of a motion in arrest of judgment is to present to a court after trial such matters as before trial might have been presented by demurrer. Machon v. Randle, 66 Texas, 282. The allegation in the petition, that the agent and employe of Sol Maier, acting as such, sold the liquor, is sufficient to show a breach of the bond in that respect. The bond was set out in full in the petition, and it was alleged that it was executed for the purpose of procuring a license to sell liquors in the city of Palestine, in the county of Anderson; it was also alleged, that the license was issued, and that in violation of the bond and obligation, the sale was made as alleged. It sufficiently appears from the allegations stated above, that the defendant Sol Maier had executed a bond and had obtained license to do business as a liquor dealer in the city of Palestine, in the county of Anderson, and in the course of such business had sold the liquor in violation of the conditions of the bond. The allegation as to date necessarily showed that it was after the execution of the bond, and was at least good on general demurrer. There was no error in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment. 2. It is contended by counsel for appellants, that because the defendant Sol Maier was not present and did not know of the transaction, and had instructed his clerk not to sell liquors to minors, a breach was not shown of the condition of the bond, that he would not permit liquors to be sold to a minor. When the defendant undertook that he would not permit liquors to be sold to minors in his house or place of business, he obligated himself that liquors should not be so sold; not that he would not knowingly permit them to be sold, but that he would prohibit or prevent its being done. The intent of the defendant to violate the condition of the bond is not to be considered in construing it. By the condition he must not permit nor allow liquors to be sold to a minor in his place of business. He must so conduct his business as to prevent it. If this were a prosecution for a violation of the Penal Code, it would be necessary to show that the sale was knowingly made; but there is no such restriction in the law prescribing the conditions of a liquor dealer’s bond, which is required by ""the civil statutes as a restriction on the right of a person to sell liquors, and to prevent the evils arising therefrom. McGuire v. Glass, 15 S. W. Rep., 127; O’Flinn v. The State, 5 So. Rep., 390. In construing the obligation sued on in this case, no such meaning will be given the word ‘ ‘ permit ” as is attached to it in Harris v. The State, 5 Texas, 15, which was a prosecution upon an indictment under the gambling act, for permitting a faro bank to be kept and exhibited in the defendant’s house. In that case the court held, that by a fair construction of the language of the law, a knowledge of the forbidden fact was a constituent ingredient of the offense; yet there are many offenses for which the principal is criminally liable for the acts of his agent. The case before us is a civil action on a bond which was voluntarily entered into by the defendant, and does not involve the idea of intent that generally enters into acts which are done in violation of a penal statute, and for which there is a criminal prosecution. 3. Proof that the liquor was sold or given by an agent or employe of the defendant to the minor Rob Rodgers was sufficient to show a breach of the bond by the defendant himself, other necessary facts having been shown. The language of the condition of the bond is, that the licensee ‘ ‘ will not sell or permit to be sold,’ ’ which of itself involves the idea of agency. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 3226a, sec. 4. Many of the authorities which are apparently against this position arise from criminal prosecutions, or from the particular language of the statute. The American and English Encyclopedia of Law (volume 11, page 718) collates quite a number of authorities, from which it states the rule to be, that “ a sale of liquor to a minor by an agent, clerk, or bartender of the owner of a saloon or drug store, is a sale by the owner, for which he is liable when it was made in the regular course of the master’s, lawful business, although the sale was made without his knowledge, and in violation of his bona fide instructions to such agent, clerk, or bartender. For a well considered discussion of the question, and a review of the law applicable to the subject, we refer to the case of State v. Kittelle (North Carolina Supreme Court), 15 Southeastern Reporter, 103, in which it was said, that “ the law looks to the responsible. party, the licensee, who has been permitted to carry on the calling, and who is responsible for its proper exercise.” 4. Under the facts found by the court, we are of the opinion that there-was, if not a sale, at least a giving of the beer to the minor. A glass of beer was set out on the bar for him, and he drank it. The fact that the-bartender refused pay for it, after his attention was called to the matter by the father of the boy, can make no difference. People v. Neumann, 48 N. W. Rep., 290; The State v. Best, 12 S. E. Rep., 907. The case of Seigle v. People, cited by appellant, is discussed in the case of People v. Neumann, supra, and while the court rests its decision on the difference between the Illinois statute, which is like ours, and that of Michigan, which goes further and uses the word “furnish” in defining the offense of giving, selling, or furnishing liquor to a minor, the learned judge who delivered the opinion expressed himself as not satisfied with the reasoning of the case. We think the facts in this case bring it clearly within the conditions of the bond. The liquor, upon the order of the adult, was set out upon the bar for the minor, and the minor drank it. 5. The proof was that the bartender sold or gave the minor a glass of beer, and it is contended that this is not sufficient proof that he sold or gave him any spirituous, vinous, or malt liquor, or medicated bitters capable of producing intoxication. We are of the opinion that the limitation, “ capable of producing intoxication,” applies only to “medicated bitters.” Is, then, proof of the sale or gift of “beer” proof of the sale or -gift of “ malt liquors ? But it seems to be well settled that the word “ beer,” in its ordinary sense, denotes a beverage which is intoxicating, and is within the fair meaning of the words 1 ‘ strong or spirituous liquors,” used in statutes regulating the sale of such liquors. 11 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 579; and a number of authorities there cited pro and con. “Beer” is defined to be “a fermented liquor made from any malted grain, with hops and other bitter flavoring matters;” also, as a fermented extract of the roots and other parts of various plants, as spruce, ginger, sassafras, etc. Webster’s Die. Its primary signification is, that it is a malt liquor; and if it is to be understood in a restricted or qualified sense, such as to denote root beer, molasses beer, or persimmon beer, etc., it would be incumbent upon the defendant to show that such is the case. There have been a great many decisions upon the subject, some of them evincing much learning; and in Briffit v. The State, 16 Northwestern Reporter, 39, there will be found a reference to some of them to sustain the view, that the court will take judicial notice that the word “ beer,” when used in court by a witness, means a malt and an intoxicating liquor. It would have been competent for the defendant to have shown that the glass of beer sold or given to the minor was not malt liquor; but having failed to do so, the presumption is that it was such, because it is commonly understood to be such, and words are generally to be understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense. The judgment of the court below will be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 16, 1893. Justice Williams did not sit in this case.","Sol Maier et al. v. The State of Texas. No. 143. 1. Sufficient Petition to Recover Penalty of a Liquor Dealer’s Bond.—When the petition sets out the bond, and the purpose for which it was executed, states that license was issued, and its date, and charges the violation of its conditions by the selling or giving malt liquor to a minor by an employe of the defendant, whereby the defendant became liable to the State, for the use of the county, in the statutory penalty of $500, it is good against a motion in arrest of judgment. 2. Liability of the Licensee. — The fact that the beer was given to the' minor in the absence of the defendant by one of his employes, and against his-express commands, is not a defense. It is not necessary that it should be shown that the sale was knowingly made, and the language of the bond, “ will not sell or permit to be sold,” involves the idea of agency, and the law looks to the responsible party, the licensee, who has been permitted to carry on the business. 3. Selling or Giving Beer.—It seems well settled that the word “ beer,” in its ordinary sense, denotes a beverage which is intoxicating, and is within the. fair meaning of the words “ strong or spirituous liquors,” used in statutes regulating sales. If it is to be understood to denote root beer, molasses beer, or persimmon beer, etc., the defendant must show that such was the case. Appeal from Anderson. Tried below before Hon. F. A. Williams.

The court erred in holding that proof that beer was sold or given to the alleged minor by said employe was sufficient proof that spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors, or medicated bitters capable of producing intoxication, were sold or given to said minor. Webster’s Diet., “ Beer;” Hansberg v. People, 120 Ill., 21; Lathrop v. State, 50 Ind., 555; Klare v. The State, 43 Ind., 435. 3. The judgment is erroneous and unsupported by the evidence, because the conclusions of fact show that the beer drank by the alleged minor was not sold or given to him by the principal in the bond or by his employe, but was given to said minor by another person not an employe of said principal, and without the principal’s permission or knowledge.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Plaintiff brought this suit against the Southern Pacific Company, to recover damages for personal injuries received by him while in the employ of the company as fireman of a pile-driver engine, without fault or negligence on his part. Defendant demurred to the petition, and also pleaded a general denial and contributory negligence. The demurrer was overruled, and trial by jury resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. The overruling of the demurrer has been assigned as error. Substantially stated, as far as necessary, the petition alleges, that at the time of the injury plaintiff was in the employ of defendant as a fireman of a stationary engine on a piledriver car, then and there being operated by defendant in the city of Houston; that said stationary engine was situated near one end of said car, and while plaintiff was engaged in shovelling coal into the said engine, one of the defendant’s employes in charge of one of the locomotive engines then being operated by the defendant, caused said engine and certain cars attached to it to violently jolt and jar said piledriver car, without warning to plaintiff, whereby he was thrown from said car, between the same and another car immediately behind it, and one of his legs was run over by said car and he was injured. That said stationary engine was located very near the end of the car, it being intended that the same should be enclosed in a small house, for the protection in part of defendant’s employes, including the fireman, whose duty it was to shovel coal into the furnace of said engine; that some two or three weeks before said accident happened, said engine had been removed temporarily from said car, in order that the same might be more conveniently used in the removal of a wreck, and in order to take the engine off from said car the rear end of the house enclosing the engine, being the portion next to the end of the car, had been taken out, it having been constructed in such a manner as to be easily taken out and replaced by means of bolts, without injury to the structure of the same:; that previous to said accident, plaintiff had been in the employ of defendant as a fireman in connection with said stationary engine on said piledriver car, for a year or more, and that on a number of occasions during said period said engine had been taken off temporarily from said car and placed on the ground, such removal having been made by taking out the rear end of the house as aforesaid; that on all said occasions when the engine had been returned to said car, the plank forming the rear end of said house, in connection with the narrow sliding doors, also forming a part of the same, had been replaced; that about four days before the occurrence of the accident complained of, the engine was returned to its place on the car, but defendant negligently failed and neglected to replace the end of said house, and negligently permitted said piledriver car to be used without the same being replaced. Said house having no end to it, and there being no projection whatsoever on the sides of the same to which a person could catch hold in case of a jar or jolt, plaintiff was thereby exposed to great and unnecessary danger in passing around said engine and in shovelling coal into the same; that when said jolt and jar occurred, as before alleged, plaintiff did in fact throw his hands against the side of said house, and had there been a projection there, even to the extent of a few inches, which he could have caught hold of, or had the plank constituting the end of said house been replaced as promptly as it had been the custom of defendant theretofore to do, the accident would not have occurred. Plaintiff also averred that defendant had promised to replace said plank forming the end of said house within a very short time, and by its action induced plaintiff to believe that the same would be replaced within a very short time; and that relying on such promise, and on the custom and habit of defendant to replace the end of said house as aforesaid as soon as the engine was returned to the same, plaintiff continued to remain in defendant’s employ, and discharge the duties of a fireman in and about said engine, being induced thus to continue the same by reason of the conduct, words, and actions of the defendant as aforesaid. He also charged that defendant and its employes were guilty of negligence toward him and others whose duties required them to work about said engine, in failing at once to restore the end of said house to its proper place; and that the accident to him complained of resulted from such negligence on their part, and without fault or negligence on the part of plaintiff. As stated in the brief of counsel for the appellee, the suit was brought upon the theory that the master had promised to repair the defect caused by leaving out the end of the house, and the injury having occurred within a reasonable time for the performance of such promise, and the defect not being of such a dangerous character that a prudent man would not have continued in the service, in view of the promise, for such reasonable time, the defendant company assumed the risk of the defect, thereby making itself liable to the plaintiff for the consequences of the accident. Without committing ourselves to the position thus broadly taken by counsel for the appellee, we think the facts alleged in the petition bring the case within the exception to the general rule, that the employe can not recover for injuries received from the use of defective implements or machinery of which he had notice, as recognized in Railway v. Drew, 59 Texas, 12. Plaintiff alleged that the accident would not have occurred but for the fact that the end of the house had not been replaced, and that defendant had promised to replace it within a very short time, and by its action induced plaintiff to believe that it would be replaced as promised; and that relying on the promises of defendant, and the custom and habit of defendant to replace the end, plaintiff continued to remain in its employ and the discharge of his duties. It also appeared from the petition that the engine had been returned to the car only about four days. It would appear from the petition that the defendant was negligent in failing to replace the end of the house that had been removed. The effect of the allegation with respect to the promise of the defendant to replace it within a short time would be to relieve plaintiff from negligence contributing to the injury by remaining in the service when the defect was obvious and the danger apparent, and he was entitled to have it go to the jury with other evidence for the purpose of determining whether or not, under the facts, he was guilty of contributory negligence. In Hough v. Railway, 100 United States, 224, the court said: “If under all the circumstances, and in view of the promises to remedy the defect, the fengineer was not wanting in due care in continuing to use the engine, then the company will not be excused for the omission to supply proper machinery upon the ground of contributory negligence.” So it would seem that proof of a promise to replace the end of the engine house would be admissible as evidence to show that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, and that, the question should be submitted to a jury. Railway v. Brentford, 79 Texas, 625; Railway v. Williams, 82 Texas, 342. • It can not be said that the jolt or jar was an intervening or independent cause contributing to the injury, and that the defendant would not be liable because it was the negligence of the fellow servant of the plaintiff, for it was against such contingencies that the end of the house would be-reasonably inferred to be a protection. Appellant’s eighth assignment of error is as follows: “That the court erred in overruling the defendant’s motion for new trial, the verdict of the jury being contrary to and against the charge of the court; the verdict of the jury being contrary to law. The verdict of the jury was found contrary to and against the evidence, the testimony showing that the danger was open, manifest, and well known to plaintiff, who was an intelligent man of much experience in that particular work. That it was only necessary to work at the fire on the piledriver car when it was at work, and the construction train was not moving. That the train was moving at the time of the accident, and it was gross negligence for the-plaintiff to be at work at the time on the piledriver car. That no promise was made to plaintiff of such character as would relieve him from the risk caused by removing and not replacing the end of the piledriver car.” We think that it conclusively appeared from the evidence that whatever defect or danger there was in the operation of the piledriver and the-engine with the end out, was equally as open and obvious to the plaintiff as it was to the defendant. The evidence showed that the piledriver and the engine by which it was operated were placed upon a flat car; the pile-driver being at one end and the engine at the other end of the car. Around the engine was erected a house large enough to enclose the engine, which had an upright boiler; three sides were fixed fast to the car, but the side or end of the house next to the end of the car was composed of four pieces of planks bolted in position, so that they might be unbolted and the end taken out for the purpose of removing the engine from the car when it became convenient to do so. When in position, the end of the house was so arranged that the middle planks slided to each side and formed a door or opening through which one might pass into the house and around the engine. Just next to this end of the piledriver car was a box car used as a tender for coal, tools, etc. It was the duty of plaintiff as fireman of the engine to shovel coal from the box car into the furnace of the engine. The house came within five inches of the end of the flat car on which it was situated, and in shovelling in coal plaintiff would stand sometimes with one foot on this part of the car and the other in the box car; but when the. end of the house was in position it was shown that he could stand in the door so as to brace himself and keep from falling, and that in case of a jolt or jar he would have something to catch hold of. When the end of the house was not in place there was no way to brace himself, nor was there anything to catch hold of, if he should be about to fall from the jolting of the cars. It was perfectly obvious that an attempt to shovel coal into the engine while the train was in motion, with the end of the house out, would be attended with danger. When the accident occurred the piledriver car had been taken into Houston for dinner, and the conductor of the train and the other employes were setting timber in position so as to go to work; the train was switching at the time. Plaintiff testified, that at the time he was shovelling the coal into the engine the train was not in motion, and that the jolt occurred just as he had finished and thrown the shovel into the box car; but all of the other eye-witnesses state that the train was in motion. Whether the train was in motion or not, there was no danger or defect about the condition of the engine house that the plaintiff was not fully aware of, and unless he is protected in remaining in the employ of the defendant by a promise, express or implied, to remedy the defect by replacing the end of the house, he can not recover. And it is doubtful if our Supreme Court would recognize the exception at all, unless the employe, having continued in this employment on the strength of the promise, should be ignorant at the time of the accident of the fact that the employer had failed to comply with his promises. But we do not think there was shown by the evidence any promise, either express or implied, or anything arising out of notice to the defendant’s foreman, such as would have induced the plaintiff to remain in the service. The want of authority in the foreman to make the promise does not .seem to be raised by the assignment of error, but it was sufficiently shown that he was in charge of the force operating the piledriver, with authority to hire and discharge, which must mean of course to hire and discharge the men under him. It was shown that sometime prior to June 3, the ends of the house had been taken out and the engine taken off the car for use elsewhere; that it was replaced on June 3, but the planks forming the ends of the house were not put in position again. Plaintiff did not work on that day, nor did he go to work until Wednesday noon, and the accident occurred on Friday, June 7. Plaintiff was questioned with reference to the promise, and answered as follows: Q. What did you say or do about the ends of the house ? . A. I told him Wednesday, “ How about this back part of the house ?” He said he would like to get through. This was about 6 o’clock Wednesday. He was just getting up on the box car, smoking a cigar. I called his attention to it, as it was there to protect me. He said he would like to get through. I told him again the next day, Thursday, at noon. He was standing in the car then, and I said, “Are you going to have this fixed up ?’ ’ and he said he would like to get through there. That was on Thursday, the 6th, right at noon. Q. Did he say he would put it up when he got through ? A. Yes, sir. (Defendant objected to question as leading.) Q. What did he state about putting it up P A. He said he would like to get through. The next day was Friday, -and I thought they would put it up on Sunday, so they would not lose two or three hours during working days. They put it up before on Sunday, the 17th of March. Told them about that house about three years ago. When they were taking it down I asked them about it, and they said they would put it back right away. In explaining how he got hurt, and after describing the injury, he said: “ They took me into the car and I said, ‘ You see what you have done ? Why didn’t they put up the back part of the house as I asked them to do ?’ While I was lying there bleeding I said to them, ‘ Why didn’t you put up the end as I asked you ? ’ ” Q. Who was that ? A. A foreman, Freeland. He said, “ Do you suppose we were going to accommodate you ? ” That was while I was lying on my bunk bleeding. Q. Did you run this risk, you say, as you thought they were going to put this up on Sunday ? A. They had always put it up on Sunday; they said they were going to fix it up. He further stated that they always put the end in on Sunday before. The only promise that can be at all inferred from this evidence is, that the foreman said that he would put the end in when he got through with the work that they were then at; and it nowhere appears that the plaintiff ever relied on this indefinite promise, for he says he thought they would put it up on Sunday, as they were in the habit of putting it up then; and it is clear that the plaintiff was not induced to remain in the service by any promise, either express or implied, to replace the end of the house. This was all the evidence as to a promise; the foreman denied having had any such conversation with plaintiff. It is unnecessary to notice the remaining assignments of error. They relate to the giving and refusing of charges. The charge of the court, taken as a whole, with the instructions given at the request of the defendant, was a fair presentation of the case. Because the verdict of the jury was contrary to the evidence in the respect pointed out, the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 26, 1893.","Southern Pacific Company v. John Leash. No. 83. 1. Known Risk—Contributory Negligence a Question for Jury. A fireman of a piledriver engine, while shovelling coal into the engine from a connected box car in which the coal was kept, was injured by being jolted off the flat car upon which was the piledriver engine, by the striking of a moving train against it. The piledriver engine was near one end of the fiat car, and was usually enclosed by a house with a sliding door at the end next to the coal car, in which the fireman might stand while shovelling coal, and protect himself from falling when jolted by grasping that end of the house. When the accident occurred that end of the house was entirely open. Plaintiff had been in the employ of the defendant company as pile engine fireman for a year or more. He alleged that defendant had promised to replace the end of the house within a very short time, as had always been the custom before when it had been removed, and that relying upon said promise and custom, he continued to remain in plaintiff’s employ, discharging his said duties, being induced to do so by said conduct, words, and action of defendant. The theory of the plaintiff was, that the master having so promised, and the injury having occurred within a reasonable time for the performance of the promise, and the defect not being of such a dangerous character as that a prudent man would not have continued in the service, in view of the promise, that defendant was liable. The effect of the allegation with respect to promise would be to relieve plaintiff from the negligence contributing to the injury. by remaining in the service when the danger was apparent, and the question of his negligence was one for the jury. 2. Negligence of B'ellow Servant.—It can not be said that the jolt was an intervening or independent cause contributing to the injury, and that the defendant would not be liable because it was the negligence of a fellow servant, for it was against such contingencies that the end of the house would reasonably be inferred to be a protection. 3. Promise to Repair.—Plaintiff knew of the defect, and the additional risk, and unless he is protected by a promise, express or implied, to remedy the defect by replacing the end of the house, he can not recover. Prior to June 3 the end of the house was taken out. The plaintiff went to work as fireman on June 5; the injury occurred Friday, the 7th. The evidence showed no promise to replace the end of the house on any named day; the inference from it being that the foreman would fix it as soon as he got through the work he was then at. The custom of the defendant’s employes was to replace the end of the house on Sunday. The plaintiff testified that he thought they would put it up on Sunday. It is therefore clear that he was not induced to remain in the service by any promise, either express or implied, to replace the end of the house, and therefore he can not recover. Appeal from Galveston. Tried below before Hon. Wm. H. Stewart. Waul & Walker, for appellant. 1.

The court did not err in overruling appellant’s motion for a new trial, because the evidence was sufficient to sustain the finding of the jury on the following material points, viz.: First. That the defective condition of the appliance had been called to the attention of the defendant previous to the accident, and that an authorized agent of defendant had promised the plaintiff to have the defect remedied, and that the accident occurred within a reasonable time after such promise was made. Second. That the defect complained of was the proximate cause of the accident, and that it was not of such an obviously dangerous character as to render plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence in continuing in the service a reasonable time longer after the promise was made; and that no negligence on the part of plaintiff contributed to the accident.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. Julia A. Vernoy sued Gf. W. Parsons, her son-in-law, joining his wife also as a defendant, together with M. M. Miller, Mrs. Lou F. White, J. K. P. Jordan, and C. W. Ayres, to cancel certain deeds and a bill of sale made by her to her son-in-law on the 2d day of September, 1882. From the verdict and judgment cancel-ling said deeds, Miller, Jordan, and Ayres have appealed. On the essential matter in dispute there was a conflict in the evidence, but the verdict -of the jury is supported in establishing the following conclusions: 1. That appellee, being in feeble'health, unable to read or write, and without the physical ability to manage and control her property, consisting of lands worth about $10,000 and livestock of the value of about '-$30,000; and reposing implicit confidence in her son-in-law, was deceived and defrauded in the execution of .said conveyances, by which the absolute title to all of said property was placed in him, except a tract of 320 acres, on which was her homestead, which was conveyed to him and his wife jointly. 2. That this fraud consisted in the preparation of the conveyances on his part, in violation of the confidence reposed in him, so as to convey the absolute title, when she did not intend to include the homestead at all, nor to make an absolute conveyance of the other property. 3. That the true nature of the conveyances executed by her was concealed by the son-in-law, who kept the deeds locked in his safe until just before the bringing of this suit. 4. That the appellants, who claim under conveyances from the son-in-law, parted with no new consideration at the time of receiving such conveyances, and that they were not innocent purchasers. Appellants submit four propositions under the following assignment of error: “ The court erred in overruling defendants’ exceptions to plaintiff’s petition, on the grounds in said exceptions stated.” This assignment is believed to be too general to require us to pass upon these propositions. Miller alone of the appellants filed an answer in the court below, in which are found several exceptions of a diverse character to the petition, raising questions of misjoinder, limitation, etc. Yoe & Harris v. Montgomery, 68 Texas, 340, and cases there cited. The petition is a long one, but has been examined sufficiently to satisfy us that it states a cause of action, and negatives the idea that by the use of proper diligence appellee could have discovered the alleged fraud in time to have brought this suit sooner. The relation of trust and confideuce by means of which the alleged fraud was accomplished is charged to have continued up to about the time of bringing the suit. The third assignment of error, under which appellants submit two propositions, is also believed to be too general to require consideration. It reads as follows: “The court erred in its several rulings adverse to defendants in the admission and exclusion of evidence, as shown by their bills of exceptions relating thereto, reserved on the trial, whereby the jury were misled and the defendants prejudiced.” Without determining whether there was error in admitting the testimony as set out in these propositions, we are of opinion that the verdict would probably have been the same had it been excluded. The fifth assignment, that ‘6 the court erred in refusing defendants’ requested charges correcting alleged errors in the charge in chief,” is also too general to be considered. The sufficiency of the fourth and only remaining assignment found in appellants’ brief is doubted, as it contains four subdivisions, all leveled at the charge of the court as a whole, upon different grounds, without pointing out any specific portion thereof as erroneous. The first proposition submitted under the fourth and fifth assignments complains of the charge of the court in relation to the statute of limitations; but as no such objection to the charge is found in either of these assignments, it can not be considered. The second proposition submits the objection contained, in the second subdivision of the fourth assignment, that the court “ignored the charge of fraud alleged in the petition, and instructed a, finding for plaintiff on the ground of mistake without proof thereof.” This specific objection to the charge as a whole is not sustained by the record. In the very beginning of the charge the court instructed the jury, that the burden was on plaintiff, Mrs. Yernoy, to establish her right to a recovery as prayed for, and that by this suit she sought to set aside the conveyances in question on the ground of fraud in their execution and delivery. Again, in the concluding part of the charge, the attention of the jury is called to the fact that appellee could not recover unless her deed to Parsons and wife had been fraudulently obtained, and this suit brought within a reasonable time after the discovery of the fraud. We think, then, it can hardly be said that the charge as a whole ignored the alleged fraud; nor can it be said that it instructed a finding for plaintiff below on the ground of mistake without proof of fraud, as the idea of mistake in the execution of the deeds was not even hinted at, either in the charge or in the evidence. The jury could not have reasonably so understood the charge. The evidence presented two theories, and two only; the one, that Mrs. Yernoy knowingly and intentionally executed the instruments sought to be cancelled as absolute conveyances, and that her claim to the contrary was an afterthought; the other, that the execution of the instruments in the form of absolute conveyances was the work of the son-in-law, who thereby designedly took advantage of the illiteracy and implicit confidence of Mrs. Vernoy to procure her signature to papers which did not express her intention. Upon this, the only real issue in the case, there was a sharp conflict in the evidence, Mrs. Vernoy testifying in support of the latter theory and Parsons in support of the former. If her testimony was true, that the deeds did not express what she intended them to express, and what she believed at the time they did express, the testimony of Parsons was manifestly false, and his fraud in procuring the deeds an irresistible inference. While we think the charge on this point was not as full as it probably should have been, still, as applied to the facts of this case, we are not prepared to hold that it was misleading to the- jury. We do not, therefore, in view of the specific objection taken to this charge as a whole, feel warranted in selecting portions thereof which might not be technically correct as grounds for reversing the judgment. « The other propositions submitted under these assignments challenge the correctness of the charge in reference to the defense of innocent purchaser, interposed by appellant Miller under his general denial of the allegations made by appellee on that issue. It appears from the record ""that Parsons had borrowed of Mrs. White $5000, and that appellants became his sureties on the note. Afterward, in order to protect himself, Miller procured from Parsons and wife a deed to the homestead property, by assuming to pay one-lialf of the debt due Mrs. White. As he parted with nothing of value at the time, and was not placed in any worse position than he had previously occupied, we are of opinion that he can not resist a recovery on this ground. It follows from these conclusions that the judgment must be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 30, 1893.","M. M. Miller et al. v. Julia A. Vernoy. No. 480. 1. Practice on Appeal—Assignment of Error.—Where there are several exceptions of a diverse character to the petition, an assignment of error that “ the court erred in overruling defendants’ exceptions to plaintiff's petition, on the grounds in said exceptions stated,” is too general to entitle the several propositions thereunder to be considered. 2. Same.—The following assignments of error are too general to require consideration, viz., that “the court erred in its several rulings adverse to defendants in the admission and exclusion of evidence, as shown by their bills of exceptions thereto reserved on the trial, whereby the jury were misled and the defendants prejudiced;” and that “the court erred in refusing defendants’ requested charges correcting alleged errors in the charge in chief.” 3. Same—Charge of Court.—Where an assignment of error makes a specific objection to the charge as a whole which is not tenable, the appellate court will not, under such assignment, select portions of the charge not technically correct as grounds for reversal. 4. Innocent Purchaser—Valuable Consideration.—Where a surety on a note assumes one-half of that debt as his own in consideration of a conveyance to him by the principal therein of certain property the apparent title to which is in the principal, this does not constitute the surety an innocent purchaser for value, as against another who is the equitable owner of the property. Appeal from Dallas. Tried below before Hon. E. E. Burke. Thomas & Turney and Bassett, Seay & Muse, for appellants. The court erroneously charged, that Miller could not be an innocent purchaser, because he paid nothing on the White note till after this suit was brought, though before notice he had become irrevocably bound to pay the purchase money.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. In 1885 appellees recovered judgment against R. W. Crawford and W. F. Duer, in the District Court of Waller County, from which Crawford and Duer prosecuted an appeal to the Supreme Court, giving a supersedeas appeal bond, to which the name of William Stapleton, the present plaintiff in error, appeared as one of the sureties. On March 1, 1887, the judgment of the District Court was affirmed, and the amount thereof adjudged against the sureties on the bond. Mandate was sent down to the District Court, and an execution was issued on the 10th day of May, 1887, against all the parties to the appeal bond, including Stapleton. The present suit was then instituted by Stapleton to enjoin the writ, and to set aside the judgment of the Supreme Court, upon the allegation that he had never signed the appeal bond, but that his name appearing thereto had been forged by some one unknown to him. A preliminary injunction was issued restraining the execution. Defendants filed exceptions to the petition, and a motion to dissolve the injunc-tian, on the ground that the District Court had no jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed for, and that if it could be obtained from any court, the Supreme Court was the only tribunal empowered to grant it. These exceptions were sustained, the injunction was dissolved, and the cause dismissed. The Supreme Court could obtain jurisdiction over the person of the plaintiff in error, as a surety on the appeal bond, by his voluntary act in signing it. If he did not in fact sign it, he never became a party to the proceeding, and no power to render judgment against him was ever obtained by that court. The reasons upon which are based the decisions which hold that a party to a judgment will not be allowed to attack it collaterally, by evidence aliunde the record that he had never been served with process, have no application here. The court, when its judgment is based upon service of process upon a party to the suit, is bound to inquire into its regularity and sufficiency, and when it has done so and pronounced its judgment, the record is held by our courts to impart absolute verity, and can not, in collateral proceedings, be contradicted by evidence to show that the party was not in fact served. The Supreme Court in passing on appeal bonds makes no inquiry into the genuineness of the signature to the same, but accepts them as they are found in the record. It does not undertake to ascertain whether the sureties actually executed the instrument, and has no means of doing so, unless issue is made before it. The judgment upon the bond follows as a matter of course upon affirmance of the judgment upon which the appeal is taken. One whose name has been forged to such a bond, without his knowledge, is no party to the appeal, and has no opportunity of being heard before that tribunal prior to the rendition of the judgment. To hold that it is conclusive against him would be a violation of fundamental principles, which bind no persons by judgments except parties and privies, and which entitle every one to a hearing before condemnation. The judgments of the Supreme Court have no greater efficacy than the final decrees of other courts of competent and general jurisdiction. A judgment pronounced by it without having obtained jurisdiction is as open to attack as that of any other tribunal. Against execution of a void judgment, equity will always, when necessary, afford relief by injunction. Witt v. Kaufman, 25 Texas Supp , 384; Johnston v. Loop, 2 Texas, 330. The original jurisdiction belonging properly to courts of equity is vested in the District Courts. The Supreme Court possesses no such powers. Its jurisdiction is appellate; and hence it is true that when the aid of equity is sought to afford relief to which a party is entitled against its judgment, the District Court and not the Supreme Court is the proper forum in which to institute the proceedings. It is true the Supreme Court has ample powers to “ ascertain such matters of fact as may be necessary to the proper exercise of its jurisdiction,” but the jurisdiction in aid of the exercise of which such evidence is receivable is its appellate jurisdiction. It doubtless had the power, as an incident to the proper disposition of the appeal in question, had the issue been made, to inquire into the execution of this bond. But the issue was not made by the parties, and plaintiff in error can not be held concluded by a judgment in a cause to which he was in no proper sense a party. The execution, if the facts alleged by plaintiff are true, conferred upon the sheriff no authority to levy upon plaintiff’s property, and was properly enjoined. The cause should have been heard upon the evidence, and if it was found that plaintiff had not executed the bond, nor authorized its execution, the sheriff and other defendants should have been perpetually enjoined from enforcing the judgment against plaintiff. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 16, 1893.","William Stapleton v. Fannie Wilcox et al. No. 115. 1. Injunction Against Void Judgment of Supreme Court—Jurisdiction.—S. sued to set aside a judgment of the Supreme Court, affirming a judment of the lower court against himself and another as sureties on the appeal bond, and to enjoin the execution issued thereunder, upon the ground that the appeal bond purporting to have been executed by him had never been signed by him, and that his signature to it was forged. He Id, that if the facts alleged are shown to be true, the execution might be perpetually enjoined, and that the District Court had jurisdiction of the suit to enjoin. 2. Supreme Court Jurisdiction. — The Supreme Court could obtain jurisdiction over the person of the plaintiff in error as surety on the appeal bond by his voluntary act in signing it; but if in fact he never signed it, he never became a party to the proceeding, and no power to render a judgment against him was ever obtained by the Supreme Court. 3. Same.—The reasons upon which are based the decisions which hold that a party to a judgment will not be allowed to attack it collaterally by evidence aliunde the record, that he never was served with process, have no application here. The Supreme Court in passing on appeal bonds makes no inquiry into the genuineness of its signatures, nor the actual execution of the instrument. To hold that a bond not in fact signed by the surety is conclusive against him, would be a violation of fundamental principles, which bind no persons by judgments except parties and privies, and entitle every one to a hearing before condemnation. 4. Jurisdiction of the Injunction Suit in the District Court. — The original jurisdiction properly belonging to courts of equity is vested in the District Court.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On August 31, 1888, appellees delivered to appellant at Gainesville, Texas, 349 head of beef steers, to be transported over its line of railway to St. Louis, Missouri, and thence to Chicago, Illinois, over connecting lines. The cattle, however, were received by appellees, and disposed of in St. Louis without going to Chicago. By reason of insufficient bedding in the cars, delays on the route, and bad facilities at stopping places for feeding and resting, the cattle were damaged 82.50 per head, four steers were killed and six crippled. Appellees brought this suit for the damage so sustained, alleging the damage by reason of the four steers killed at 885.20, to the six steers crippled at $60.30, and a depreciation in value of 339 head at 82.50 per head, or 8678; and also claimed $10 paid for extra bedding; and in their prayer ask judgment for the sum of $833.50. Upon the trial the killing of the four and the crippling of the six steers was proven, but no evidence was offered as to their value or the damage thereby caused. The depreciation in value of the 339 head was shown to have been as much as $2.50 per head, making $847.50. It will be noticed that there was a mistake made by appellees in their calculation i:i stating the damage to the 339 head at $678 instead of $847.50. A trial before a jury resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of appellees for $872.50, from which this appeal is prosecuted. The verdict, finding negligence on the part of appellant, and the damage to the 339 head to the extent above set forth, is supported by the evidence. There was evidence that appellees purchased some extra bedding, but it is not shown what this cost. Appellant pleaded a general denial, and specially, “ that the cattle in question were shipped under a written contract executed by plaintiffs and defendant, whereby, for a valuable consideration, plaintiffs agreed with defendant that as a condition precedent to their right to recover any damages for any loss or injury to their said stock during the transportation thereof, or previous to unloading thereof for shipment, they would give notice in writing of their claim therefor to some agent or officer of defendant, or to its nearest station agent, or to the agent at the delivering station of the railroad which carries said stock to its destination, or to the nearest station agent or general officer of such delivering road, before said stock was removed from the point of delivery, or from the place of destination, and before said stock was mingled with other stock, within one day after the delivery of said stock at its point of destination, and before the same should have been removed, slaughtered, or mingled with other stock, to the end that such claim might be fully and fairly investigated; and that a failure to comply with the terms of said clause of their contract should be a complete bar to any recovery for any and all such claims. And defendant says that plaintiffs wholly failed to comply with their said contract or to give the notice therein provided for; and defendant says that it had a station agent at St. Louis, Missouri, which was the terminus of its line of road, and that its general offices and general officers were at St. Louis, Missouri, all of which was known to plaintiffs, who knew and saw said station agent at the time; and that the destination of said cattle by contract was Chicago, Illinois, to which place, if they were not delivered by defendant to plaintiffs at St. Louis by their consent, after leaving defendant’s line of railway at St. Louis they were transported by and over the-railway, which railway had at Chicago, their point of destination, a station and station agent and general officers known to plaintiffs, and operated a line of railway into Chicago, which was the terminus of said delivering road.” The only question it is necessary for us to discuss in this case is the action of the court in sustaining the exception of appellees to the special answer of appellant, as set forth in the foregoing conclusions of fact. The exceptions so sustained by the court were: 1. Because the contract thus set up fails to show the name or place of residence of the general officer or station agent of defendant at St. Louis, Missouri, if any it had. 2. That said contract was illegal, unreasonable, against public policy, and voiu. In the case of Railway v. Harris, 67 Texas, 172, it is said: “It may well be doubted if such a contract as is relied on in this case ought ever to be sustained. If the carrier seeks to make its liability to depend on notice to its officer or agent of the claim for damages, it would seem that the responsibility of determining who is an officer or agent of the carrier within the meaning of the contract should not be cast upon the shipper, but that the person and his locality to whom the notices must be given ought to be made certain by the contract itself, and especially so when the carrier is a corporation, and the property is to be delivered beyond the line of its road over another carrier.” In Railway v. Fagan, 72 Texas, 132, it is said: “ If the shipper should make a contract to give such notice, it might be binding under our law if it was shown that there was such officer or agent at the point of destination, upon whom the notices could be conveniently served.” In Railway v. Adams, 78 Texas, 374, Associate Justice Henry, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: “ The bill of lading contained a stipulation to the effect that claims for loss or damage must be presented to the delivering line within thirty-six hours after the arrival of the freight. The testimony showed that plaintiff’s residence was within a few hundred yards of the depot at which the freight was received. That she received it on Saturday afternoon, and did not open the trunk or box in which the goods were packed until the following Monday morning, and that she was sick during the interval. The court, we think, fairly and correctly submitted to the jury the question whether the stipulation with regard to the time within which the claim was required to be made was a reasonable one. It was proper to submit that issue to the jury instead of its being decided as a question of law by the court, as appellant contends it should have been.” In Railway v. Greathouse, 82 Texas, 111, it is said: “ Without determining whether this provision in a contract such as this can in any case be enforced, we do not think the appellant has brought itself within the rules laid down in those cases that permit such contracts to be enforced and that recognize their validity. When such provisions of a carrier’s contract are enforced, it is upon the assumption that such agreement is a reasonable one, considered in the light of the subject matter of the contract and the circumstances and surroundings of the parties. To prove that such conditions in a contract are reasonable is a burden resting upon the carrier, who must show by proper pleadings and evidence the existence of facts that call for the enforcement of the conditions. There were no pleadings and proof whatever upon this question coming from the carrier.” ' We think it will be seen from the authorities above quoted, that in this State the validity of such a contract as the one pleaded by appellant depends upon the circumstances of each particular case, and that the circumstances to sustain such a contract must be set forth in the pleading and evidence of the carrier. Ordinarily we believe that a contract such as this, where the name and location of the agent to whom notice has to be given is not set forth in the contract, should be held unreasonable and invalid, but we are not prepared to say that this should be so in all cases. If the stock is to be delivered at a place where the carrier has a large number of agents and officers, we believe it would be unreasonable to require the shipper to take the responsibility of deciding which one of these is the authorized station agent, or which one of these is a general officer, within the meaning of a contract using these general terms. But if the delivery of the stock is to be made at a place where the carrier has only one agent, easily to be distinguished and easy of access, a contract which requires the notice in general terms to be given to the station agent at such place might not be unreasonable. We believe that the correct rule would be to hold that where the carrier pleads such a contract as this, in which the name of the agent or officer upon whom notice is to be served is not given, the pleading should be held bad, unless there be an additional allegation from which the jury might be authorized to find such contract to be reasonable as applied to the facts of that particular case; but when such allegations are made, it then becomes a question for the jury to decide as to whether or not the contract, under the evidence, is a reasonable one. In this case appellant alleges that it had a station agent in St. Louis, Missouri, where the stock were delivered, and that appellees knew and saw said station agent at the time; and under this -allegation we believe it became a question for the jury to decide under the evidence as to whether or not the contract was a reasonable one under the circumstances. If appellees knew and saw the station agent within the time called for in their contract, and were then aware of the damage they had sustained, we are not prepared to say that the jury would not be required to find that their failure to give notice as called for in their contract would preclude them from recovering. It will not be necessary for us to consider the other assignments of ■error, as upon another trial appellees will doubtless by amendment make the corrections in the figures and prayer complained of therein. In its second assignment of error appellant complains of the charge of the court, in that it makes it liable for the failure to transport the cattle in the usual - time, irrespective of whether such failure or delay was negligent or not. We do not think the charge, when applied to the facts in evidence, is subject to the objection made to it. Delivered November 15, 1892. For the error above indicated, let the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","The Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. J. W. Childers & Co. No. 13. Damages in Shipment of Live Stock — Stipulation for Notice of Claim Reasonable, when. — Plaintiffs shipped cattle over defendant’s railway, under a written contract, stipulating that as a condition precedent to his right to any damages he would, within one day after delivery of the cattle at the delivering station, and before their removal therefrom, etc., give written notice of his claim for damages to the station agent of the company at such point of delivery, or to one of its general officers, etc. Being sued for damages occasioned in the shipment of the stock, the railway company pleaded such contract and stipulation, alleging that it had a station agent at the point of delivery, and that plaintiffs knew and saw such agent at the time of delivery, and yet failed to give the notice stipulated for. Plaintiffs’ demurrer to this part of the answer, on the ground that such stipulation was unreasonable, contrary to public policy, and void, was sustained by the trial court. Held, the court erred in sustaining the demurrer. It should have been left to the jury to determine, under such pleadings and the evidence adduced, whether such stipulation as to notice was unreasonable or not. The validity of such stipulation depends on the circumstances of each particular case. Appeal from Cooke. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. R. C. Foster and A. E. Wilkinson, for appellant. The court erred in sustaining plaintiffs’ demurrer to the special answer of defendant, setting up a failure of plaintiffs to give notice of their claim for damages, as required in the contract for the shipment of Said cattle set forth in said answer. Plaintiffs shipped their cattle to St. Louis under a written contract, by which, for a valuable consideration, they agreed that they would give notice of any claim for damages to their cattle to the station agent of defendant at St. Louis, or to some one of its general officers, in time to enable defendant to investigate the merits of their claim before the sale and slaughter of the cattle should render such investigation impossible. Having failed to give such notice, they reply to defendant’s plea that the contract is unreasonable and void, because it did not give the name of the station agent or general officer of defendant at St. Louis on whom they were to serve such notice. The shipment was an interstate one, under which, as has been held, the contract was not one made invalid by our statute, but was to be determined as to its validity by the common law. Express Co. v. Darnell, 62 Texas, 639. It was also a shipment entirely over defendant’s road and ending at its terminus, where its general offices and officers were to be found, and where it had a station agent known to plaintiffs and seen by them at the time. All this appears from the pleading; and yet under these facts it is held that a contract requiring notice to such agent or general officer is unreasonable and invalid because it fails to give the name of the person so to be notified. This was error. Railway v. Cornwall, 70 Texas, 611; Railway v. Harris, 67 Texas, 166; Railway v. Underwood, 62 Texas, 21; Railway v. Trawick, 68 Texas, 319; Railway v. Moody, 35 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, 607; Railway v. Fagan, 72 Texas, 132; Express Co. v. Darnell, 62 Texas, 639. Mathis & Lewis, for appellees. The court correctly sustained the special exceptions to defendant’s answer of contract to give notice of claim for damages. The contract thus set up failed to show the names or place of residence of defendant’s general officers or station agent at St. Louis, Missouri, if any it had; and such contract was illegal, unreasonable, against public policy, and void.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice This suit was brought by B. L. Culver against the defendants, as receivers of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway in Texas, to recover damages for personal injuries received by the plaintiff while in the employ of defendants and in the discharge of his duties as brakeman, and alleged to have been caused by a defective hand-hold upon a car which the plaintiff was mounting, by reason of the rotten condition of the wooden roof to which the hand-hold was attached by screws. Trial was had by jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff upon a verdict in his favor for §5000. Briefly stated, the facts are, that on the 28th day of May, 1890, the plaintiff was in the employment of the defendants in the capacity of brakeman. He was an experienced railroad man of eight or nine years service, and was familiar with the duties of brakeman. On that day, while attempting to go on top of a box car in the train upon which he was braking, the hand-hold on top of the car pulled out and plaintiff was thrown to the ground and seriously injured. The cause of the hand-hold pulling out was because the top of the car to which it had been screwed was rotten. The condition of the hand-hold was not known to the plaintiff when he attempted to go on top of the car, and it was not open and patent to him, and under the circumstances he could not have known of it by the exercise of ordinary diligence. There was no rule of the defendants which required him to inspect the hand-hold or car before using the handhold. It was not customary to inspect the cars above the running gear at inspecting points, where the wheels and other running gear were inspected, but only when the cars were put on the repair tracks. Plaintiff was not a car inspector, but the brakemen were expected to report anything that they saw that was unsafe. Plaintiff testified that he had noticed a good many roofs being rotten at times, and had seen some of the cars belonging to the system of which the railway in charge of defendants was a part with rotten roofs, and had worked on cars with rotten roofs, but had never noticed any hand-holds loose. Plaintiff was hurt May 28, 1890, and the trial was had in February, 1891. Before the injury he had been a stout, healthy young man; but afterwards, up to the time of the trial, had been unable to do any work. He fell about sixteen feet, and in falling his right side struck on a flat car ■standing on a side track, and he then fell into a ditch alongside of the train, where he lay insensible, with blood running from his nose and mouth, until he was taken up and carried to the hospital. He had hemorrhages from the lungs on account of the injuries, shortly after-wards. He remained in the hospital about a month. He used crutches for awhile, but had discarded them. Dr. Baldwin examined him three or four months after the injury, and found him in a wretched state of health. He was considerably emaciated, had jaundice, and considerable trouble with his lungs. The doctor found his right lung in a congested state, and found scars located on the right side above the fifth or sixth rib, and right over the lung; the liver is just below this region. The lung was hepatized and consolidated, with very little air passing into it. It was caused by stasis, or stagnation of blood in the lungs. The other lung was clear and all right. It was the opinion of the physician that plaintiff’s condition was caused from a blow or injury; that-a blow was calculated to affect the lung by congestion. On further examination just before the trial, Dr. Baldwin found the condition of the lung still to be hepatized and consolidated in the lower part. Pleurisy, or inflammation of the pleura, was indicated. It was his opinion, that the lung was permanently injured, and on account thereof plaintiff was more liable to cold than if the lung was in its normal condition. It might take pneumonia. Plaintiff could not do the heavy work that he had done, and the lung would be always one great point in breaking down his health. Jaundice was merely a symptom of disease. There was much other evidence. The effect of all is, however, that the plaintiff was very severely injured, and received internal injuries which resulted in permanently impairing the lower lobe of his right lung, and weakening him so that he would never be capable of doing heavy work again. In view of the several assignments of error based on the charge of the court, it is set out in full, so far as pertinent. “1. The servant in entering the employment of a railway company assumes all the ordinary hazards incident to his employment, but they must be such as are patent—such as he actually knows or could have known by the exercise of ordinary care, or would reasonably be presumed to know. “ 2. The master is bound to use ordinary care to furnish suitable machinery and appliances for the safe discharge of the employe’s duty, and to keep them in proper repair, and if he fails to perform his duty in this respect, he is liable to the servant for any damages resulting from his neglect. “ 3. Negligence, in a general sense, is every omission to perform a duty imposed by law for the protection of one’s own person or property or that of another. Negligence, to some extent, should be measured by the character, risk, and exposure of the business under consideration, and the degree of care of all parties is higher when the lives and limbs of themselves or others are endangered than in ordinary cases. “4. Ordinary negligence is the want of such care and diligence as reasonably prudent men generally, in regard to the subject matter of injuries under such circumstances as those under consideration, would use to endeavor to prevent the injury complained of “ 5. Contributory negligence is negligence not only upon the part of the one committing the injury, but also upon the part of him upon whom the injury is committed, and by which they both contribute thereto. “6. One who is injured by the ordinary negligence of another can not recover damages therefor, if the injured party by his own ordinary negligence or willful wrong proximately contributed to the injury, so that it would not have happened but for his own fault. “ 7. The law required of plaintiff, as brakeman, for his own safe protection, the use of such ordinary care in the performance of the duty of his position as prudent men under similar circumstances would employ. “ 8. The master is called upon to use ordinary care, not only to furnish safe machinery for his servants, but he must also use this care to keep his cars and rolling stock in proper repair, and to employ competent men to inspect their cars, and the failure to perform this duty by their agent would be the failure of the master, that would make him liable if injury resulted to the servant. “ 9. And the master’s duty is not performed simply by the employment of competent men to repair and inspect its cars, but must go farther, and see that the cars are actually kept in repair, and a failure so to do would make the master liable if injury results from such failure. “ 10. If you believe from the testimony that plaintiff in the performance of his duty as brakeman, and without negligence on his part, started up the side of the car to set a brake, and when he got up and caught the top hand-rod, that said hand-rod pulled out by reason of the wood to which it was attached being rotten, and he fell to the ground and was injured, and that defendants were negligent as before explained in not keeping said hand-holds safely fastened to prevent injury, and plaintiff was injured thereby, defendants would be liable, and you will so find. “11. If plaintiff, however, knew that said hand-hold was not properly fastened, or by the exercise of proper care could have known it, or was. negligent in ascending the stepladder, he can not recover. Plaintiff, however, was not called upon to inspect the car before ascending it to fix the brake, to ascertain its condition. “ 12. If the wood to which the hand-hold was attached was rotten, but such defect was not patent, and defendants’ agents by the exercise of •ordinary care conld have discovered it, and failed to do so, and the plaintiff was injured, defendants would be liable. The defendants, however, would not be liable if they used ordinary care in inspecting the car and in keeping it in repair, nor would they be liable if the defect was hidden, and could not have been discovered by the exercise of ordinary care.” The several questions presented by the appellant have been heretofore disposed of by this court in Fordyce v. Withers, 1 Texas Civ. App., 540. An inspection of the entire charge will show that there was no error in the paragraph complained of under the third assignment of error, as follows: “And the master’s duty is not performed simply by the employment of competent men to repair and inspect its cars, but must go further, and see that the cars are actually kept in repair, and the failure so to do would make the master liable if any injury results from such failure.” It was unquestionably the duty of the defendants to exercise reasonable care in seeing that the cars were kept in repair, and the charge, taken as a whole, imposes no greater duty upon them. There is nothing in the evidence to support the contention of the appellants, that it was the duty of the brakeman to inspect the cars. There was no rule of the defendants to that effect; nor did it appear that the brakemen were also inspectors, or that inspection was expected of them. It was only expected that they would report anything that they saw that was unsafe. The special instruction number 4 requested by the defendants, so far as applicable to the evidence, was included in the charge of the court in chief. It was to the effect, that if the jury believed from the evidence that the plaintiff had the same or equal means of knowing the condition of the hand-hold on the top of the car as did the defendants, and its defect therein was patent, open, and visible, then they should find for the defendants. The seventh assignment of error is as follows: “The court erred in its refusal to give special instruction number 6, requested by the defendants, wherein the jury were asked to be instructed substantially as follows: ‘ That if they should find from the evidence that the top of the box car was rotten, and should further find that the plaintiff did not know that the top was rotten, yet if the evidence showed that at and prior to the time he received the injury he knew there were a number of cars on the road with rotten tops, and that in attempting to climb upon the same, in the way in which he was climbing when he was hurt, was liable to receive an injury by reason of the pulling out of the handhold on top of the car, then he assumed all risk incident to this condition of affairs, and if he was thereby injured he could not recover.’ ” The instruction was not applicable. While plaintiff was aware of the rotten condition of the tops of some of the cars, it doés not follow that he knew that they were rotten where the hand-holds were attached. He said he had never noticed hand-holds loose; and the evidence does not show that the cars were so uniformly rotten as to establish a condition of which plaintiff was bound to take notice. In the case of Railway v. Sommers, 71 Texas, 700, where it was shown that the plaintiff knew that many of the cattle guards were so constructed as to be dangerous to employes operating the train, it was 'held that such knowledge would put the employes upon notice of their construction generally. The cattle guards, however, were permanent in the nature of their structure, and it was held that a knowledge that many of them were constructed tad near the track would lead to a knowledge that all were constructed in the same manner. There was no error in refusing the charge asked. Upon a careful consideration of all the evidence, we can not say that the verdict of the jury is so clearly excessive that we ought to set it aside. We find no error for which the judgment ought to be reversed, and it will therefore be affirmed. Affirmed Delivered March 30, 1893.","Fordyce and Swanson, Receivers, v. B. L. Culver. No. 23. 1. Injury to Brakeman — Case in Judgment.—Plaintiff, a bralceman of eight or ten years service, attempted tó go to the top of a box car upon which he was braking; the hand-hold on top of the car pulled out, and he was thrown to the ground and seriously injured. The cause of the hand-hold pulling out was because the top of the car to which it had been screwed was rotten. The condition of the hold was not known to the plaintiff, was not patent, and could not have been known by the exercise of ordinary diligence, and no rule of the company required him to inspect the hand-hold before using it. He had noticed a good many roofs rotten on the road, and had worked on cars with rotten roofs, but never noticed any hand-holds loose. A verdict for §3000 was affirmed. 2. Case Approved. — Fordyce v.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. April 20,1890, G. N. Rice instituted this suit of trespass to try title, to recover from appellees herein as defendants a survey of 640 acres of land, lying in Cooke County, and patented to the heirs of Estevan Mora. The plaintiff Rice claimed the land by virtue of certain conveyances executed by persons claiming to be heirs of Estevan Mora. Pending the suit, the appellants herein, Belle Hunt Shortridge and others, who are heirs of W. H. Hunt, intervened. Their claim is founded upon the transfer to W. II. Hunt, their ancestor, of the certificate by virtue of which the land was located. This transfer was executed by Jose Mora, Mauricio Mora, and Eulogio Mora, representing themselves to be the sole heirs of Estevan Mora. Before the trial in the court below, the defendants S. B. Allen and others purchased the interest of the plaintiff Rice, and thereby became admittedly the owners of more than one-tliird of the land in controversy. The suit was thus limited to an issue for the remainder of the land between the intervenors, as heirs of W. II. Hunt, and the defendants, as heirs of C. C. Alexander. This issue resulted in a judgment for the defendants, from which the intervenors prosecute this appeal. January 13, 1855, a certificate for the land in controversy was issued to the heirs of Estevan Mora, on which certificate the land was patented September 12, 1859. November 10, 1854, three of the children of Estevan Mora, deceased, representing themselves to be his only heirs at law, sold the certificate, by warranty deed, to W. H. Hunt, the ancestor of intervenors. The grantors in this deed were not the sole heirs of Estevan Mora. The interest of the remaining heirs, amounting to more than one-third of the land in controversy, is the property of the defendants. April 27, 1854, W. H. Hunt and A. M. and C. C. Alexander entered into the following contract: “Memorandum of a contract entered into this the 27tli day of April, 1854, between A. M. and C. C. Alexander and William H. Hunt, both parties residents of the State of Texas and County of Fannin. The said A. M. and C. C. Alexander being the owners of the certificates described in the schedule hereunto attached, and being desirous to have them located, employ the said W. H. Hunt to locate them upon the following terms, viz.: “ The said Hunt is to select the lands, cause them to be surveyed, return the field notes to the General Land Office, pay all government dues, procure the patents and deliver them to said Alexander at Bonham, entirely at his own expense. In consideration of which services the said A. M. and C. C. Alexander are to convey to the said Hunt one-third of the land so located, making him the owner of an undivided third of said lands. All certificates which may be added to the attached schedule hereafter shall be located by said Hunt under the terms of this contract. “In testimony of which we sign our names and set our scrolls. [Signed] “A. M. Alexander, “C. C. Alexander, “Wm. H. Hunt.” To this contract is attached a schedule of land certificates referred to in the m emorandum. In this list is the following entry: ‘ ‘ Estovan Mora, 2 claims, 640, 320; ■ P. 960;” the last named in the list being “ Elizabeth Jones, 3902.” The caption to this schedule is as follows: “ List of W. H. Hunt & Co. land certificates, located and unlocated, of which W. H. Hunt has an undivided one-third.” This memorandum is in the handwriting of Wm. II. 1-Iunt. The list of certificates, or the schedule attached thereto, is in the handwriting of one Fraily, who was the clerk of C. C. Alexander, except the last name appearing in the list, “Elizabeth Jones, 3902.” This is in the handwriting of W. H. Hunt. This memorandum or agreement, together with the transfer to W. II. Hunt, was among the papers of C. C. Alexander at his death, and has been in the possession of his executor ever since the qualification of the latter, in 1866. The heirs of C. C. Alexander own whatever interest A. M. Alexander had in the land in controversy. W. H. Hunt died in 1864, C. C. Alexander in 1865, and A. M. Alexander in 1866. S. B. Allen, the executor of C. C. Alexander, has paid the taxes on these lands since 1866, though it does not seem to have been rendered in the name of the estate in Cooke County. The taxes were paid in Fannin County, where Allen lived-, and were remitted by the tax collector of Fannin to the collector of Cooke County, except for the year 1879, when the land was sold for taxes because of the failure of the collector to remit. From this tax sale the executor subsequently redeemed the property. Four years prior to .the suit the appellees, through their tenant, took possession of the land, fencing about 400 acres. The appellees, though well acquainted with them, did not inform the children of W. I-I. Hunt of the documents in their possession referring to this land. The children of Hunt, knowing that their father had previous'to his death dealt largely in land, had exerted diligent inquiry with reference to his claims. They had no intimation of Hunt’s connection with the land in controversy until after the institution of this suit. The three assignments of error first urged by appellants complain alike, though in different terms, of the court’s finding, that Hunt, the ancestor of intervenors, sold the Mora land certificate co Alexander. This conclusion was evidently founded upon the recital contained in the memorandum heretofore set out, and entered therein by Hunt himself, showing that A. M. and C. C. Alexander are the. ‘1 owners of the certificates described in the schedule hereunto attached. ’ ’ This recital must be deemed binding upon Hunt and upon his privies in blood, in estate, or in law, and to estop him and them from asserting the existence of a state of facts different from that which the recital imports. Kimbro v. Hamilton, 28 Texas, 568. The fact that the Estevan Mora certificate was issued after the execution of this memorandum or agreement does not affect the correctness of this conclusion, since by its language the agreement affects with its terms and conditions “ all surveys which may be added to the attached schedule.” . The court also correctly held that the description of the Mora claim as given in thé schedule was sufficient to indicate that this certificate was in-O eluded in the transfer implied by the contract. The description reasonably identified the certificate or claim as the property intended to be transferred. Appellants next insist that the court erred in finding ‘1 that the evidence is not sufficient to show that Hunt complied with his part of the contract for locating and procuring a patent for the land in controversy.” The evidence in the record, notably the recital in the caption preceding the list of claims or certificates attached to the memorandum, that • ‘W. H. Hunt has an undivided one-third” interest in the certificates constituting the list, in connection with the fact that the Mora claim had been , patented, indicates that there is probable error in the conclusion complained of. Such error, if it exist, will not require a reversal of the judgment. This action, while in form a suit of trespass to try title, must be viewed as in reality an action for specific performance, in so far as recovery is sought for the one-third locative interest stipulated for in the written agreement between the Alexanders and Hunt. The defendants pleaded against the recovery thus sought the statute of ten years limitation, and the defense of stale demand. If Hunt performed the locative services claimed by appellants, his cause of action matured with the procuring of the patent obtained in compliance with his locative contract. This patent having issued September 29, 1859, his cause of action then accrued, and the defense of stale demand began its course. Having thus commenced to run during the lifetime of W. H. Hunt, it is unaffected by the coverture or other disabilities of the intervenors; nor is its application changed by the fact, that by analogy to the statute of limitation it was suspended during the period intervening between the 28th day of January, 1861, and the 3d day of December, 1869. Cattle Co. v. Ward, 1 Texas Civ. App., 307. Appellants seek to avoid the effect of stale demand by the plea that the appellees fraudulently concealed from them their interest in the land in controversy. For the reason that the right to specific performance and the cause of action thereon accrued during the lifetime of W. II. Hunt, and that he, at least, was necessarily apprised of the condition of the property, and that as above indicated the defense of stale demand was incipiently operative against him, it must be deemed to have continued against his heirs, and consequently this plea of fraudulent concealment can not be invoked. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the plea of ten years limitations set up by appellees, or other questions discussed in the briefs of the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 31, 1893.","Belle Hunt Shortridge et al. v. S. B. Allen et al. No. 84. 1. Land. Certificate —Title by Estoppel.—H. purchased from certain heirs a land certificate which had issued to M., and a contract made by H. with A. for the location of certain certificates described in a schedule thereto attached, which schedule included the M, certificate, recited that the certificates so described were the property of A., and that H. was to locate them and receive therefor one-tliird of the land when he procured issuance of the patents. Held, that the recital that A. owned the certificates was binding on the heirs of £L, who were estopped thereby from claiming the contrary. 2. Land Certificate—Sufficient Description.—The certificate was described in the schedule to the locative contract as follows: “ Estevan Mora, two claims, 640, 320, P. 960,” and the description reasonably identified it as the property intended to be transferred. 3. Stale Demand—Locative Interest.—Patent on the certificate issued {to the heirs of M.) in 1859, during the lifetime of H., and the suit in which the claim of the heirs of H. was asserted was filed in 1890. Held, that the claim, as to the locative one-third, was in the nature of an action for specific performance, and was barred by stale demand, which having begun to run against H. in bis lifetime, continued to run unaffected by coverture or other disability on the part of his heirs. 4. Stale Demand—Fraudulent Concealment.—An answer to the plea of stale demand, alleging that A. and his representatives had fraudulently concealed from the heirs of H. their locative interest in the land, is not good, since stale demand having begun to run against H. himself, who was necessarily apprised of the condition of the property, must be deemed to have continued to run against his heirs, notwithstanding such fraudulent concealment. Appeal from Cooke, Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. S. B. Garrett and C. B. Stuart, for appellants. 1. The court erred in finding that Hunt, ancestor of intervenors, sold the Mora land certificate to the Alexanders, because the only evidence-of sale was the memorandum offered in evidence, in which Hunt agrees to locate certain land certificates for a portion of the land, and because such memorandum is wholly insufficient to show title to such certificate in the Alexanders.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. Appellant prosecutes this appeal from a judgment awarding to appellee the sum of $500 as damages on account of the failure of the appellant to deliver the telegram herein below set out. Appellee lived near Dexter, in Cooke County, Texas. His minor son, Ed. Carter, had been working at Marietta, in the Indian Territory, about fourteen miles west of Dexter, when he was taken sick, and after an illness of twenty-eight days, died on October 29, 1889, about 3:30 o’clock p.m. About 4 p. m. of that day the appellee, in company with Dr. Applewhite, who, as a physician, had treated the son during his last illness, went to appellant’s office, and Dr. Applewhite, for the appellee and at his request, caused to be prepared and sent the following message, for which appellee, through Dr. Applewhite, paid 25 cents: “Marietta, I. T., October 29, 1889. ‘■‘■Frank Morris, Gainesville, Texas: “Ed. is dead. Send coffin six feet four inches long on morning express. [Signed] “ B. L. Applewhite.” The object of this telegram was to procure a coffin in which to bury the corpse of the deceased son. It was appellee’s desire to convey the body for interment near his home in Texas. He wished to leave wi*b the body early on the morning of October 30, so as to reach the graveyard in time for interment on the evening of that day. The message was received at appellant’s office at Gainesville at 4:40 p. m. of October 30. Mr. Morris, the addressee, was the tax collector of Cooke County, his office being about 300 yards from appellant’s office, and his residence being in the same town and conveniently accessible. By reasonable diligence the message could have been delivered to Mr. Morris by 5 p. m. on the day on which it was received. It was not delivered until after 9 o’clock a. m. of the next day. The appellant was thus guilty of negligence. As a consequence, the coffin was not procured and sent (as it would have been) by the express train of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway which left Gainesville so as to reach Marietta at 7 o’clock a. m. As a further consequence, Mr. Morris did not send the coffin so as to reach the appellee before 6 p. m. of October 30, too late to make the journey to the cemetery. The interment was thus delayed until 2 or 3 o’clock p. m. of October 31—a delay of twenty-four hours. In the meanwhile the body began to decompose and became very offensive, thus causing appellee great distress of mind. When the coffin failed to arrive in accordance with the telegram, appellee diligently sought to procure one at Marietta, but failed. Appellee testified, that at the time the message was sent and paid for he told the agent of appellant that he wanted the coffin for the corpse of his son. There was evidence of a negative character tending to contradict this statement. The trial court, as indicated by its ruling upon the defendant’s general demurrer, and by the charges which it gave and the requested instructions which it refused, was of opinion that the grief and mental anguish sustained by the plaintiff was an element of damage proper to be considered by the jury in passing upon the defendant’s failure to comply with its. contract to deliver the telegram. Appellant’s first, second, fifth, seventh, and eighth assignments of error complain of this view. The doctrine, that damage of this character may be considered the natural and direct consequences of a failure to transmit a telegraphic message such as the one in question, has become so firmly fixed in our jurisprudence that the action of the appellant seems scarcely to be justified in requiring us to reannounce it. Stuart v. Tel. Co., 66 Texas,, 581; Tel. Co. v. Broesche, 72 Texas, 654; Hale v. Bonner, 82 Texas, 33., Appellant’s petition contains certain averments (which we do not find: necessary to specifically set out) having reference to a conversation between the addressee, Morris, and appellant’s agent at Gainesville, after the delivery of the telegram. Appellant, in its third assignment of error, complains of the action of the court in overruling a special exception addressed by it to these averments. As appellee introduced no evidence whatever in support of these allegations, it is impossible, in our opinion, that the action complained of could have been detrimental to the defendant. Tel. Co. v. Evans, decided by this court November 1, 1892 [1 Texas Civ. Apps., 297]. The testimony showed that appellee was the principal of Dr. Apple-white, who sent the message, and that he had a beneficial interest in it. The court therefore did not err in refusing appellant’s special instruction, to the effect that appellee had no beneficial interest in the telegram. Appellant’s third special instruction, of the refusal of which it complains in its sixth assignment of error, was given quite literally in that portion of the court’s charge in which the jury were instructed, that unless they should find from the evidence “ that defendant’s agent at Marietta knew at the time he accepted said message for transmission that it was sent for the benefit of plaintiff, the jury would find for the defendant.” Indeed, this instruction might well have been complained of by the plaintiff, for it has been held in Telegraph Company v. Broesche, 72 Texas, 657, that such knowledge on the part of the agent is not necessary to the plaintiff’s cause of action. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 9, 1893.","The Western Union Telegraph Company v. O. W. Carter. No. 110. 1. Telegraph Company — Damages for Mental Anguish.—Where plaintiff sent by telegram an order for a coffin for the body of his minor son, and owing to negligence of the telegraph company in delivering the message the interment was delayed for twenty-four hours, during which the body began to decompose and became very offensive, plaintiff’s grief and mental anguish in consequence was a direct and natural result of the company’s negligence, and a proper element of damages. 2. Same —Message Sent by one Person for Another. — The court did not err in refusing to charge that plaintiff had no beneficial interest in the telegram, where the evidence showed that it was sent at his request and for his benefit by one A., although plaintiff’s name was not signed thereto, and did not appear therein. 3. Same — Notice to Telegraph Company of Sender’s Agency not Necessary—Case Followed.—Where a telegram is signed and sent by one person, but at the request and for the benefit of another, it is not material to the rights of such other person that his interest or the sender’s agency in the matter should be known to the telegraph company or its agent receiving the message for transmission.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Tripis brought this suit to recover for a balance alleged to be due by the defendants to him as commissions for the sale effected by him of land which was the separate property of the wife. Defendants demurred to the petition, because it did not show,that there was any such contract to pay commissions as would bind Mrs. Smith. They also defended, and denied their liability, because in effecting the sale plaintiff had fraudulently acted also as the agent of J. B. Rosborough and J. M. Rosborough, the purchasers of the land, and was himself interested in the purchase. Mrs. Smith pleaded in reconvention for the sum of $1000 already paid to plaintiff by her husband out of the proceeds of said land, which was her separate estate. She alleged fully the want of authority on the part of her husband to make the contract with plaintiff to pay him such commissions; and averred that if any trade or contract was ever made between the plaintiff and her said husband, it was without her knowledge or consent, and was made in fraud of her rights. She denied that she had ever consummated the trade as alleged by plaintiff, or that she had ever recognized the plaintiff as her agent in the sale of the land, or that she had ever paid or agreed to pay plaintiff any sum of money for his pretended services. She alleged, that said sum of $1000 was paid out of her separate funds by her husband, without her knowledge or consent, and in utter disregard of and in fraud of her rights; and that the payment was made through the false and fraudulent representations of the plaintiff, and through the ignorance and mistake of her said husband, and that the money was wrongfully and illcgalty received by the plaintiff; wherefore she prayed judgment for the recovery of the money, with interest. As shown by a bill of exceptions, the plaintiff made a verbal motion Ur strike out the plea in reconvention, which was sustained, and an exception was taken. On presentation of the demurrer to the petition, that it did not show a cause of action against Mrs. Smith, the demurrer was sustained, and Mrs. Smith was dismissed from the suit and judgment was rendered in her favor on the cause of action set up by the plaintiff. On trial by the court, the plaintiff recovered judgment against the defendant S. H. Smith for the amount sued for. Both defendants have appealed. The court should not have entertained an oral demurrer to Mrs. Smith’s plea in reconvention. The plea also showed a good cause of action in Mrs. Smith for the recovery of the $1000 already paid by the defendant S. II. Smith to the plaintiff, and the court erred in dismissing the same. The petition itself failed to allege sufficient facts to show the liability of Mrs. Smith for the commissions claimed by the plaintiff. Her plea in reconvention alleged that she was not liable; that she never ratified the sale, nor in any manner bound herself to pay the money that was paid; and that the same was paid in fraud of her rights and without her consent or knowledge. The facts set out in the plea are fully sufficient, if true, to authorize a recovery by Mrs. Smith from Tripis of the money already paid to him. It appeared from the evidence, that sometime in December, 1890, Smith requested Tripis to sell the land, and fixed the minimum price at $4 per acre. The land was an undivided one-fourth interest in 36,000 acres in Aransas County, and belonged to Mrs. Smith in her separate right. Smith agreed with Tripis to pay him a commission of 5 per cent. Sometime after this, Tripis was in San Antonio, where he met J. M. Rosborough, who inquired of him if he knew of any good investments in lands down in his country, stating that his uncle, J. B. Rosborough, of Salt Lake, had some surplus money that he wanted to invest. Tripis told him of the land, and that it could be had at $4 an acre; and after he returned to Rockport he entered into a correspondence with J. M. Rosborough on the subject. 1-Ie told Smith he thought he had found a purchaser. The Rosboroughs went to Rockport and wanted to see Smith, but Tripis kept them apart, representing that it would result in breaking up the trade if they met, and that if anything could be effected in reducing the price of the land he could do it better than any one else, and pretended to go and see Smith The Rosboroughs supposed that he was their agent in effecting the trade for the land, and although they paid him no commission for making the purchase, they agreed to let him into the purchase as an equal partner, and J. B. Rosborough advanced him the money to pay his proportion of the first payment of $5000. Smith and wife signed a contract by which they agreed to convey the land to the Rosboroughs and Tripis, the latter representing to Smith that the Rosboroughs would not take the land unless Tripis was admitted as an equal partner in the purchase. J. B. Rosborough gave a draft for the $5000 cash payment, and when the draft was collected two or three weeks afterwards, Smith paid Tripis out of the proceeds $1000, and Tripis asked him to say nothing to the Rosboroughs about having paid him a commission. In making the sale and purchase Tripis was acting for himself and in his own interest. Without further statement of the facts, we think that the admitted facts in the case show that Tripis placed himself in hostility to the interests of his principal. The price $4 was given by Smith to Tripis as a minimum price, and it was the duty of Tripis to get as much for the land as possible. When he became interested in the purchase he put himself in hostility to the interests of his principal. J. D. Rosborough testified, that Tripis was interested with them from the start; that they wanted him to take a less interest, but he insisted that-the land was cheap, and he wanted to buy, and would be valuable to them in colonizing the land. The facts show that Tripis was not entitled to recover, because he became interested adversely to his principal Smith. Although Smith knew that Tripis was interested as a purchaser with the Rosboroughs when he and his wife signed the contract of sale, he was not in possession of all the facts showing the adverse interest of Tripis. The finding of the court that Tripis acted in good faith with Smith is not sustained by the evidence. The objection to evidence on account of variance may be avoided on another trial. The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded for another trial. Reversed and remanded. ■ Delivered February 2, 1893.","H. S. Smith and Wife v. Joseph Tripis. No. 211. 1. Land Agent’s Commissions when Himself a Purchaser.—Appellee sued for commissions for sale of land for appellants, who answered that plaintiff was himself interested in the purchase. The facts showed that the land was sold at the minimum price, that the plaintiff was let into the purchase as an equal partner at his own request, and that the other purchasers advanced him the money to pay his proportion of the first payment; that he represented to Smith that the purchasers would not take the land unless he was admitted as an equal partner in the purchase: held, that when he became interested in the purchase, he put himself in hostility to the interests of his principal, and the finding of the court below, that be acted in good faith, is not sustained by the evidence. 2. Verbal Motion to Strike out Plea in Intervention.—The court should not have entertained an oral demurrer to Mrs. Smith’s plea in reconvention. 3. Sale of Land of Wife by Agent under Contract with Husband.—The wife by plea in reconvention sought recovery of $1000 paid by her husband out of the purchase money of her land, to the appellee, in part payment of commissions claimed by him for making sale of it. She alleged want of authority on the part of her husband to make contract with Tripis, and nonliability on her part; that the land was her separate estate; want of knowledge of the contract, or the payment of the money by her husband; no recognition of Tripis as her agent, nor ratification of sale, and that the payment was made through the false and fraudulent representations of plaintiff and the ignorance and mistake of her husband. The plea showed a good cause of action in Mrs. Smith for the recovery of the $1000 paid by the husband to plaintiff. Appeal from Aransas. Tried below before Hon. E. A. Stevens, County Judge. McFarland, Elgin & McFarland, for appellants. It is the policy of the law to prevent multiplicity of suits. The land being by admission of the plaintiff the separate property of the defendant Clara Smith, the money arising from the sale of it was her separate property, and could not, in the absence of a contract with her, be legally paid over to the plaintiff Tripis. Said $1000 having been so illegally paid over to the plaintiff, with his knowledge of its ownership, the defendant Clara Smith’s right of recovery against the plaintiff Tripis must be unquestioned.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Action for damages, brought March 31, 1891, in the District Court of Fayette County, by appellee, against appellants as receivers of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, for injury to a museum delivered to the defendants for shipment to Dallas, Texas, for exhibition at the State Fair in October, 1890; and also for loss of profits in the exhibition of the museum by reason of the failure of defendants to transport and deliver the same. Trial was had by a jury on June 6, 1891, and verdict and judgment were m favor of the plaintiff. Appellants assign as error the refusal of the court to give in his charge to the jury the following instruction requested by them: “You are hereby charged that under the facts in this case the plaintiff can not recover for mental anguish, and in assessing your damage,"" if you find from the evidence that he is entitled to any, you will not take this into consideration.” In his petition appellee stated the damages resulting from the failure of the defendants to transport the museum expeditiously, and to have the same at Dallas at the opening of the fair, to be, that he""“ lost all opportunity to make money at said point by exhibiting his said collection of birds, animals, etc., and lost his own time, besides the expense of keeping and paying his employes in the city of Dallas, and his trouble, vexation, and worry.” There was no special exception addressed to the element of damage last stated, and the plaintiff testified, without objection, that he experienced great mental anxiety on account of the delay of the museum. It is stated in the brief of appellants that counsel for plaintiff read cases to the court, in the hearing of the jury, wherein it was held that mental anguish was a proper element of damages, but this has not been brought to our attention in such a manner that we can take notice of it. However, we think, under the circumstances, that the court should have given the instruction requested, as the jury may have been influenced in their verdict by the allegation and testimony as to the mental anguish. The evidence does not show that the museum was ever out of the possession of the defendants, and it was last in their possession and was received from them at Muldoon; hence it was not error for the court to refuse the requested instruction requiring the plaintiff to show upon what line of railway the damage was done to the property, nor to give the instruction that under the undisputed evidence the plaintiff was entitled to recover. Appellee was permitted to testify on the trial, over the objection of the appellants, as shown by their bill of exception, that it took him ten years to collect the various specimens in his museum, and that liis services were worth $1000 a year. The objection to this evidence, that the value of the museum, or the damage thereto, could not be measured by the time devoted to the preparation or acquisition of the specimens composing it by the plaintiff, was well taken; for the measure of damage for the injury to the specimens would be the market value of such as might have been destroyed, and the difference in value of such specimens as may have been partially injured, just before the injury and just after. If the articles destroyed or injured had no market value at Muldoon, then the market value of such articles at the nearest place where they had a market value should be shown. If it should be shown by the evidence that the specimens had no market value, then it would be proper to show what they could be replaced or repaired for. It is very probable that the specimens composing the plaintiff’s museum had no market value in Muldoon, Payette County, but we have no doubt but that there are places where such specimens could be bought, and that there are persons who could furnish them at an expense which could be approximately estimated. It certainly would not be admissible to show how much time and labor it cost plaintiff to gather them, when from various causes he may have expended more upon them than it would take to replace them, or than they would be worth in the market where they could be had. The charge of the court, that the articles had no general market value, was clearly error as upon the weight of the evidence. While there was some testimony that they had no market value, still the evidence as to the nature of the articles, and the manner of their collection and preparation, tended to show that they were all such specimens as might have a market value. The third division of the charge, to the effect that the depreciation in value of the articles not injured, caused by injury to other articles, submitted an element of damages too speculative and uncertain; because such injury or depreciation could only result from a general lessening of interest in the museum by reason of the loss of certain specimens, there being no evidence to show any other dependence of the articles on each other for value than such as would go to make up a whole collection. As before stated, the proper measure of damages would be the injury to each article. When plaintiff delivered his museum to the defendants for shipment to Dallas, he notified their agent of the purpose for which it was being shipped, and such notice was given as would render the defendants liable for such special damage as he might probably sustain by reason of the failure to have the museum there for exhibition, in the way of lost profits therefrom. Such special damage was alleged in the petition, and the plaintiff testified in support thereof; and upon this issue the court charged the jury as follows: “ In estimating the damage resulting from the failure of the defendants to ship the museum to the town of Dallas, you will consider the reasonable expenses the evidence may show the plaintiff has incurred for himself and his employes in going to and returning from Dallas, and during the time he remained in Dallas awaiting the arrival of the museum shipped. The plaintiff is also entitled to recover whatever net profits the evidence shows he may have earned by the exhibition of the said museum, if it had been transported without delay and with due expedition, according to agreement.” Appellants contend that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the probable net profits of an exhibition of the museum at the Dallas fair, because they would be too speculative and uncertain. Perhaps he would not be entitled to recover them as net profits, but he would be entitled to recover for the value of the use of the property at such place and time, and such value could not be more properly determined than by ascertaining what the probable net profits of the exhibition would have been. In the charge complained of, the court having directed the jury that plaintiff was entitled to recover the reasonable expenses incurred for himself and employes, as well as the net profits of the exhibition, he should have then defined net profits; because the expenses of the trip to Dallas and board there would have been expenses attending the exhibition, and if plaintiff should recover them eo nomine, as already having been paid out, they should be deducted, with the other expenses, from the gross receipts. The admission of the evidence of W. L. Moore, that the plaintiff had refused to sell the collection, was error. By the Act of 1889, amending sections 2 and 6 of the Act of 1887, all moneys that come into the hands of a receiver are made subject, among other obligations, “ to the payment of all claims and accounts against the receiver on contracts made by the receiver during the receivership.” The suit of plaintiff grows out of a claim on a contract to safely transport the plaintiff’s property to Dallas, as stipulated in a bill of lading. Authority to sue the receiver is granted by the statute, and the Act of 1889 makes “all judgments rendered against a receiver on causes of action arising during the receivership ” a lien on all the property in his hands, superior to the mortgage lien. Plaintiff had authority under the statute to sue the receivers upon the cause of action as stated by him. Delivered December 1, 1892. The application for a continuance failed to show what the facts were that constituted due diligence in ascertaining the defense; and it also might have shown that defendants’ counsel informed the sheriff, when he placed the subpoena in his hands, where the witness could be found, as it showed that the witness was a transient person, then temporarily to be found in Fayette; but as the case must be reversed for other errors, we do not pass on the sufficiency of the application further than as indicated, and do not base the reversal on it. For the errors indicated, the judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","B. F. Yoakum et al., Receivers, v. J. B. Dunn. No. 42. 1. Damages for Mental Anguish. — The suit was for damages for injury to a museum, delivered to the defendant for shipment to Dallas for exhibition at the fair, and loss of profits by reason of failure to transport and deliver. The petition alleged that plaintiff “ lost all opportunity to make money at said point by exhibiting his collection of birds, animals, etc., and lost his own time, besides the expense of keeping and paying his employes, and his trouble, vexation, and worry.’’ Plaintiff testified, without objection, that he experienced great mental anxiety on account of the delay of the museum. Under this state of facts, the jury should have been told that the plaintiff could not recover for his mental anguish. 2. Connecting Lines. — The evidence failing to show that the museum was ever out of defendant’s possession, it was not necessary for the plaintiff to show upon what line of railway the damage was done. 3. Measure of Damages. — The measure of damages for the injury to the museum would be the market value of the specimens destroyed, and the difference in value of those injured just before and just after the injury; and if there was no market value at the place where the railway received them, then their market value at the nearest point where they had a market value should be shown. The damage can not be estimated by the time it took the owner to collect them, and the value of his time. 4. Charge on the Weight of Evidence. — It was a charge on the weight of evidence to tell the jury that the articles had no general market value. The evidence as to the nature of the articles, and the manner of their collection and preparation, tended to show that they were all such specimens as might have a market value. 5. Speculative and Uncertain Damages. — The following charge was given: “If you find that by reason of the total or partial loss of some of the articles belonging to the collection or museum, the whole collection is depreciated in value, and rendered unfit for profitable exhibition, you will consider such incidents and results, for the purpose of determining the actual damage you find the plaintiff has sustained.’’ Under the evidence in the case, this charge was error. Such depreciation could only result from a general lessening of interest in the museum, by reason of the loss of certain specimens, and as an element of damage it is too uncertain and speculative. 6. Damages — Lost Profits — The plaintiff notified defendants, when he shipped the museum, of the purpose for which it was being shipped; defendant is therefore liable for such damages as plaintiff might probably sustain by reason of the failure to have the museum there for exhibition, in the way of lost profits; not eo nomine as net profits, but as damages, to be determined by ascertaining the probable net profits. And in this case, the court having authorized the jury to allow plaintiff for expenses incurred by himself and his employes, he should have defined net profits. The expense of the trip to Dallas, and board there, should have been deducted from the gross profits, if recovery of net profits eo nomine was allowed. 7. Suit Against Receivers. — This suit grows out of a contract made by the receivers to safely transport plaintiff’s property to Dallas, and under Revised Statutes, sections 2 and 6 of Act of 1889, plaintiff had the right to sue the receivers. Appeal from Fayette. Tried below before Hon. H. Teicsmueller. S. C. Patton and J. T. Duncan, for appellants. The court erred in charging the jury, to “ consider the value of the articles totally or partially injured and the depreciation in value of articles not injured by reason of the loss or unfitness for use of such other articles injured and belonging to the collection. Railway v. Simcock, 81 Texas, 503; Railway v. Curry, 64 Texas, 87. Phelps & Wilrich, for appellee. 1. The net profits were a proper basis for a recovery, for the reason that defendants had been notified by the plaintiff, at time of shipment, of the object of shipment, and his reasons for desiring the museum rushed through. 2. Appellee was entitled to recover net profits, and also all his actual expenses paid out by him for himself and employes while at Dallas, and expenses of going there and returning. Railway v. Hill, 63 Texas, 385."
"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This action was brought in the County Court of Galveston County upon an appeal bond executed by the appellees in the case of Gregory v. Allison, tried in the Justice Court. The facts are, as found by the county judge on the trial below, as follows: “1. On July 29, 1889, the plaintiff, W. W. Gregory, recovered a judgment against one J. G. Allison in the Justice Court of Galveston County, Texas, precinct number 1, for the sum of $126, besides costs of suit, with interest on said judgment from its date at the rate of 8 per cent per annum; from which judgment said Allison appealed to the County Court of Galveston County, and filed a bond as an appeal bond, properly describing said judgment, in the sum of $300, with the defendants J. G. Goldthwaite and W. F. Breath as sureties. The said bond is payable to the plaintiff, Gregory, in said sum, and is “conditioned that the said J. G. Allison, appellant, shall prosecute his appeal with effect and shall pay all the costs which have accrued in the court below or which may accrue in the appellate court.” These were all the conditions of said bond. The bond was approved and filed by the justice of the peace July 31, 1889, and in due course of law the said justice of the peace made a transcript of the proceedings in said cause against said Allison, and transmitted same, together with the papers in the cause, to the County Court of Galveston County. “2. On motion of said Gregory in the County Court of Galveston County, the said appeal of Allison was, on November 20, 1889, dismissed, because said bond was not conditioned as required by the statute, and writ of procedendo ordered to issue. From the judgment dismissing said appeal said Allison appealed to the Court of Appeals of Texas. The appeal to the Court of Appeals was upon a cost bond. “3. At the Galveston Term, 1890, the honorable Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the County Court dismissing said appeal, and mandate was issued March 11, 1890. “ 4. Said W. W. Gregory sued J. G. Goldthwaite and W. F. Breath, the sureties on said appeal bond from said Justice Court to said County Court, and defendants herein, in the Justice Court for precinct number 1, Galveston County, on October 13, 1890, alleging and proving that since the execution of said appeal bond in said cause number 2556, the defendant, J. G. Allison, had become notoriously insolvent, and that the judgment in said cause number 2556 for the sum of $126 and interest thereon from July 29, 1889, at 8 per cent per annum, and costs, was still due and unpaid, and no part thereof was paid. “5. The evidence showed that said Gregory exercised diligence in endeavoring to collect said judgment of $126 and interest and costs aforesaid, in that he caused execution to issue promptly after the judgment of .affirmance in said Court of Appeals, and subsequently caused execution to issue to Dallas County, where said Allison removed shortly after the judgment was obtained against him in said Justice Court, and that although said Gregory exercised such diligence, no property was found belonging to said Allison subject to execution.” Our conclusion is that the judgment of the court below ought to be affirmed. The appeal bond sued on was not good as a statutory bond, and an action could be maintained on it, if at all, only as a voluntary common law bond, as upon a contract between the parties. It is clear that the minds of the parties never met in a contract. On the contrary, the appeal to the County Court in the case of Gregory v. Allison was dismissed on the motion of Gregory, because no sufficient bond had been filed. We are cited to the cases of Trent v. Rhomberg, 66 Texas, 249, and Wooldridge v. Rawlings, 14 Southwestern Reporter, 667; but in both of those cases the bonds were good statutory bonds; and in the first case the appeal was dismissed for the want of prosecution, while in the latter the appellant consented to the dismissal. The suit must be maintained either because the bond was a good statutory bond or good as a voluntary common law bond. As a statutory bond, it was only a bond for costs on appeal from the District or County Court to the appellate court (Revised Statutes, article 1400); and not at all conditioned as required by law for an appeal from the Justice Court. Rev. Stats., art. 1639. It was not good as a voluntary common law bond, because it was never agreed to or ratified by the plaintiff. Wooters v. Smith, 56 Texas, 198.

Liability of Sureties on Insufficient Appeal Bond.—A bond for appeal from the Justice Court to the County Court was given by one Allison, which was not conditioned as required by law, and in the County Court the appeal was dismissed, on motion of appellant, for want of a sufficient bond, and procedendo to enforce the justice judgment awarded. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals upon a cost bond the judgment of dismissal was affirmed, and execution was promptly issued by appellant against Allison, when he was found insolvent. Thereupon, this suit upon the appeal bond from the Justice Court was filed against the sureties thereon to recover the amount of the appellant's judgment against Allison. Held, the bond was not good as a statutory bond, not being conditioned as required by law. and not good as á voluntary common law bond, because it was never agreed to or ratified by appellant, and recovery is denied. Appeal from Galveston. Tried below before Hon. William B. Lock-hart, County Judge. S. S. Hanscomb, for appellant.

"KEY, Associate Justice. 1. Error was committed by the trial court in stating to the jury the issues involved, in omitting to state some oí the defenses interposed by appellant. But this was an omission, and if appellant was not satisfied with it, a special charge should have been asked supplying the defect. 2. After submitting appellee’s theory of the case, as alleged in her petition, the court instructed the jury as follows: “If, however, you believe the defendant corporation did, and had done, all that could be required to render said bridge secure and safe for the passage of trains, and that the destruction of said bridge and the death of said Horace Daniels was the result of an unprecedented rainfall, and of such a character that no human foresight or skill could provide against, you will find for the defendant.” This charge is complained of, among other reasons, because it required of appellant a higher degree of care for the safety of its employes than is imposed by law. This objection is well taken, and must result in a reversal of the case. A master, whether a common carrier or not, is only required to exercise ordinary and reasonable care for the protection of his servants. Our Supreme Court, in considering the liabilities of railway companies to their employes, has frequently applied this doctrine, and held that in furnishing appliances for their use, or in constructing and keeping in repair road beds and bridges, the true test of liability is, whether or not reasonable and ordinary care was exercised; in other words, whether or not the railroad company was guilty of negligence. Railway v. Oram, 49 Texas, 341; Railway v. Lyde, 57 Texas, 505; Railway v. McCarthy, 64 Texas, 632; Railway v. Bell, 75 Texas, 50. Ordinary care is such care as an ordinarily prudent man would exercise under the circumstances; and a failure to exercise such care is negligence. This charge required the jury, before they could return a verdict for appellant, to find, first, that it did all that could be required to render the bridge secure and safe for the passage of trains; and second, that the destruction of the bridge and the death of appellee’s husband was the result of an unprecedented rainfall, and of such a character that no human foresight or skill could provide against. , The first part of this charge, though not accurate, as it omits the word “reasonably” before the word “required,” certainly stated and submitted all that the law required of appellant, and it was error to state, as an additional prerequisite to a verdict for appellant, that the jury must also find that there was an unprecedented rainfall, and especially to require them to find that the rainfall was of such a character as no human foresight or sTcill could provide against. Even if the question of an unprecedented rainfall had been submitted disjunctively, the language in which it was submitted did not state the law correctly in cases of this kind. It must be borne in mind that the injured party was appellant’s employe; that when he entered the service in which he was engaged at the time of his death, he assumed all of the risks and hazards ordinarily incident to such service; that appellant is not liable to appellee for damages resulting from his death, unless the same was caused by appellant’s negligence, as set out in appellee’s petition, and that the burden rested upon appellee to prove, and not upon appellant to disprove, such negligence. In cases of loss or injury to freight while in the custody of a common carrier, the rule is different. In such cases the carrier is an insurer, and when sued for loss of or damage to freight received by it for transportation, all the plaintiff has to show is the delivery of his freight to the carrier, its loss or damage, and its value or the extent of the injury; and then the burden is cast upon the carrier to show such facts as will relieve it from liability. And it is generally in this class of cases that the rules of law which determine liability for loss or injury resulting from natural phenomena, called in the law books 1: the acts of God,” are discussed. This arises out of the fact that in such cases proof of the utmost care and diligence will not excuse the carrier, and the acts of God and a few other special defenses are the only grounds upon which nonliability can be established. Laws, on Cont. of Carr., 5. In the present case, it is true that appellant averred in its answer that the accident which caused the death of appellee’s husband was occasioned by an act of God, consisting of an unprecedented rainfall, which no human agency could have foreseen or prevented. But this was not all of its answer. It pleaded a general denial, and especially denied all charges of negligence. The general denial was all that it was necessary for it to plead to avail itself of the rules of law governing the liability of a railway company to its employes, as announced in the cases above cited; and the fact that it went further, and averred that the injury complained of was caused by the act of God, did not change the rules of law applicable to the case. The correct test of appellant’s liability was whether or not it had been guilty of negligence as charged. And having filed a general denial, the burden was on appellee to prove negligence; and any evidence tending to disprove it, whether it showed that the accident resulted from an act of God or not, was admissible under the general denial. Appellant asked, and the court gave, a special charge in reference to the alleged freshet, which was correct; but it did not cure the vice in the main charge, because they were in conflict, and the jury could not know which was the better law. Railway v. Robinson, 73 Texas, 277. The other complaints as to charges given are not well founded. 3. Appellant has several assignments of error based upon the refusal of the court below to give instructions asked, which in effect attempt to maintain the doctrine that if appellant selected ordinarily careful and competent employes to construct and maintain the bridge upon which the accident occurred, or exercised ordinary care in selecting said employes, and did not itself know, and by the exercise of ordinary diligence could not have known, of the insecure condition of the bridge, then it would not be liable. The statute allowing suits for injuries resulting in death has been amended since this suit was brought, but at the time in question it gave a cause of action when the death of any person was caused by the negligence or carelessness of any proprietor, owner, charterer, or hirer of any railway, steamboat, or stage coach, or other vehicle for the conveyance of goods or passengers, or by the unfitness or gross negligence or carelessness of their servants or agents. The apjiellee’s cause of action, as disclosed by her petition, is founded upon the alleged negligence of appellant in the construction and maintenance of the bridge, and not upon the negligence, ordinary or gross, of its servants or agents. The law imposed the duty upon appellant to construct and properly maintain all necessary bridges on its railway; and if it failed to do so, it can not escape liability because its employes to whom it had delegated the performance of these duties, personal to itself, were guilty of negligence, nor because it had exercised due care in selecting such employes. Such negligence, as against the injured employe, was held in Railway v. Dunham, 49 Texas, 181, to be the negligence of the railway company, and not of the fellow servant; and we think the same doctrine applies to this case. The case of Hendrick v. Walton, 69 Texas, 192, referred to in appellant’s brief, is not analogous. There was no averment in that ease that the defendant had failed to discharge any duty he owed to the plaintiff, but the charge was that his deputy (the agent) had committed a wrongful act which resulted in death. The assignments of error that raise this question are not maintainable. 4. It appears that appellee served notice on appellant to take the deposition of Charles Miner ly; that appellant filed cross-interrogatories to the witness; that a commission was issued and returned with a deposition signed and sworn to by Charles Mmley. Appellant objected to this deposition being read as evidence, upon the ground that no notice to take said deposition had been served upon it, and no commission had issued to take said witness’ deposition. This objection was correctly overruled. In our judgment, the two names are idem sonans. Besides, appellant crossed the interrogatories, and it is not made to appear that any injustice resulted to it. We do not think that the same strictness, in excluding testimony because of a variance, should apply in matters of this kind as is properly applied in many other instances. Delivered December 14, 1892. 5. A. F. Dignowity, John Gilerease, and Charles Emley, nonexpert witnesses, were permitted, over appellant’s objections, to state their opinions as to what caused the bridge to break down, producing the wreck which resulted in the death of Horace Daniels. All of these witnesses stated the facts upon which their opinions were based, which brought their testimony, except a part of Charles Emley’s, hereafter referred to, within the exception to the general rules which exclude the opinions of nonexpert witnesses. Railway v. Jarrard, 65 Texas, 560; Railway v. Locker, 78 Texas, 279; Whart. Ev., secs. 511, 513. The witness Charles Emley was permitted to state, as his opinion, that had the timbers of the bridge been larger and sound, the bridge would have been sufficient for the uses of the railway company, except in extraordinary rainfalls. The rule allowing nonexpert witnesses to give opinions based upon facts within their own knowledge, and stated to the jury or court trying the case, ought not to be extended so as to allow the witness to indulge in argument, or state how, in his opinion, the particular thing ought to have been, unless required to do so in an answer to questions on cross-examination. We think this part of Emley’s testimony should have been excluded. 6. The question based upon the ruling of the court in permitting appellee to enter a remittitur after appellant’s motion for a new trial had been overruled will not be considered, as it is not likely to arise again. Nor shall we pass on the assignment of error asserting that the verdict is not supported by the evidence. The judgment is reversed and cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company v. Bridget Daniels. No. 47. 1. Omission in Charge — Practice. — A mere omission in the charge in stating the issues involved, not called to the attention of the trial court, is not a ground for reversal. 2. Master and Servant — Care — Negligence. — A master, whether a common carrier or not, is only required to exercise ordinary and reasonable care for the protection of his servants. This rule is applicable to the duty of a railway company in constructing and maintaining bridges upon its line, in suit for damages for death of an employe. 3. Unprecedented Rainfall — Charge of Court. — The trial court charged the jury: “If, however, you believe the defendant did and had done all that could be required to render said bridge secure and safe for the passage of trains, and that the destruction of said bridge and the death of said-was the result of an unprecedented rainfall, and of such a character that no human foresight could have provided against, you will And for the defendant.” This charge is erroneous: 1. In requiring a greater degree of care on part of the defendant than reasonable care for safety of its employes. 2. In adding conjunctively the finding that the death was caused by an unprecedented rainfall. 3. The charge touching the rainfall was not in terms correct; it imposed upon defendant the burden of proof, while it devolved upon the plaintiff' to show want of care. 4. Act of God. — To rebut the charge of negligence which may be put in issue by the general denial, or by specially pleading matters negativing negligence. it is competent to show that the act complained of was of inevitable necessity, act of God. etc. 5. Contradictory Charges. — An erroneous charge upon a material issue is not cured by a contradictory charge given at request of the party injured by such charge. 6. Neglect by Railway Company. — The law imposes upon a railway company the duty to construct and maintain all necessary bridges upon its route; and if it failed to do so, it can not escape liability because its employes, charged with such duty, were guilty of negligence, nor because it had exercised due care in selecting its employes. 7. Idem Sonans. — Emerly and Emley are idem sonans. So held where interrogatories were filed and crossed to take depositions of Emerly when the commission was returned with depositions of Emley. 8.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Action of trespass to try title to recover an undivided interest of five-twenty-fourths in the south half of the Mumford House league and labor of land, situated in De Witt County, Texas, brought by appellant Shela Randolph, joined by her husband, W. H. Randolph. Plaintiffs claim the land in the separate right of Mrs. Randolph to one-sixth thereof as the heir of- her mother, Matilda House, the deceased wife of Mumford House, and one-twenty-fourth thereof as the heir of her deceased brother, Travis House. Defendants claim title to the land under a deed of conveyance from Mumford House to W. R. Baker, made after the death of Matilda House, and say that they had no knowledge of Mrs. House or the plaintiffs, or that they had any interest in the land. Also, that after his conveyance to Baker, Mumford House settled with his daughter, Shela Randolph, for her mother’s interest in the land in controversy, by conveyance to her of other real and personal property. The case was tried by the court without a jury, and judgment was rendered for the defendants. No conclusions of fact and of law were filed by the court below. 1. Mumford House and Matilda McCurly were married prior to 1836, and lived together as husband and wife until 1847, when the wife died. She left as her sole heirs the three children of herself and her said husband, to-wit, Joe M., Travis, and Shela. Travis died without issue, intestate, in the year 1861. Shela married plaintiff W. H. Randolph in January, 1857. Mumford House married again, and died in 1882, leaving children by his second wife. 2. The land in controversy is an undivided interest of five-twenty-fourths in the south or lower half of one league and one labor, situated in De Witt County, Texas, patented to Mumford House, his heirs and assigns, on December 8, 1847. The patent contains no mention of the certificate and no recital that it was issued to House as the head of a family. A certificate was issued to House as the head of a family for one league and one labor of land, dated March 2,1838, by the Board of Land Commissioners of Harris County; and on October 9, 1845, a duplicate certificate was issued to him on proof of loss of the certificate issued March 2, 1838. 3. January 17, 1846, Mumford House made a contract in writing with John York to “clear out” his “lieadright league and labor” on halves, and to receive a patent from the Land Office for the same. Said contract was recorded in the record of deeds for De Witt County, July 24, 1854. 4. December 24, 1854, Mumford House executed power of attorney to R. House to convey one-lialf of the league and labor to York’s heirs. The instrument recited, “that whereas John York in his lifetime did locate in De Witt County for me one league and labor of land, to which I was entitled as a colonist under the Mexican Government,” and proceeded to authorize the conveyance. It was recorded in the record of deeds for De Witt County, June 2, 1855. 5. Mumford House, by his attorney in fact, R. House, conveyed by metes and bounds one-half of said league and labor to the heirs of John York, which, though not designated as such, was the upper or north half. This deed is dated January 11, 1855, and was recorded in the record of deeds for De Witt County on June 2, 1855. It contained the following recital: “ Containing one-lialf of the survey of one league and labor patented to me as a colonist under the Mexican Government.” 6. On June 30, 1857, Mumford House conveyed to W. R. Baker, for consideration of 85000 cash, as expressed in deed, but an actual consideration of land in Ellis County exchanged therefor, one-half of the following described league and labor of land: “Being the south or lower half, and the half not heretofore conveyed to one York, situated on the back lines of the surveys on the Guadalupe, about 23 miles northwest of Victoria, and granted to Mumford House by patent No. 177, volume 7, dated December, A. D. 1847, said land lying on Five Mile Creek; and for a more full description said patent is made a part of this deed. ’ ’ There is no covenant of seisin contained in the deed, and the warranty is limited to those claiming “by or through” the grantor, being a special warranty deed. It was recorded in De Witt County, November 14,1873; but the record is only partial, there being some portions of the deed omitted. No authority in House to sell his wife’s community interest after her death was shown by proof of administration or of community debts. 7. On October 29, 1873, W. R. Baker conveyed to D. B. Peavy as follows: “The south or lower half, and the half not sold by Mumford House to one York, of one league and labor of land granted by the State of Texas to Mumford House by patent No. 177, volume 7, dated December 8, 1847, and conveyed by M. House to Baker by deed dated June 30, 1857, which deed and patent are herewith delivered and made part of this deed, and reference is made to them for full description.” This deed was duly recorded November 14, 1873. 8. Defendants Junker and others bought their respective tracts from Peavy at various dates subsequent to his purchase from Baker. 9. When Baker bought the land from House he did not know whether House was a married man, or the head of a family, or not, and had no knowledge of his having had a wife who was déad, nor of any children by such wife. Nor did Peavy nor any of the defendants ever have knowledge that Mumford House was or had been a married man, or the head of a family, or that his wife was dead, or of the existence of the plaintiff, until the institution of this suit. 10. In the year 1861, Mumford House gave his three children by the said Matilda each 200 acres of land out of the land in Ellis County which he received from W. R. Baker in exchange for the land in controvery, also 100 head of cattle, 25 head of horses, and to Mrs. Randolph a negro boy, which he considered equal to their interest in the De Witt County land, in settlement of said interest; but the deed to Mrs. Randolph was not executed until 1870, on account of the pendency of some legal proceedings about the Ellis County land. Afterward Mrs. Randolph, joined by her husband, sold and conveyed the 200 acres that she received to one W. C. Stalworth. 11. The deed from Mumford House to Mrs. Randolph for the land conveyed to her recited that it was in consideration of love for his daughter, and concluded with the recital, “it being her distributive share of my real estate.” Mrs. Randolph never executed any deed or release to her father, nor to any one else, for any interest to the land in controversy, in consideration of such settlement, nor for any other consideration. 1. We find, upon the authority of Hill v. Moore, 62 Texas, 610, that the size of the survey granted to Mumford House, being one league and labor, was sufficient to put the vendees of said House upon notice of the equitable rights of the wife of said House in the land, because a league and labor of land could only be granted to the head of a family, and the head of a family implied marriage and a wife. This being true, the defendants would have to take notice of every other fact necessary to protect the interest of Mrs. Randolph, as the death of her mother, and her consequent heirship. It will not be necessary to inquire whether the defendants would be bound by the recitals in the deeds and other instruments in the York title, as we have held that the size of the grant itself is sufficient to give notice of the equitable interest of Mrs. Randolph in the land. Although these instruments were collateral to the chain of title under which the appellants claimed, it was contended by them- that the recital in the deed to W. R. Baker by Mumford House, that he conveyed the “half not heretofore conveyed to one York,” and did not convey by metes and bounds, while the York deed was by metes and bounds, directed the defendants to the deed to York, which would have shown that the land was patented to House as a colonist. 2. For the purpose of showing a settlement by Mumford House with the plaintiff Mrs. Randolph, for her interest in her mother’s estate, defendants were permitted to put in evidence a deed to M. and W. R. House for the land in Ellis County; the petition in partition suit of House v. Beauchamp, administrator of W. R. House; deed from M. House to Shela Randolph; deed from Shela Randolph and husband, W. H. Randolph, to N. C. Stalworth; and the testimony of Jo. M. House and W. A. House, which were admitted over the objections of the plaintiffs, substantially that: (1) Defendants as privies of M. House were estopped froln denying the recital in the deed from M. House to Shela Randolph, showing the purpose of the deed. (2) Because there being no covenant of seisin in the deed from House to Baker, and the warranty being restricted to a special warranty, the after-acquired title of House by virtue of the settlement would not enure to the benefit of the defendants. (3) That if any title passed to House by virtue of the settlement, it was an equitable title, with which the defendants did not connect themselves. (4) It was not shown that the defendants relied on the settlement. (5) Mrs. Randolph being a married woman, could not be estopped without fraud on her part, which was not shown. (6) That the settlement was in conflict with article 548, Revised Statutes, and statutes regulating conveyances by married women. We do not think there was any error in the admission of the evidence. The defendants were not bound by the recital in the deed from House to his daughter, that the land was her distributive share of his real estate. Evidence was admissible to show what the transaction really was. Howard v. Davis, 6 Texas, 174; Hicks v. Morris, 57 Texas, 661. Mrs. Randolph owned an equitable interest in the land, and her father held the legal title for the benefit of himself and the heirs of his wife, subject to the community obligations. In such cases it has been uniformly held in this State, that without administration the survivor may sell the real estate belonging to the community estate for the purpose of discharging the debts against the community. But if the survivor sells the community property without authority, the heirs of the deceased parent would be entitled to recover one-half, less the value of such property as they had received from such surviving parent. Taken in connection with the evidence that the conveyance by Mumford House to Mrs. Randolph was in settlement of her interest in the community estate of her mother in the De Witt County land, such conveyance was in discharge of House’s obligation to the community incurred by the sale of the land. Delivered December 1, 1892. The conveyance to Mrs. Randolph would be prima facie in discharge of such obligation. Sparks v. Spence, 40 Texas, 694; Belcher v. Fox, 60 Texas, 527; Burleson v. Burleson, 28 Texas, 418. Although the defendants took the conveyance of land with constructive notice of the plaintiff’s equitable interest as an heir of Mrs. House, still she will not be permitted to retain the proceeds of the settlement for that interest and recover the same of the defendant without restoration of such proceeds, notwithstanding the fact that it may not have been conveyed in the manner prescribed by the statute in which a married woman should convey her property. Our decisions on the subject are all to the effect, that whenever the heirs of the deceased partner of the marital partnership have received property amounting to their share of the property belonging to the community estate, their equitable title to the remainder stands discharged. We do not think it is a question of estoppel, in which it would be necessary to show fraud on the part of Mrs. Randolph in order to invoke the principle, but it is rather a settlement by the trustee of the legal title with the cestui que trust for her equitable interest therein. Although the vendee, Baker, took the legal title of House, charged with the equitable interest of Mrs. Randolph, the settlement with Mrs. Randolph discharged the land of this equity, and it enured to the benefit of House’s vendees. If the doctrine of after-acquired title should be held to be involved, that is now settled in this State against the contention of appellants. Lindsay v. Freeman, 83 Texas, 263. The deed of House to Baker, and the subsequent conveyance by him to appellees’ vendor, was sufficient to connect them with whatever equity House may have acquired. The one-twenty-fourth interest claimed by Mrs. Randolph as the heir of her brother Travis, would attach to the property received by him in the settlement with his father, and not to the land in controversy. We are of the opinion that there was no error in the record, and the judgment of the court below will be affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Pleasants did not sit in this ease.","W. H. Randolph and Wife v. John Junker et al. No. 42. 1. Notice that Land is Community Property — The survey granted to Mumford House, being one league and one labor of land, was sufficient to put vendees of House on notice of the equitable rights of the plaintiff in the land. Such a grant could only be made to the head of a family, and that implies marriage and a wife. 2. Evidence to Show Settlement with Heir of Deceased Parent. This suit was by the daughter of House by a deceased wife. House had sold the community land in controversy, after the death of his wife, and without administration upon her estate. To prove a settlement by the father with the daughter, defendants were properly allowed to show the chain of title to a tract of land in Ellis County to the father, and deed from the father to the daughter, after the death of his wife, to 200 acres of that land, and sale of the 200 acres of land by the daughter and her husband to a third party. The deed from the father to the daughter recited, “ it being her distributive share of my estate.” 3. Sale of Community by Survivor. — The daughter owned an equitable interest in the land, of which the father held the legal title for himself and the heirs of his deceased wife, subject to community obligations. In such case, the survivor may sell the property for the purpose of discharging community debts; but if he sells without authority, the heirs of the deceased parent would be entitled to recover one-half, less the value of such property as they had received from the surviving parent. The conveyance to the daughter in this case must be held to be prima facie in discharge of such obligation. 4. Heirs of Deceased Parent, how Concluded. — Though defendants bought with notice of the daughter’s equitable interest as heir of her mother, she will not be permitted to retain the proceeds of the settlement for that interest, and recover the same of defendants, without restoring such proceeds. Although her interest in the De Witt County lands may not have been conveyed in the manner prescribed by statute for the conveyance by married women, our decisions are to the effect, that when heirs receive property amounting to their share of the community, their equitable title to the remainder is discharged. 5. Deed without Warranty Passes After-acquired Title. — A deed with restrictive warranty against all persons claiming under the grantor, will convey after-acquired title. Appeal from De Witt. Tried below before Hon. H. Clay Pleasants. Proctor & Proctor, for appellants. 1. The court erred in holding defendants to be bona fide purchasers without notice, since the patent to Mumford House for such quantity of land as a league and labor put defendants, as reasonably prudent men, upon such inquiry as would have advised them of plaintiff Sliela Randolph’s title. Edwards v. Brown, 68 Texas, 332; Hill v. Moore, 62 Texas, 614; Const. 1836, sec. 10, Gen. Prov.; Pasch. Dig., arts. 4140, 4149, 4158, 4159; Republic v. Skidmore, 2 Texas, 265; Slayton v.

The defense of appellees, that Sliela Randolph received the Ellis County land in settlement of her interest in her mother’s estate, was a defense directly attacking the purpose of M. House’s deed to Shela Randolph, as expressed in said deed. The particular recital, “it being her 'distributive share of my real estate,” was a recital showing the purpose of said deed, and as such recital was conclusive upon appellees. 2 Dev. on Deeds, secs. 992-997; Stowe v. Wyse, 18 Am. Dec., 102; 2 Stark, on Ev., 30; 1 Greenl. Ev., 22-24; 1 Phill. Ev., 410; Huntington v. Hawes, 5 Johns. Ch., 26; 1 Stark. Ev., 305; Rich v. Atwater, 16 Conn., 415; Williams v. Robinson, 16 Conn., 524; Fairtitle d’Mytton v. Gilbert, 2 T. R., 169-179; Palmer v. Elkins, 2 Stra., 1817. 3. Such a warranty as in this deed, restricted as same was to persons claiming by or through Mumford House, would not pass to appellees even a title subsequently acquired from a stranger by Mumford House; a fortiori, same would not pass such an equity as Mumford House acquired from Shela Randolph by virtue of such settlement.

The deed from Mumford House to Shela Randolph, conveying 200 acres of land, and using the expression, “it being her distributive share of my real estate,” must be construed to mean really plaintiff’s distributive share in her mother’s estate.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellant, a citizen of Georgia, sued appellee, a citizen of the same State, in the County Court of Montgomery County, on certain promissory notes, alleging that appellee owned a tract of land situated in that county, which was described in the petition, and praying for the issuance of an attachment to be levied upon it. The writ was duly issued and levied upon the land, and personal notice was served on appellee in Georgia, as provided by statute. He appeared and excepted to the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground that the petition showed that both plaintiff and defendant were nonresidents, and the court had no jurisdiction over their persons and none to foreclose an attachment lien on land, and could therefore acquire none over the property attached. On the same day he filed a motion to quash the attachment upon the same ground; and also filed another answer, in which he demurred to and answered the petition on its merits. In both the two first mentioned pleadings he stated that he appeared for the purposes expressed therein alone, and in his other answer he stated that it was filed without any intention of waiving his other pleas, and that he thus answered to the merits only in the event they should be overruled. The court sustained the plea to the jurisdiction, and entered judgment dismissing the cause, from which this appeal is prosecuted. The ruling of the County Court was probably based upon decisions of the Court of Appeals, as formerly constituted, holding that the County Court had no jurisdiction to foreclose attachment liens on land. 2 Will-son’s C. C., 126-297. ■ The Supreme Court has never held to that view of the law, a conflict having existed on that point between its decisions and those of the Court, of Appeals. Hillebrand v. McMahan, 59 Texas, 450. A statute was passed to remedy the difficulty, the effect of which we need not consider, inasmuch as we think it proper to follow on this question the rulings of the Supreme Court, and to hold that the County Court had jurisdiction to cause the levy of its writs upon land, and to enforce the levy by foreclosure of liens thereby created. Say les’ Civ. Stats., art. 180a. One nonresident, by an attachment proceeding, may subject the property of another nonresident, who is his debtor, to the payment of his debt in any court of competent jurisdiction in this State. Ward v. Lathrop, 11 Texas, 287; Wells on Jur., sec. 114. By the levy of its writ the court acquired jurisdiction over the property, and could subject it to the payment of such debt as the plaintiff might establish. Counsel for appellant claims that by pleading as he did, the defendant entered an appearance such as gave the court jurisdiction over his person; and under the construction which our statutory provisions prescribing the effect of an answer have received from the courts, we are of the opinion that his position is well taken. If the County Court had in fact been without jurisdiction to foreclose the attachment lien, and the pleading had only been such as was proper to secure the release oí an illegal levy, a different question would be presented, which we need not determine. This levy was made under a writ issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction, and brought the property within the proper control of the court for the purpose of subjecting it to the debt. The pleadings filed were no less voluntary than were those in the cases in which the filing of pleas to the jurisdiction have been held to constitute an appearance. York v. The State, 73 Texas, 657; 137 U. S., 15; Sam v. Hochstadler, 76 Texas, 162. The County Court, therefore, has jurisdiction not only to subject the property, but to render such personal judgment as the facts may require. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 30, 1893.","T. J. Grizzard v. B. W. Brown. No. 209. 1. County Court May Foreclose Attachment Liens on Land.— A citizen of Georgia sued another citizen of that State in the County Court of Montgomery County, Texas, to recover upon promissory notes, and foreclose an attachment upon land in said county. The County Court had jurisdiction to cause the levy of the writ upon the land, and to enforce the levy by foreclosure. 2. Right of Nonresident to Sue Nonresident.—One nonresident may, by attachment proceeding, subject the property of another nonresident, who is his debtor, to the payment of his debt, in any court of competent jurisdiction in this State. By the levy of its writ the court acquires jurisdiction over the property, and could subject it to the payment of such debt as the plaintiff might establish. 3. Appearance by Nonresident.—Defendant appeared and excepted to the jurisdiction of the court, and moved to quash the attachment, stating that he appeared for the purposes expressed therein alone; and in his other answer he stated that it was filed without any intention of waving his other pleas, and that he thus answered to the merits only in the event they should be overruled. This pleading of the defendant entered an appearance, and gave the court jurisdiction over his person. Appeal from Montgomery. Tried below before Hon. N. O. Cravens, County Judge. B. H. Powell, for appellant. 1. The County Court has jurisdiction to foreclose an attachment lien on realty in a proceeding in rem pending in said court in amount within jurisdictional limits of said court, and to fix and maintain an attachment lien on realty, to hold it to abide the judgment rendered by said court in any proceeding pending in said court for an amount within the jurisdictional limits of said court. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 180a; 59 Texas, 450. 2. The filing of a motion to quash service and answer, or either of them, by a party defendant in a suit, though he be a nonresident, is a voluntary surrender on his part to the jurisdiction of the court for all purposes; and the motion to quash, though properly sustained, does not in law dismiss the cause of action, but only operates as a continuance, leaving said cause of action properly in court as an appearance case next term. 73 Texas, 651; 76 Texas, 164; 77 Texas, 126. No brief for appellee reached the Reporter."
"COLLARD, Associate Justice. The statement of the nature and result of the suit made by plaintiffs in error is correct, and is accepted by the defendants in error. It is as follows: “ This suit, in form an action of trespass to try title to about 1700 acres of land in G-illespie county, Texas, was brought in the District Court of said county February 10, 1887, by plaintiffs in error against Kramer and Hardt, defendants in error. February 24, 1887, defendants answered by general demurrer, general denial, and plea of not guilty. September 23, 1887, the court granted leave to defendants to make their warrantor, J. I. Neely, party defendant. February 21, 1888, said Neely appeared and filed an answer, making himself party defendant, and setting up, in substance, that at the time he sold the land in controversy to his codefendants Kramer and Hardt, to-wit, on June 19, 1886, he was possessed of the legal title to it, which he had acquired without any notice of the claim or rights of plaintiffs, and for a valuable consideration; that he sold said lands to defendants Kramer and Hardt for a valuable consideration, and that at no time prior to the filing of this suit did he or they have any notice of the claims or rights of plaintiffs, etc. February 27, 1888, plaintiffs filed their supplemental petition, in which they denied the allegations made by Neely, and averred that he sold said land to his codefendants on a credit, and had not received payment of the price or purchase money therefor, to-wit, the sum of $3800, agreed upon by the defendants; that said sum of $3800 is still due to said defendant (Neely) from his codefendants for said land; that defendants, at the time of their purchase, had notice that said land was held in trust by Mary A. Tate for plaintiffs, who were the owners thereof, and they prayed as in their original petition; ‘and further, in case they may not be entitled to recover said land, then that that they have judgment against said defendants for the unpaid purchase money, and interest thereon; also that they have such other and further relief as their case may require.’ On the 28th of February, 1888, the case was tried by the court, a jury being waived, and judgment was rendered that plaintiffs take nothing of defendants, etc. This judgment was duly excepted to, and notice of appeal given by plaintiffs, and ten days were allowed within which, after adjournment, to make and file statement of facts. Findings of facts and conclusions of law were filed by the court, and a statement of facts was approved and filed on the 8th of March, 1888.” The plaintiffs have brought the case into this court for revision by writ of error, and assigned errors as follows: The second assignment of error: “ The court erred in the conclusions of law and fact found, and especially: “1. In finding as a fact (section 5) that Mrs. M. A. Tate conveyed to J. I. Neely the land in controversy, when all the evidence relating thereto, given by said Tate and defendant Neely, with Neely’s letters, and conclusions of the court in section 10, show that both said parties fully intended and understood the deed to be only a quitclaim of whatever right she might have to the land, and not a conveyance of the land, said land being worth, as shown, $3600, and the price paid by said J. I. Neely to Mrs. M. A. Tate being only $100. “2. In finding as facts (section 6, et seq.) that defendant Neely conveyed to the other defendants by warranty deeds the land sued for, and thereby vested in said codefendants the legal title to said land, when, as the evidence shows, said Neely only made a conditional contract to sell the land to his codefendants, and that codefendants had paid only a small fraction of the agreed purchase price for the land, and were wholly in default as to the entire balance, thereby renouncing claim or title to the land. “ 3. In finding as law (sections 2 and 3, conclusions of law) that the deed from Mrs. M. A. Tate to defendant J. I. Neely vested in said Neely the title to the entire tract of land sued for, ‘ and the defendants Kramer and Hardt could not be affected by understandings, etc., between said Tate and Neely,’ since it was shown by all the evidence relating thereto, viz., the evidence of said Neely and Tate, and the contracts of sale by said Neely to his codefendants, that defendant Neely bought only such claim as Mrs. M. A. Tate might have, paid only $100 therefor, when the market value of the land was $3660 at least, and that defendants Kramer and Hardt had paid only $530 of said market value, made default as to the balance, and forfeited or relinquished all claim to the land.” The third assignment of error: “ The judgment rendered in this cause is erroneous, contrary to the law and the evidence adduced, in that it is for the defendants when it should have been for the plaintiffs for at least seven-eighths of its value, as prayed for in plaintiffs’ first supplemental petition, as is shown by all the evidence adduced on the trial, and especially by the evidence and conclusions of fact hereinbefore specified.” The court’s findings of facts and conclusions of law are as follows: Findings of Facts. — “ 1. In 1873 plaintiffs and their mother, Mrs. M. A. Tate, were the heirs of Waddy Tate, Jr., and each entitled to an equal share of his estate. “2. In a suit had between plaintiffs herein and Mrs. M. A. Tate as heirs of Waddy Tate, Jr., who was one of the heirs of Waddy Tate, Sr., and the other heirs of said Waddy Tate, Sr., J. C. Brown was appointed receiver, and ordered to sell the property belonging to the estate of Waddy Tate, Sr., for partition. “3. At this sale, had in 1874, the premises in controversy were bid in by the attorney of M. A. Tate and her children, the plaintiffs herein, and the purchase money for same charged against their joint interest in the estate of Waddy Tate, Sr. “4. By direction of the attorney for plaintiffs and Mrs. M. A. Tate, a deed for this premises was executed by said receiver, J. C. Brown, to Mrs. M. A. Tate alone, which deed was recorded in Gillespie County, December 22, 1875. “5. On November 26, 1884, Mrs. M. A. Tate conveyed the premises conveyed to her by said Brown to defendant J. I. Neely, by deed with special warranty of persons claiming by, through, or under her, which deed was recorded in Gillespie County on April 25, 1885. “6. On June 19,1886, defendant J. I. Neely conveyed by general warranty deeds, retaining, however, vendor’s lien, to defendant Oscar Kramer 640 acres of the premises conveyed to him by Mrs. M. A. Tate, and to Herman Hardt the balance of said premises. “ 7. On February 10, 1887, plaintiffs filed this suit. “8. In 1878 the land was sold for taxes, and taxes have ever since been paid by purchaser at tax sale, and after he conveyed his claim to defendant Neely taxes were paid by said Neely. “ 9. Defendant J. I. Neely paid to Mrs. M. A. Tate the consideration expressed in her deed to him, and had at the time no actual notice of any claim on part of plaintiffs. “ 10. Mrs. M. A. Tate intended the conveyance to J. I. Neely as a quitclaim, and defendant J. I. Neely agreed to receive a quitclaim. “11. Defendants Kramer and Hardt paid to Neely so much of the purchase money as shown by their deeds, and executed negotiable notes for remainder as shown by said deeds.” Conclusions of Law. — “ 1. Mrs. M. A. Tate was invested by the deed from J. C. Brown to herself with the legal title to the land, unvalued, in this litigation, holding same, however, as an undivided seven-eighths of same in trust for plaintiffs herein, who were the equitable owners of said seven-eighths interest. “2. The defendants Oscar Kramer and Herman Hardt having purchased said land from J. I. Neely for a valuable consideration, without notice, actual or constructive, of plaintiffs’ equitable claim to same, and acquired from said Neely the legal title to same, are entitled to judgment quieting their title and possession of same. “ 3. The conveyance by Mrs. M. A. Tate to J. I. Neely being on its face a deed to the land and not a quitclaim to grantor’s interest therein, it passed the legal title vested in M. A. Tate to same; and defendants Kramer and Hardt could not be affected by any private understanding between Mrs. M. A. Tate and J. I. Neely as to the effect of said conveyance, it not being shown that they had any notice, actual or constructive, thereof. “ 4. Plaintiffs not being entitled to recover as against defendants Kramer and Hardt, judgment will be rendered that plaintiffs take nothing by their suit and that defendants recover their costs.” The findings of fact require some explanation, qualifications, and additions, as shown by the evidence. The receiver, J. C. Brown, bought the land at the sale made by him for $87, for Mrs. Tate and her children, and the amount, so reported to the court by the receiver, was ordered, according to the rights of the parties, to be paid to Mrs. Tate and children in equal amounts. The money was never paid. The intention was that Mrs. Tate and her children should own the land equally and jointly. No money was paid Mrs. Tate for the land or to the parties by the receiver, as entitled, but the deed by the receiver was made to Mrs. Tate, the children having by resulting trust seven-eighths of the land, and she one-eighth. Tate bought in a tax title to the land from one Schuchard for $275; the record discloses nothing of the regularity of the tax title but a tax deed by the sheriff of Gillespie County to Schuchard, and a deed from him to Neely, to the admission of which plaintiffs objected, because they did not show a legal assessment of the land for taxes, nor other precedent requisites authorizing the tax sale. (The clerk states that these deeds were missing since the filing of the petition for writ of error, and could not be found in his office.) The sale by Schuchard of his tax title was made over two years from the date of his purchase at the sale. Neely’s purchase from Mrs. Tate was on the 26th day of November, 1884, she at the time living in Yazoo County, Mississippi; he paid her $100 for the entire 1700 acres; he sold the land to Kramer and Hardt, defendants, on the 19th of June, 1886, for $3660 — $536 in cash and $3124 on time, secured by their negotiable promissory notes, the deeds reciting the facts, and retaining a vendor’s lien upon the land sold to each to secure the unpaid balance. This suit was filed February 10, 1887, and at that time, and at the time of the trial, Kramer and Hardt still owed Neely the amount of the notes. It was understood between Mrs. Tate and Neely at the time of her deed to him, that she was to make him a quitclaim deed for her claim to the land, but he had no blank form for quitclaim deed, and used a form of general warranty, inserting after the warranty clause, “ by, through, or under me only,” believing that this language made the deed a quitclaim, as he told Mrs. Tate. The deed purports to convey the land. There was some correspondence between them about the purchase, and two of liis letters to her were in evidence, but the clerk states, in a note, that they are missing and could not be copied. He sent the deed to her to sign. His agreement with her was to buy her claim and take a quitclaim, and he believed he had done so. He knew of no title in the children, or other title, except the tax title which lie owned. The facts leave no doubt that Neel)r contracted for and intended to contract for a quitclaim deed from Mrs. Tate — a quitclaim in its strict legal sense; that is, for her claim onl}-. His deed is in form of a conveyance of the land, it is true, and upon its face is not a quitclaim, but he is not in an attitude to insist upon the form of his deed. He claims to be an innocent purchaser, and contends that he is so becausé his deed purports to convey him the land, and not a mere chance of title: He insists upon the letter of the law in construing the deed, while it is shown by his own testimony that it misrepresents the facts and is false. His letters to Mrs. Tate evidently contained the agreement that he was to have a quitclaim, as he swears he told her he was to buy her title only, he being in Texas and she in Mississippi. It would work a fraud upon her children to refuse to give effect to the agreement. A quitclaim vendee can not be an innocent purchaser, because it serves him with notice that he is only purchasing the chance of title — such title as the vendor has, and no more. Such notice, or any notice of the fact that there is a better title, excludes good faith from the transaction. To be an innocent purchaser the vendee must in good faith pay á valuable consideration, without notice of outstanding legal or equitable rights. His agreement to take a strict quitclaim has the effect to give him notice. 1-Iis deed should be construed upon this question by all the facts attending the transaction — his letters, his actual information, his agreement for a quitclaim, the gross' inadequacy of consideration, and any other circumstance tending to show notice and the absence of good faith. He testifies, that he was to have only Mrs. Tate’s title, that he thought or believed the deed was a quitclaim, and that the special warranty made it so. Under such circumstances he should not be allowed to take advantage of the form of the deed to establish good faith. He was himself responsible for the mistake in the deed; he knew what a quitclaim implied— title of the vendor only; he was in the position of one who had all the notice a quitclaim could give, with a full understanding of what such title meant — notice, and want of good faith. He asks to be protected upon equitable principles. These principles do not apply in his case. He is not what he claims to be — an innocent purchaser. He should not by force of legal rules of construction (of his deed) be allowed equitable protection when the undisputed facts show that he is not within the equity rule invoked. Delivered November 2, 1892. We are of opinion that he had full notice of the character of title he was receiving, qualified and controlled as it was by the attending circumstances. Under such title he could not be a purchaser in good faith. Harrison v. Boring, 44 Texas, 262; Taylor v. Harrison, 47 Texas, 461; Milam County v. Bateman, 54 Texas, 155; Richardson v. Levi, 67 Texas, 359; 2 Pome. Eq. Jur., sec. 753. Finding that Neely is in the same attitude of a vendee in a quitclaim, he is required to take notice of all other claims to the land. He can not say he knew of one, the tax title bought in by himself, and therefore did not know of the equitable title in the plaintiffs. His position is that of one having notice of all titles. The question is not one of being merely put upon inquiry; the notice is absolute and conclusive as to all claims. It was in proof that the greater part of the purchase price of the land had not been paid to Neely by Kramer and Hardt, to whom he had contracted a sale of the land for $3660. It seems the notes are negotiable promissory notes, but at the time of trial they were still owned and held by Neely. They are not irrevocably bound to pay him these notes, and if they should do so after notice of plaintiffs’ rights, they would not be acquitted of their obligation to pay the true owners at least the amount unpaid at the time of notice. To this extent they would not be innocent purchasers. Plaintiffs’ pleadings prayed for relief appropriate to the case, judgment against them (Kramer and Hardt) for the unpaid purchase money, but the court below refused it. 2 Pome. Eq. Jur., secs. 754, 755, 756; 1 Story Eq. Jur., sec. 64; Perry on Trusts, secs. 219, 221; Caldwell v. Fraim, 32 Texas, 310; Evans v. Templeton, 69 Texas, 375. The judgment of the lower court should be reversed and remanded, and it is so ordered. jReversed and remanded.","Robert Tate et al. v. Oscar Kramer et al. No. 24. 1. Quitclaim — Bona Fide Purchaser. — A quitclaim vendee can not be an innocent purchaser, because his deed serves him with notice that he is only purchasing the chance of title — such title as the vendor had, and no more. Such notice, or any notice of the fact that there is a better title, excludes good faith from the transaction. 2. Same — Circumstances of Execution of Deed. — The vendee, in correspondence with his vendor, agreed to take a quitclaim. He prepared a deed with special warranty, thinking it to be a quitclaim. It was signed. In subsequent litigation, the vendee asserting title as a bona fide purchaser against equitable owners of the greater part of the land, upon the issue whether the deed was a quitclaim, held, that it should be construed by the facts attending the transaction — his letters to his vendor, his actual information, his agreement for a quitclaim, the inadequacy in price, etc. 3. Mistake. — The vendee knowing the facts, and agreeing to take a quitclaim, but by mistake taking a deed with special warranty “by, through, or under” the vendor, can not claim the benefit of his own mistake, and be exempt from notice imparted by the quitclaim. 4. Unpaid Purchase Money — Warranty.—In an action of trespass to try title against parties in possession under warranty deeds executed to them by one affected with notice of a superior equity, the warrantor was made party by the defendants. It appeared that the defendants had paid but a part of the purchase money, and had executed their negotiable notes for the remainder. It appeared that their warrantor still held these notes. The defendants being innocent purchasers recovered the land, and the plaintiffs showing title against their vendor were entitled to recover of the defendants the unpaid purchase money. They would be liable also upon their payment of the notes after notice of the superior title in the plaintiffs. Error from Gillespie. Tried below before Hon. A. W. Moursund. Statement is given in opinion. Brown & Dunn, for plaintiffs in error. Upon the facts proved and found at the trial below, neither Neely nor his vendees, Kramer and Hardt, are bona fide innocent purchasers of the land in controversy for valuable considerations, without notice of the claims and rights of plaintiffs to said land, within the meaning of the equitable rule which protects such purchasers of the legal title against the claims of the equitable owners; and the judgment below should have been for the plaintiffs for seven-eighths of the land sued for, or seven-eighths of the purchase money yet due and owing to Neely, or at least for so much of the purchase money as was due and owing to Neely, not to exceed seven-eighths of the value of the land.

A. Tate to J. I. Neely was an absolute conveyance of the land, and his attitude is that of an innocent purchaser without notice, unaffected by any latent equity, founded on trust, fraud, or otherwise. 2. Where the owner of land makes a conveyance absolute in form, with a parol trust annexed, a subsequent purchaser from the donee of such trust would not be affected by it, nor is he affected by the fraud of his vendor. 50 Texas, 379; 6 Texas, 489; 53 Texas, 242. 3. Though a purchaser has certain information of some defect in the title to real estate which he proposes to buy, if he pursues a proper inquiry into the truth of such information and ascertains facts which would satisfy a prudent man that such vice or defect does not in fact exist, he will be a purchaser in good faith. Now, in this case grant that the conveyance from Mrs. M. A. Tate to J. I. Neely was of a nature to put Neely on inquiry as to the validity of the title of his vendor, Mrs. M. A. Tate, and if he pursued a proper inquiry into the truth of such information as would have ascertained facts which would satisfy a prudent man that no defects in her title existed, he (Neely) would be a purchaser in good faith, and would not be affected by any parol trust that he had no actual or constructive notice. 9 Texas, 363. 4. Defendant J. I. Neely would not be affected in his title to the land in controversy by any parol contemporaneous understanding between J. C. Brown, receiver of the Tate estate, and Mrs. M. A. Tate, prior to and at the time of the execution of the deed by the said Brown to Mrs. M. A. Tate, that it was to be a deed in trust for the benefit of the plaintiffs in error herein, unless he was actually informed that such was the purpose of the conveyance. 5. Parol testimony is admissible to prove that a deed or instrument, absolute on its face, was executed and delivered on certain trusts not reduced to writing, and which the grantee promised to perform; but this rule would not apply to a third party who is a purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice, either actual or constructive, as to the existence of such trust. 10 Texas, 159; 27 Texas, 231; 24 Texas, 426; 44 Texas, 445; 44 Texas, 275; 47 Texas, 43; 51 Texas, 257."
"KEY, Associate Justice. This suit was brought by August Garteiser,. against the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company, to-recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him through the alleged negligence of defendant, its agents and employes, on the 25th day of March, 1887, while plaintiff was in the act of crossing a bridge on a hand car on the line of defendant’s railway. Among other matters, the defendant’s answer contained a general denial and a plea of contributory negligence. The specific charges of negligence in the plaintiff’s petition, are: 1. Failure to ring the bell or blow the whistle upon the part of defendant’s employes when the train which occasioned the accident in question approached and crossed a certain public road near the bridge. 2. The excessive rate of speed at which the train was running at the time. A verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of the defendant, and plaintiff has appealed. The assignments of error are numerous, and complain of nearly every paragraph of the court’s charge, and of its refusal to give certain special instructions asked by plaintiff. At the time in question, the Southern Pacific Railway Company had possession of and was operating appellee’s railway, and one Heinemann had a contract with saifl company to fence the right of way of the railway. Appellant and five other men were employed by Heinemann to assist him, and together they constituted what was called “the fence gang.” They were furnished by the company with a hand car to transport themselves and tools from place to place on the road, as their work required. This car was furnished to Heinemann under his contract with the company. Appellant had no contract with the company. There is some conflict in the testimony as to the particular instructions Heinemann had received from the representative of the company who employed him, as to the care he should observe in crossing bridges, passing curves, etc. On the morning of March 25, 1887, Heinemann and his fence gang started on the hand car from Seguin to the place of their work, over two miles east of Seguin. To reach their destination they had to pass over the Gerónimo bridge, on appellee’s railway. The weather was foggy, and when they got about half across the bridge they saw a freight train approaching and about to cross the bridge from the opposite direction. The threatened collision between the train and the hand car was not known by those operating either in time to avert it. The collision occurred ; the men on the hand car jumped off, and appellant fell through the bridge and was injured. The train was going west and the hand car east. There was a public road crossing the railway not far east of the bridge, and the railway track made a curve near the bridge, on the east side of the stream. There is conflict in the testimony as to the rate of speed at which the train was moving, and as to signals (whistle and bell) at the road crossing, and between there and the bridge. The train was an extra, not running on schedule time. Appellant testified, that he was acquainted with the road where the accident curred; knew that the railway ran across the public road east of and near the bridge; that when he and his associates reached the bridge, they stopped and listened for trains and could hear none. The first, second, and third paragraphs of the charge contain only a statement of the issues in the case and an introduction to the succeeding paragraphs. Paragraphs 10 and 11 are abstract propositions, and do not bear on any special fact in this case. Paragraphs 14 and 15 relate to statutory signals at road crossings, and therein the jury are told that said signals are solely for the benefit and protection of parties on the road crossing, and that a failure to give said signals would not be negligence so far as plaintiff was concerned; and that it would be sufficient if the whistle was blown before reaching the crossing. In the fourth, seventh, eighth, and twelfth paragraphs the jury are told, in substance, that the railway company has the right to make rules to regulate the running of trains and hand cars on its railway; that all persons using hand cars are bound to know, of and to obey these rules. That any notice of such rules given to Heinemann was notice to plaintiff; and that if the company had rules requiring flagmen to be sent out ahead of hand cars in foggy weather, then if the jury believe the weather was foggy at the time of the accident, and no flagman was sent out in advance of the hand car, and that the failure to so flag the train caused the collision, then plaintiff could not recover. That if the rules of the railway company did not require signals by bell or whistle to be given by the train which collided with the hand car, on account of fogs, or on approaching bridges, etc., and that if said rules only required such signals to be given when approaching road crossings, or when in dangerous proximity to obstructions upon it road track, and such obstructions are discovered by some of the employes in charge of the train, then it was not negligence on the part of the employes not to have blown the whistle of said train after passing the first public road crossing east of the bridge. And the fourth paragraph, in effect, told the jury that appellant was chargeable with the contributory negligence of Heinemann, if the latter was guilty of any. In paragraphs 5,6, and 9 the jury are told that a railway company has the right to run extra or special trains on its roads whenever it deems it proper to do so, and that all persons rightfully on the track are chargeable with notice of this fact. That a person rightfully on the track can only expect from the company such care and consideration as it owes to the general public, and has no right to expect anything more, and is bound to use the highest degree of care to protect himself from accidents. The fifth, sixth, and ninth paragraphs of the charge required appellant to exercise a degree of care greater than that imposed upon him by law. He was not a trespasser, nor was he on the railway track by mere courtesy or permission. A fair construction of the testimony shows that Heinemann and his employes, under his contract with the company, had a legal right to the use of the track in the manner they were using it. Of course this right was subordinate to the company’s right to run its trains on the track; and whenever it became necessary for one to yield its use to the other, the right of the company was superior. Under these circumstances, it was not proper to instruct the jury that appellant was required to exercise “the highest degree of care.” While expressions in text books and decisions may be found stating as a fact that persons on the track of a railway are requirad to use the highest degree of care to protect themselves, still, without qualification, it is not in a case of this character an accurate statement of the law, and should not, under the rules that prevail in this State, be given as a charge to a jury. All that the law required of appellant on the occasion in question, was the exercise of such care for his own safety as ordinarily prudent persons would have exercised under like circumstances; and the court could not legitimately tell the jury that such care was “the highest degree of care.” Railway v. Dyer, 76 Texas, 156; Railway v. Garcia, 75 Texas, 583; Railway v. Brin, 77 Texas, 174; Artusy v. Railway, 73 Texas, 191. Although in Brown v. Griffin, 71 Texas, 654, a charge is approved which appears to encroach upon it, the rule obtains in this State, that in the absence of a statute or other express provision of law declaring a particular act or omission unlawful, the court can not properly instruct the jury that such act or omission constitutes negligence. Railway v. Murphy, 46 Texas, 356; Railway v. Chapman, 57 Texas, 82; Railway v. Lee, 70 Texas, 496; Railway v. Hill, 71 Texas, 451; Campbell v. Trimble, 75 Texas, 270; Railway v. Anderson, 76 Texas, 244; Calhoun v. Railway, 84 Texas, 226. The fourth, seventh, eighth, and twelfth paragraphs of the charge contravened this rule. As regards rules and regulations by the company for the government of hand cars on its road, it was not permissible for the court to do more than tell the jury, that if there was proof of such rules or regulations, and it was shown that appellant knew, or by the use of ordinary diligence might have known, of such rules or regulations, then that fact might be considered by the jury in determining whether or not he had been guilty of contributory negligence. Railway v. Lamothe, 76 Texas, 220. That portion of the charge which instructed the jury, that the statutory signals required to be given by railway trains when they approach and cross public roads or streets were for the sole benefit of-persons travelling such roads and streets, and that a failure to give them would not be negligence as to persons travelling on the railroad track, was incorrect. It was held in Railway v. Gray, 65 Texas, 32, that while the primary object of the statute was the protection of persons using the public roads and streets, that as to persons rightfully travelling in hand cars on railway tracks, whether or not a failure to give such signals would constitute negligence must be determined by the jury. Appellant asked a charge embodying the doctrine announced in that case, and the refusal of the court to give it was error. The fifteenth paragraph of the charge was inaccurate in not stating the distance from the crossing that the signals are to be given; and the latter part of it, telling the jury that if the whistle was blown the failure to ring the bell would not be negligence, was violative of the rule already referred to, denying the right of the court to tell the jury that any given .state of facts will or will not constitute negligence. The court also erred in charging that notice of the company’s rules to Heinemann would be notice to appellant. If the former had been the agent of the latter, the charge might have been correct. But the evidence shows the reverse. Heinemann was the master and appellant his servant. For a like reason, the court was wrong in charging that co-operative negligence on the part of Heinemann would be imputed to appellant, and preclude his right of recovery, if otherwise any existed. Under the English rule, as declared in Thorogood v. Bryan, 8 Common Bench, 115, this holding would be correct; but the American doctrine, as settled by the great weight of authority, is, that the negligence of another person, not participated in by the plaintiff, will not be attributed to him unless he has some right of control over such person, or they are, on terms of equality, engaged in a joint enterprise. In some States there are exceptions to this rule, when suits are brought for persons non sui juris, and contributory negligence of parents, guardians, etc., is interposed as a defense. In support of the general rule, the following authorities are referred to: Beach on Con. Neg., beginning on page 103; 4 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 82, and cases there cited; Little v. Hackett, 116 U. S., 366; Railway v. Kutac, 72 Texas, 643; Markham v. Navigation Co., 73 Texas, 247. The general objection to the charge, that it gave undue prominence to appellee’s side of the case and minimized appellant’s, thereby indicating to the jury that in the opinion of the court appellant was not entitled to recover, is to some extent true. This results, however, from the court’s-misapprehension of the law applicable to the case, and not through any design to improperly influence the jury. Besides, it is to some extent, cured by the special charge asked by appellant and given, which presented the appellant’s theory of the case affirmatively to the jury. For the errors pointed out in the charge of the court, the judgment is reversed and cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 18, 1893.","August Garteiser v. Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company. No. 60. 1. Degree of Care—Using Hand Car.—A contractor to fence the right of way was authorized to use a hand car in transporting his employes to and from their labor. In going to labor the hand car collided with an occasional train, and in the collision the plaintiff, one of the fence gang, was injured. In a suit for damages by him against the railway company it was not proper to instruct the jury that the plaintiff was required to exercise “ the highest degree of care.” The plaintiff was not a trespasser, nor was he on the track by mere courtesy or permission. Ordinary care was all that was imposed upon him under the.circumstances. 2. Charge — Negligence. — The rule obtains in this State, that in the absence of a statute or other express provision of law declaring a particular act or omission unlawful, the court can not properly instruct the jury that such act or omission constitutes negligence. 3. Rules by Railway Company for Use of Hand Cars.—In an action for damages for personal injuries suffered by plaintiff, who in his employment was rightfully upon a hand car which collided with a train, in which collision plaintiff was injured, the trial court should only instruct the jury that they should consider such rules, etc., if known to plaintiff, upon the issue of contributory negligence. 4. Signals at Crossings, etc. — The failure to give such signals may be considered in determining the question of due care on part of the railway company, in behalf of a plaintiff injured in a collision with an approaching train while lawfully upon a hand car belonging to the defendant. 5. Notice to Master not Notice to Servant.—A contractor to fence the right of way had work hands in liis employ. Held, that notice to the master was not chargeable upon his servants, of the rules and regulations touching the use of hand cars by such employes. 6. Co-operative Negligence.—The negligence of another person not participated in by the plaintiff will not be attributed to him, unless he has some right of control over such person, or they are on terms of equality, engaged in a joint enterprise. Appeal from Bexar. Tried below before Hon. G. H. Noonan. W. W. Boone and C. L. Wurzbach, for appellant. 1. When a person is rightfully on the track of a railway company, and is there not only by the permission, but at the instance and by the invitation of the company, and at a place designated by the company, then the company owes such person a higher duty than it owes to the public generally; and such person is not bound to use the highest degree of care to shield himself from injury, but is only bound to use such reasonable care as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances.

The rules and regulations of a railway company being purely arbitrary, or in other words, a railway company having the arbitrary power to make, unmake, change, or alter its rules and regulations at pleasure, there is no legal presumption that such rules and regulations are known to any one outside of the railway company or its officials; and this is undoubtedly true as to one who has no direct connection or privity with the company, and a charge to the contrary is a charge on the weight of the evidence. Wood’s Mast. and Serv., 776, 777; Fay v. Railway, 11 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, 193; Sprong v. Railway, 58 N. Y., 56; Railway v. Perry, 6 So. Rep., 40.

Railway, 70 Texas, 114; Railway v. Porfert, 72 Texas, 349. 3. Negligence is generally a question of fact and not of law; and being a question of fact, it is not proper for the court to charge the jury, as-matter of law, what facts do or do not constitute negligence, as such a charge is a charge on the weight of the evidence; but the jury should be allowed to consider the question of negligence in connection with all the other surrounding facts and circumstances of the case. Railway v. Murphy, 46 Texas, 366; Heldt v. Webster, 60 Texas, 209; Hays v. Railway, 70 Texas, 608; Costley v. Railway, 70 Texas, 114; Railway v. Porfert, 72 Texas, 349. 4. A charge which repeatedly calls the attention of the jury to defendant’s evidence, thereby giving the same undue prominence, and which fails to give due prominence to plaintiff’s evidence, is improper, and is,, in effect, a charge on the weight of the evidence.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Appellees brought this suit as plaintiffs in the court below, to recover of appellants a balance of $614.13, with interest at 8 per cent per annum, alleged to be due them upon an open account. Appellants answered, in effect, that they took a contract to do certain railway grading for appellees, and that appellees agreed to advance tools, money, supplies, etc., to them during the prosecution of the work, and after the principal part of the work had been completed, appellees refused to comply with their part of the contract, and appellants, being unable to complete the same without such assistance, were by such refusal caused damage in a considerable sum. The accounts between the parties being voluminous, an auditor was appointed by the court, who filed his report, showing a balance due appellants of $93.90. After moving to strike out the report of the auditor, which was overruled by the court, appellees filed exceptions to the different items complained of by them in the report, and the whole case was submitted under the charge of the court to the jury, who found a verdict in favor of appellees for $235.27, and from the judgment rendered thereon this appeal is prosecuted. No statement of facts accompanies the record. Appellants, under their first assignment of error, present the proposition that “ after a motion to set aside an auditor’s report has been overruled, such report is conclusive of all matters upon which it shows that the auditor admitted and heard evidence, and thereupon reported his conclusions, unless it appears that the auditor’s acts were irregular as to some item or items, and then only such items are subject to further proof.” After the court had overruled their motion to exclude the auditor’s report altogether, appellees, with great particularity, filed their exceptions to different items in the report, and we are of opinion that the practice adopted was in all things in compliance with our statute and decisions, and that appellees did all that they were required to do to secure a trial by jury upon the disputed items in their account. In authorizing the appointment of an auditor in oases involving complicated accounts, it was not the intention of the Legislature to deprive the parties of the right to secure a jury trial upon the disputed items; but as said in Kempner v. Galveston County, 76 Texas, 457, quoting from Dwyer v. Kalteyer, 68 Texas, 554, “ The purpose of the appointment of an auditor is to have an account so made up that the undisputed items upon either side may be eliminated from the contest and the issue thereby narrowed to the points actually in dispute. The items of an account in an auditor’s report not excepted to by either party are conclusive, but as to such as are excepted to the report is without effect.” In Richie v. Levy, 69 Texas, 138, the practice and effect of appointing an auditor under our statute is also reviewed at length. We are therefore of the opinion that an auditor’s report is only conclusive as to the items not excepted to, and that the court did not err in submitting thé contested items to the decision of the jury. Upon the trial appellees were permitted to introduce in evidence their books of account, to which appellants objected, on tlie ground .that no sufficient predicate for their introduction had been laid. In Baldridge v. Penland, 68 Texas, 443, the admissibility of such books is very fully considered, and in that case, in order to make them admissible, it is said: “ 1. It must be shown that tlie books offered contained the daily record of the business of the person for whom they are kept as it transpires from day to day between himself and customers, and that the entries therein are original entries, made contemporaneously with the transaction of the business which the entries are intended to evidence. 2. The entries must relate to the business carried on by the person for whom the books are kept, and not to matters in no way connected with that business. 3. The entries must be sufficient to show with reasonable certainty what thing is made the basis of the charge., 4. The book must be on its face regular, and the entries free from suspicion or alteration. 5. The person offering such books, if they be kept by himself, must ordinarily, if living, make oath to tlieir correctness; and we think further, that he should be held to make proof tending to show his probity and fair dealing; as that the accounts of other persons kept in the same manner are usually found correct, or so treated by his customers.” To the same effect is Underwood v. Parrott, 2 Texas, 168. The bill of exceptions incorporated in the record hardly shows a sufficient compliance by appellees with the requirements of the law to make their books admissible. We are. unable to see from their bill of exceptions that the books offered were the books of original entries, or that the entries therein were made contemporaneously with the transaction, or that the books appeared fair and regular upon their face. But we are of opinion that it would not be proper for us to treat this bill of exceptions as containing a full account of all the evidence introduced in the case, which could have been considered in connection,with these books, and that in the absence of a statement of facts from which we could tell with certainty that the appellants had been injured by this action of the court, we would not be authorized to reverse the cause. Lockett v. Schurenberg, 60 Texas, 610. In fact, this bill of exceptions shows that one Merriweather, who assisted in keeping these books, was present at the trial, and, so far as we can tell from the record, he may have fully proven up this account without reference to the books, so as to make the evidence complained of immaterial. The case in 60 Texas, cited above, will be found to contain a full review of the authorities illustrating the practice of the Supreme Court in this State where no statement of facts accompanies the record and an error is assigned to the admission or exclusion of evidence. Delivered November 15, 1892. The contract between appellants and appellees for doing work upon the railroad was in writing, but nothing was said therein as to the agreement on the part of appellees to furnish appellants with supplies, etc., as alleged in their answer. It is not pretended but that this part of the contract was entered into contemporaneously with the written one and was a part of the same agreement, and no allegations of fraud, accident, or mistake are made to explain why it ivas not incorporated in the writing. Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the court did not err in refusing to admit evidence as to such contemporaneous verbal contract. See Rubrecht v. Powers, decided by this court at its present term, and authorities therein cited. In the absence of a statement of facts we are unable to see that there was any error in the action of the court in excluding the evidence offered by appellants as to the relative, cost of the different parts of the work they had undertaken to do. We believe that before a court should feel authorized to reverse a case for alleged error in the admission or exclusion of evidence, it should be furnished with a full statement of the facts proven on the trial; or at least the bill of exceptions should show with certainty the materiality of the evidence when considered in connection with all that had been proven upon the trial. It would certainly be a dangerous practice for appellate courts to undertake to act upon abstract questions of this kind without being furnished with sufficient data in the record to enable it to decide upon the importance of the question in reference to the whole case. We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed. Affirmed.","Bupp & Robbins v. J. F. O’Connor & Co. No. 30. 1. Evidence — Auditor’s Report. — An auditor’s report is conclusive only as to the items not excepted to. It eliminates from the contest the undisputed items on either side, and narrows the issue to the point actually in dispute. 2. Evidence — Books of Account. — Before books of account are admissible in evidence, it must be shown that they contain the daily record of the business of the person for whom they are kept, as it transpires from day to day between himself and customers, and that the entries therein are original entries, made contemporaneously with the transaction of the business which they are intended to evidence. 3. Practice on Appeal — Statement of Facts. — Where error is assigned as to the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellate court should be furnished with a full statement of the facts proven on the trial, or at least the bill of exceptions should show with certainty the materiality of the evidence when considered in connection with all that has been proved upon the trial. 4. Parol Evidence to Vary Writing. — Where there is a written contract. parol evidence of a contemporaneous matter appearing to be part of the same agreement is not admissible in the absence of an allegation of fraud, accident, or mistake.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This is a second suit of trespass to try title, brought by the appellant against C. P. Bennett and J. R. Bennett, for six acres of land, alleged in the petition to be a part of the Samuel Johnson survey, in McLennan County. The defendants pleaded not guilty. There was a valid grant of eleven leagues of land, including the six acres sued for, made to Miguel Rabago, September 24, January —, 1834. Plaintiff claimed the land by valid conveyances from the only heirs of Rabago, who died in 1848. Rabago, on May 25, 1836, by attorney in fact, conveyed the eleven leagues to Guillermo Laguerenne, who was then residing in the City of Mexico, an alien to Texas. Defendants set up this conveyance as an outstanding title; and it is admitted that if by it Laguerenne acquired title, plaintiff has no title and can not recover. Defendants also set up title under patent to Samuel Johnson, a junior title to the Rabago. The court below gave judgment for the defendants, on the ground that the deed to Laguerenne conveyed the Rabago grant to him, and that therefore plaintiff could not recover. Plaintiff appealed, and filed transcript in Supreme Court March 31, 1890. The parties have made an agreed case, under rule 59, clause 2, of the Supreme Court, as follows: “In compliance with clause 2 of. rule 59, Supreme Court, it is agreed that there is no controversy as to the facts in this cause. “The issues presented are of law, and are clearly stated in the assignment of errors, and are briefly herein set out. “1. D. H. Williams, vendor of appellant, brought this action of trespass to try title to the land in controversy on September 11, 1873, which action was finally decided against him December term, 1888. “Thereafter the said D. H. Williams conveyed the land in controversy to Eugene Williams, appellant, on March 26, 1889, who on April 1,1889, brought this second action of trespass to try title. The defendants plead not guilty and the statutes of limitations, but do not plead res ad judicata. “ The court below concluded as matter of law, that whilst the first action of D. H. Williams suspended the statute of limitation, the judgment in that action against D. H. Williams is res ad judicata as to his vendee, Eugene Williams, appellant, on the ground that a plaintiff is entitled to a second action of trespass to try title under the law prior to the Revised Statutes of 1879, if his action was brought prior to 1879, but his vendee, the appellant herein, is not entitled to a second action, but is barred by the first adjudication. “ The appellant'assigns as error this conclusion of the court as applied to the record in this case; because, first, the defendants do not plead res adjudicata; and second, this conclusion is not the law, since appellant is also entitled to a second action, being the vendee of the plaintiff in the first action. “ 2. It is admitted that appellant’s title is good from Miguel Rabago, the original grantee, through his only heir, Rosa Musquiz Rabago, who, joined by her husband, Antonio Cortez, conveyed the land to appellant’s vendor, unless the deed from Rabago, by Blanco, to Guillermo Laguerenne, of date City of Mexico, May 25, 1836, is valid. “If this deed passed the title to Laguerenne, subject to be defeated by any action of the government, the appellant’s title can not be sustained. “As stated above, unless this deed is an absolute nullity, appellant has no title. “Appellant claims it is void. If void, the judgment should be reversed and rendered for appellant. “ Laguerenne was a resident citizen of the City of Mexico and a nonresident alien to Texas on May 25, 1836, when this deed was executed and delivered to him in the City of Mexico. “ Being a nonresident alien, appellant claims he could neither acquire nor hold title to land, and the sale to him was a nullity and the deed void. “ The court below concluded that the civil law rule of law was, that a sale to a nonresident alien was a nullity, but this rule did not ‘ apply to the condition of the young Republic,’ and that this deed was valid and passed the title. Appellant assigns as error, the conclusions: first, that a deed to a nonresident alien passed title and was valid on May 25, 1836, whereas such sale was a nullity; second, that the civil law was not applicable to the : condition of the new Republic’ on May 25, 1836; third, that the court confined his conclusion of law to the civil law, finding the civil law rule that such sale was a nullity, but that it did not apply to the new Republic, whereas there were special enactments of Mexico and Texas (declaring this to be the law of the young Republic), of which the court below took no notice in his conclusions, yet which, together with the civil law, was the law governing this question on May 25, 1836. “ The appellee contends that the sale to Laguerenne was not a nullity, but that, as at common law, a defeasible title passed to him, subject to forfeiture to the State upon inquest of office or like proceeding, which never having been done, leaves the title in Laguerenne’s vendee as an outstanding title. “ It is agreed the foregoing is a clear and succinct statement of the points of law involved in this record.” The foregoing agreement and statement of the case is duly signed by the attorneys for the parties. The first assignment of error by appellant, that the court erred in holding that the vendee of one entitled to bring a second suit in trespass to try title under the law could not maintain the action, in our opinion, ought to be sustained. The right of D. H. Williams to bring his second suit was an assignable right, and passed to his vendee. The remaining questions in the case are presented by assignment, as follows: The appellant assigns as error: “ 2. The finding and judgment of the court that Rabago’s deed to Laguerenne passed title to the latter, whereas Laguerenne was a nonresident alien to Texas, and could neither acquire nor .hold land in Texas, and the sale and deed to him were nullities. ‘13. The finding of the court that the well known doctrine of the civil law (admitted by the court to be that a nonresident alien could neither take nor hold title to land) was not applicable to the condition of the young Republic on May 25, 1836. “ 4. The failure of the court to pass upon this question of the sale to Laguerenne, as being also governed by the laws of Mexico and Texas, declaring the doctrine of the civil law that such sale was a nullity, and in confining the conclusion of law and basing the judgment of the court alone upon the conclusion that the doctrine of the civil law was not applicable to the conditions of the young Republic.” By the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, adopted March 17, 1836 (prior to the Laguerenne deed), article 6, schedule, section 1, laws then in force, were continued, as follows: “That no inconvenience may arise from the adoption of this Constitution, it is declared by this convention, that all laws now in force in Texas, and not inconsistent with this Constitution, shall remain in full force until declared void, repealed, altered, or expire by their own limitation.” Pasch. Dig., 35. It was also provided in the same Constitution: “ No alien shall hold land in Texas except by titles emanating directly from the government. of this Republic.” But alien heirs could inherit estate, and were allowed .a reasonable time' in which to take possession and dispose of the same. What the laws were at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, and while the foregoing provisions were in force, and especially the meaning of the first provision quoted, has been the subject of much learned discussion in the courts, and of conflicting decisions. The opinion of Chief Justice Hemphill, as expressed in Holliman v. Peebles, 1 Texas, 674, evidently was, that an alien could not acquire land in the Republic of Mexico after the decree of the 12th of March, 1828. He says: “ But whatever maybe the true construction of the laws of Spain or of colonization on the subject matter, there can be no doubt that the capacity of aliens to hold lands in the Republic of Mexico, if it ever existed under the laws of Spain, was extinguished by the decree of the 12th of March, 1828. Ordines y Decretos, vol. 4, p. 155. The sixth article of this decree is expressed in the following terms, viz.: ‘ Foreigners introduced and established in conformity with the regulations prescribed, or which shall hereafter be prescribed, are under the protection of the laws, and enjoy the civil rights conferred by these upon Mexicans, with the exception of acquiring landed rural property, which by existing laws those not naturalized can not obtain.’ The acquisition of real property is not only prohibited, but it is also declared that by the laws then in force it could not be acquired without naturalization. * * * The provisions of this decree are peculiarly stern against the acquisition of lands by foreigners, and subjects, in its eleventh article, all such lands acquired in fraud of the law to denunciation by any Mexican, to whom they shall be adjudged on proof of fraud.” Holliman v. Peebles, T Texas, 719. The question before the court in the above case was one of alienage of the plaintiffs, upon a plea of alienage set up by defendants, to which the civil law was applied, and the conclusion reached that the plea of alien-age was properly sustained. But it should be noted that that suit was brought in December, 1840, after the common law was adopted in the Republic of Texas. In Barrett v. Kelly, 31 Texas, 481, it is, in effect, decided, that aliens could acquire land in Texas, subject to be divested according to the laws of Mexico. In Clay v. Clay, 26 Texas, 31, 32, the question was, could a nonresident alien acquire by purchase land in Coahuila and Texas, or in Mexico, by deed executed in 1830, recognized and approved by the vendor up to the time of his death, in 1835 ? The conclusion of the court was that he could not. The reasoning of Chief Justice Hemphill, in Holliman v. Peebles, was approved, and the court said: “ We can not err in holding that under the laws of Mexico an alien was incapable of holding real estate.” The court quotes from Escriche a law of the Republic of Mexico, of December, 1835, providing that “the foreigner or alien can not acquire real property in the Republic, unless, having been naturalized, he shall marry a Mexican, and observe moreover that which the law prescribes relative to these acquisitions.” Escriche, word Extranjero, 668. And also cites the sixth article of the decree of March 12, 1828, and construes both laws as prohibiting aliens from acquiring real estate in Texas at the date of the deed mentioned. This holding was approved in Lacoste v. Odam, 26 Texas, 458. In Osterman v. Baldwin, 6 Wallace, 116, the Supreme Court of the United States held, that a deed to a citizen in New York to land inTexas, in 1839, conveyed a good title, subject to be defeated only by office found. But if this were not so, it is said, while Texas was a separate Republic, after it was admitted into the Union, the status of the vendee was changed as by naturalization, which had a retroactive effect so as to confirm the title. The Supreme Court of this State, in Andrews v. Spear, 48 Texas, 567, in construing General Provisions, section 10, of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, prescribing that “no alien shall hold land in Texas except by titles emanating directly from the government of the Republic,” adhered to the holding in Osterman v. Baldwin, that a deed to an alien was only voidable, and would protect him until some proceeding on the part of the Republic against him. The deed was executed in 1841. The same doctrine was held by our present Supreme Court in the case of Baker v. Westcott, 73 Texas, 134, where the deed was also executed to the alien in 1841. The court say, that the provision of the Constitution of 1836, General Provisions, section 10, was construed in both the cases above cited, Osterman v. Baldwin and Andrews v. Spear, in which “ it was held, in effect, that a conveyance to an alien during the days of the Republic was subject to be escheated by a proceeding in the nature of office found, at the instance of the government, but that as between the parties to it and their privies it was good.” The court then concludes, “ that under the conveyance, Westcott, the alien, took a title subject to be escheated at the will of the Republic, and that upon annexation his title became indefeasible.” The deeds in both of the foregoing Texas cases were made in 1841, after the common law was adopted, which was, on this subject, that an alien could take and hold land by purchase, subject to office found, but could not inherit it or take by implication of law that which the law would escheat on proceeding for that purpose. The Constitution was paramount, however, and could not be controlled by the common law in case of conflict, and we do not suppose it was allowed to do so iii these cases. It is contended, that the laws of Mexico prohibited an alien from acquiring or holding land, and that by article 6, schedule, section 1, of the Constitution, these laws were adopted as then understood and administered, until repealed. This was the effect of the provision, in so far as such laws were not inconsistent with that Constitution nor with public policy. It was not the intention to destroy titles that had matured. McMullen v. Hodge, 5 Texas, 35. But the question still is, What was the law of Mexico, and of Coahuila and Texas ? And how was that law affected by the alien clause in the Constitution ? The latest decisions of the Supreme Court of this State, above cited, have given us a construction, and declared that an alien, in so far as such law applied to the condition of things in the Republic, could hold real estate and could have good title until it was divested by the government. Our court is not alone in this construction of the civil law, or of that law as engrafted upon the laws of the Republic of Texas, to 1840. In the case of Hammekin v. Clayton, 2 Woods, 337, a deed of the 11th of April, 1836, to an alien, was under consideration, and the court, after reviewing the authorities, and especially the tenth general provision of the Constitution of 1836, decided that the deed was not void, and that the better view of the decision of the courts was, that under the Mexican law a deed to an alien vested title, subject to be divested by proceedings by the government for that purpose. The conflict in Holliman v. Peebles, Clay v. Clay, Lacoste v. Odam, with Barrett v. Kelly and Settegast v. Schrimpf (35 Texas, 341), was discussed. In Phillips v. Moore, 100 United States, 208, the question was whether an alien could take title under a deed to land in Texas, executed in May, 1828. It was held that he could — a defeasible title — subject to the right of the government to have it vacated by some proceeding ascertaining the fact. Here the Texas cases up to Barrett v. Kelly were reviewed, the court holding with that case, and with De Merle v. Mathews, a California case. 26 Cal., 456. The court say that ‘ ‘ this conclusion is strengthened by the act of the Mexican Congress of the 12th of March, 1828, in relation to passports and the mode of acquiring property by foreigners.” The court refers to the sixth article of the decree, upon which so much stress is laid by Chief Justice Hemphill in the Holliman case, and continues as follows: ‘ ‘ But yet, the eleventh article of the same act declares that property acquired by unnaturalized foreigners in fraud of the law may be denounced by any Mexican, to whom it will be adjudged as soon as such fraud is proved. It would thus seem that, notwithstanding the prohibitory language of the sixth article, title may pass to a foreigner not naturalized, though it be one which is defeasible upon the denunciation of a private citizen. ’ ’ The fact that proof of fraud in the manner of acquiring was required to enable a private citizen to denounce, is an indication that land sold to an alien did not ipso facto escheat, or return to the public domain. This is the view taken of the Act of 1828 by the Supreme Court of California, in the case of De Merle v. Mathews, 26 California, 477. “A denouncement,’’ says the court, “was a judicial proceeding, and though real property might be acquired by an alien in fraud of the law — that is, without observing its requirements — he nevertheless retained his right and title to it, liable to be deprived of it by proper proceedings of denouncement, which, in its substantive characteristics, was equivalent to inquest of office found at common law.” Citing Escriche, word “Denuncia,” and several adjudicated cases. See also Racouillat v. Sansevain, 32 Cal., 386. Delivered November 30, 1892. We need not prolong the discussion of the question. We think the law is settled, and that it should be now held, as was done in the court below, that the deed to Laguerenne by Rabago conveyed to him and vested in him title to the land, that could be defeated only by some proceeding in the nature of office found, which has never been done; and therefore, according to the submission of the case as agreed, the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed. Such is the law, as enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States, and latterly by the Supreme Court of this State, sustained by the Supreme Court of California, and not controverted by any courts of last resort, except some early cases in this State, which have been overruled or disregarded by the present Supreme Court. The question now decided was not directly decided by the Supreme Court of the United States when the case was before that court on error from the judgment in the first suit. It seems the point was misapprehended, and the court declined to reopen the case for further consideration of the question on motion for rehearing, the court being “ satisfied with the conclusion it had reached.” The question was in the case, however, as intimated in the ruling denying a second motion for rehearing, and as appears from the briefs filed in this court on the motion to dismiss the appeal. Williams v. Conger, 125 U. S., 425, and same case on renewal of application for rehearing, 131 U. S., 391. The judgment of the court below is affirmed. Affirmed.","Eugene Williams v. C. P.

The introduction of the common law, by the general principles of the law of nations and by the express terms of the act adopting it, January 20, 1840, did not interfere with rules of property existing under the Constitution of 1836 and previous laws.

Aliens under the civil and Mexican laws were of two classes, and known as (1) naturalized and domiciled foreigners, and (2) transient and nonresident foreigners. The first had many privileges denied the second class. Ham. Mex. Laws, arts. 8-12; Escriche, verb. Extranjero; Law of 1842, Hall’s Mex. Laws, sec. 695; 1 Texas, 712-714; Law of March 12, 1828; Law. of Dec. 15, 1835. 7. All authorities agree that the domiciled and naturalized foreigners hold title to real estate by reason of becoming domiciled or naturalized, and that transient or nonresident foreigners could not take a perfect title. A question in later years has arisen as to whether the second class of foreigners were incapable of acquiring title to real estate, or were merely incapable of holding title after its acquisition, being subject to an inquest of office or like proceeding to adjudge its forfeiture. 8. If incapable of acquiring title, a sale to a nonresident foreigner (alien) was a nullity; if capable of acquiring, but incapable of holding title, such a sale could be avoided only upon inquest of office or like proceeding to declare the forfeiture. 9. (1) The policy of the civil and Mexican law did not allow anything to pass by a sale to a nonresident foreigner negotiated by a private subject. Nothing passed to the nonresident which could be forfeited, and hence there was no forfeiture of his title. He took none. (2) By law 6, title 5, book 3, Recopilación Novissima (1 Texas, 710), it was enated that no subject could sell real estate to a nonresident, being a decree declaring the civil law. 1 Cool. Blacks., 371. This law 6 also provided, that the title of the subject — not the alien — might be forfeited. This was a step beyond the civil law. But no method of forfeiture was provided, nor was there any in existence at the adoption of the Constitution in 1836. Gen. Prov., sec. 10. (3) It is clear there could be no forfeiture of Laguerenne’s right in the land sold. He took none by his deed of May 25, 1836. Under law 6, Rabago might have been punished and his land forfeited, if there had been also provided a proceeding for forfeiture and the forfeiture had been demanded. Until then Rabago still owned the land. But no such proceeding had been provided when the Constitution of 1836 was adopted. Law 6, title 5, book 3, R. N., 1 Texas, 710; Const. 1836, Gen. Prov., sec. 10; Law Dec. 15, 1835; Law March 12, 1828; 1 Cool. Blacks., 371; Clay v. Clay, 26 Texas, 24; Lacoste v. Odam, 26 Texas, 548; Escriche, Extranjero, arts. 12, 13. Search the civil and Mexican law and note absence of all authority prior to the decision of Barrett v. Kelly (decided by the unconstitutional military court), holding a contrary doctrine. Where is authority for such a forfeiture ? 10. There was no proceeding like inquest of office under the civil and Mexican law, applicable to private sales. Clay v. Clay, 26 Texas, 24; Cool. Blacks., 371; Touchard v. West, 5 Cal., 306; Halliday v. West, 6 Cal., 525; Const. 1886, sec. 10, Gen. Prov. 11. Several ill considered cases say denouncement under the civil and Mexican law is the corresponding remedy to inquest of office at common law. This is clearly a mistake. Denouncement corresponds more nearly to our file on vacant lands than any other proceeding. It is not a remedy for adjudging a forfeiture, but the Mexican method of filing on land, alike applicable to land always vacant as to land made vacant by act of a grantee from the State. It is not prosecuted by or for the State, but by and for the individual availing himself of it. Denouncement does not apply to sales to aliens by private contract, but to files by private individuals on public lands already vacant or abandoned, etc. Clay v. Clay, 26 Texas, 24; Lacoste v. Odam, 26 Texas, 548; Holliman v. Peebles, 1 Texas, 710; Touchard v. West, 5 Cal., 306; Halliday v. West, 6 Cal., 525; Law of March 12, 1828, arts. 6, 11; Hall Mex. Laws, 224-230; Ham. Mex. Laws, 232; Escriche, Denuncia. 12. There is a clear distinction between the effect of a public grant to a nonresident foreigner or to a colonist abandoning the grant, and the effect of a private sale to a nonresident alien. As to the first, a forfeiture would result in the land remaining the property of the State, who was the grantor, thereby becoming or remaining vacant, subject to denouncement by a Mexican for his own benefit. The second would result in the land remaining the property of the vendor, subject, under law 6, title 5, book 3, to forfeiture, when the proceeding therefor has been enacted and applied. Holliman v. Peebles, 1 Texas, 710. 13. At common law an alien could acquire title by purchase — not by descent; but he could not hold by purchase against the State. He could not acquire title by descent. An inquest of office was necessary in the first instance, because he had acquired title; but not in the second, because he could not acquire anything to be forfeited. By the law in force in Texas on May 25, 1836, a nonresident alien could neither acquire nor hold title to real estate. Both prohibitions are found in the laws of 1828, 1835, and 1836, and it is too plain for honest, intelligent denial, that a nonresident alien could neither acquire nor hold land in Texas on May 25, 1836. Law March 12, 1828; Law December 15, 1835; Schedule 1, Const. 1836; Const. 1836, Gen. Prov., sec. 10; Clay v. Clay, 26 Texas, 24; Lacoste v. Odam, 26 Texas, 458; 1 Cool. Blacks., 371. 14. The laws of Mexico now in force do not recognize a forfeiture of lands to the State, but provide for forced sales of lands granted by the State and forfeited by abandonment, and payment of proceeds to the nonresident owner. The finding by the courts that lands conveyed to an alien was forfeited to the State under the civil and Mexican law resulted from ignorance of the meaning of the term denouncement and its confusion with the inquest of office at common law. Hall Mex. Laws, 224, 230, 237, 269; Ham. Mex. Laws, 232; Barrett v. Kelly, 31 Texas, 471; Moore v. Phillips, 100 U. S., 28; Touchard v. West, 5 Cal., 305; Halliday v. West, 6 Cal., 525. J. R.

S., 208; Osterman v. Baldwin, 6 Wall., 116. It has become a rule of property, which this court will not disturb."
"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. The statement of the nature and result of this suit is thus given by counsel for appellants in their brief: “ This suit was brought by appellees, Van Evans and his wife Judith F. Evans, and John H. Evans, against the appellants, John B. Reagan, sheriff of Cherokee Count}'', and Borchard, Ehrlick & Co., a mercantile firm residing and doing business in Galveston County, and composed of M. Lasker, Dan Borchard, and David M. Ehrlick, in the District Court of Cherokee County, Texas, on the 25th day of November, 1891, to enjoin the said John B. Reagan, sheriff as aforesaid, from the execution of a writ of possession to lands described in their petition, which said writ was issued out of the District Court of Galveston County, and to remove cloud from title of said John H. Evans to said land. ‘ ‘Appellees’ petition alleged, substantially, that said Jonn H. Evans is the owner of the said land by virtue of title deraigned as follows: On the 23d of November, 1886, W. J. Addis sold said land to Judith F. Evans, wife of Van Evans, by deed of that date, and received therefor as the consideration in part a promissory note for $157.25, due January 1, 1889, payable to said Addis, or bearer, both said note and deed retaining the vendor’s lien upon said land. That said deed was filed for record in Cherokee County on the 17th day of May, 1889, and was duly recorded on May 20, 1889. “That on the 1st day of January, 1891, the said John H. Evans, in due course of trade, for value, became the owner and holder of said note, and thereafter, on the 1st day of June, 1891, said John H. Evans obtained judgment in the District Court of said Cherokee County upon said note against Judith F. Evans and Van Evans for the amount of said note, less a credit of $50, and for interest and costs of suit, and a foreclosure of said vendor’s lien on said land and an order of sale of said land for the payment of said judgment. That thereafter, by virtue of said judgment and order of sale, said land was sold by John B. Reagan, as sheriff of said county, on the 4th day of August, 1891, to the said John H. Evans, by deed of that date, which was filed for record same day and duly recorded on the day following; that said John H. Evans within thirty days thereafter was placed in possession of said land. “ Said petition further alleges the title of said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. to said land, which is deraigned as follows: That on the 24th day of January, 1890, and on the 8th day of February, 1890, the said Van Evans and Judith F. Evans made, executed, and delivered to the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. their two several deeds of trust upon said land to secure the payment of certain sums of money then acknowledged by said Judith F. and Van Evans to be due and owing to said Borchard, Ehrlick <& Co.; that said deeds of trust were duly recorded in records of deeds of said Cherokee County on their several dates. “ That on the 14th day of August, 1891, the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. recovered a judgment against said Van Evans and Judith F. Evans in the District Court of Galveston County, Texas, for the sums of money secured by said deeds of trust, with interest and costs, and foreclosing the lien upon said land created and secured by said deeds of trust, and ordering said land to be sold to satisfy said judgment, and that the purchaser at said sale be put in possession, etc. “ That thereafter, on the first Tuesday in October, 1891, said land was sold by said John B. Reagan, sheriff of said Cherokee County, under and by virtue of an order of sale issued out of the said District Court of said Galveston County, Texas, upon said last described judgment; and at said last mentioned sale said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. became the purchasers, and obtained from said sheriff his deed to said land, made by virtue of said last mentioned sale of same, said deed bearing date the 20th of October, 1891, and duly recorded in the clerk’s office of Cherokee County on same day. That the plaintiffs in said petition are in possession of said land. That said Borchard, Ehrlick & Go. claim the right of possession to said land by virtue of said title as aforesaid, and especially by virtue of the direction in said last named order of sale, ‘ that the sheriff do place the purchaser of said land in possession thereof.’ “And plaintiffs in said petition pray to have the writ of injunction made perpetual; that the title to said land be adjudged to be in said John H. Evans, and the deed from the sheriff to Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. be cancelled, and for all costs, etc. “ The appellants excepted generally and specially to the petition, ajid pleaded specially to the jurisdiction of the court. And the court having, on the 1st day of July, A. D. 1892, overruled said general and special exceptions and said plea to the jurisdiction of said court, and having rendered its judgment against the appellants Borchard, Ehrlick & Co., appellants filed their motion for a new trial, and the court having overruled said motion for new trial, appellants gave notice of appeal.” The appellants’ first assignment of error is, that e ‘ the court erred in overruling defendants’ plea to the jurisdiction of the court, because the ground of action against appellants set up in plaintiffs’ petition is an order of sale and writ of possession issued out of the District Court of Galveston County, and the relief prayed for in said petition is to perpetuate an injunction issued out of the District Court of Cherokee County, enjoining the sheriff of said Cherokee County from the execution of a writ aforesaid, issued out of the District Court of Galveston County, based upon a judgment obtained in the District Court of Galveston County in favor of appellants Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. against Judith F. Evans and Van Evans, and which said writ was made returnable to said District Court of Galveston County.” The plaintiffs’ petition alleged, that the defendant Reagan, sheriff of Cherokee County, at the instigation of the other defendants, Borchard, Ehrlick & Co., was threatening to dispossess and eject plaintiffs Van and Judith Evans from the premises in controversy, under and by virtue of a writ issued from the District Court of Galveston County upon a judgment rendered therein on the 4th of August, A. D. 1891, in a suit wherein the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. were plaintiffs and the said Van and Judith Evans were defendants, commanding said sheriff to sell said premises, and to place the purchasers in possession thereof; and that by virtue of said writ the said sheriff, as they were informed and believed, had sold said premises, and that at the sale the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. became the purchasers. And petitioners further averred, that they were advised and believed that said writ was then functus officio; that it issued on the 11th day of August, A. D. 1891, and was made returnable within ninety days, which time had then elapsed; and they averred, that the said Reagan, instigated by his codefendants, would, they feared, execute his threat to eject them from said premises, unless restrained therefrom by a writ of injunction; that said Van and Judith Evans were in possession of the premises under a lease from their coplaintiff, John Evans; that they were occupying the same as a home, and had made their preparations so to occupy it, at least until the end of the next year, and if ejected by said sheriff that they would sustain irreparable injury. They alleged the rental value of the premises, and averred that the title, as they were advised and believed, under which they were holding possession of the premises was superior to that under which the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. were asserting right to the property. From these averments, if true (and in considering the rulings of the court upon the plea they must be taken as true, since the plea to the jurisdiction was not verified by affidavit, but appellants relied on the allegations of the petition for its verification), it is evident that the writ under which the sheriff was threatening to dispossess complainants had ceased by lapse of time to be of any force or effect. Such a writ has been repeatedly held to be void. Hester v. Duprey, 46 Texas, 625; Mitchell v. Ireland, 54 Texas, 301; Towns v. Harris, 13 Texas, 507. If the writ prayed to be enjoined was void, the alleged threat of ejectment, if executed, would have been a trespass committed by the sheriff; and an injunction restraining an officer from committing a trespass can not be said to be an injunction enjoining the execution of the judgment upon which the writ issued, and if not, then the writ of injunction need not be returned to the court whence the order of sale and writ of possession emanated. We are of opinion, therefore, that the court did not err in holding the defendants’ plea to the jurisdiction to be bad. As the appellant’s second assignment of error is not copied in his brief, and as he makes neither proposition nor statement under said assignment, we consider it as waived, and will not discuss the same. The appellants’ third assignment of error impugns the correctness of' the ruling of the court upon appellants’ special exceptions to appellees’ first amended original petition, on these grounds: First. Because said amended petition sets up a different cause of action than that set up in original petition, and the relief prayed for in the amended petition could not have been granted under the averments of the original petition. Second. Because the petition shows upon its face that at the time the appellee John Evans became the owner of the alleged vendor’s lien note, and at the time of the judgment of the District Court of Cherokee County foreclosing said lien, and under which said appellee claims title to the land in controversy, the appellants, the said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co., were encumbrancers upon said land by virtue of two deeds of trust, mentioned in said petition, and as such encumbrancers, had the equity of redemption of said land, and that they were not parties to said suit in which said vendor’s lien was foreclosed; and that said petition neither discloses nor alleges any fact or facts which would bind appellants by said judgment or the sale made thereunder. As to the first of these two grounds of objection urged to the judgment of the court overruling appellants’ special exception to the amended petition, it is sufficient, we think, to say, that the court had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject matter of the suit, and the petition presented a good cause of action; and even if the cause of action set out in the amended petition was another and a different one to that presented in the original petition, if was competent for the court to permit the suit to proceed under such terms and conditions as in its judgment were proper; and if the appellants were surprised by the averments of the amended petition, or for any other sufficient cause they desired a postponement or continuance of the cause, they should have made application to the court for such postponement or continuance; and not having done so, they can not now be heard to complain of the judgment of the court in overruling their exception. The second ground of objection is based upon the assumption, that as the deeds of trust mentioned in plaintiffs’ petition showed that appellants Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. were encumbrancers before the purchase of the vendor’s lien note, and before the institution of his suit by the said appellee John Evans for the foreclosure of said lien, the said appellants were necessary parties to said suit, in order to convey title to appellee John Evans under the decree of foreclosure. The vendor’s lien was expressly retained in the deed conveying the land from J. Addis to Edith Evans, under whom both appellants and appellee John Evans claim title. Had Addis brought suit on the note, it is well settled by the decisions of the Supreme Court of this State, that appellants would not have been necessary parties. Ufford v. Wells, 52 Texas, 619, and authorities there cited; Silberberg v. Pearson, 75 Texas, 288. And as Addis, the assignor of the note, held the superior legal title to the land in trust for the benefit of his assignee, we think the rule announced in the cases cited, supra, is as applicable to this case as if the vendor, Addis, were the plaintiff, instead of his assignee, John Evans. But if we are mistaken in this, unless Evans knew of the subsequent lien acquired by the mortgagees, Borchard, Ehrlick & Co., then he was not required to make them parties to his suit to foreclose the vendor’s lien. Webb v. Maxan, 11 Texas, 340. And there is nothing in the record which shows, or would authorize us to conclude, that Evans, the plaintiff, knew of the mortgages executed by the vendee of the land to Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. at the time he instituted his suit. The mortgagees were not in possession of the premises. The registration of the mortgages was not notice to plaintiff. He was not asserting or claiming any rights under the mortgagor. The registration of the vendor’s deed was notice to the subsequent encumbrancers of the vendor’s lien, but the registration of the mortgages executed by the vendee was not notice of the mortgagee’s lien, to either the vendor or to the vendor’s assignee. Our conclusion is, therefore, that the mortgagees were not necessary parties to the suit for foreclosing the vendor’s lien, and that the judgment must be affirmed. But it is the opinion of the majority of the court, that the mortgagees, the appellants here, are not precluded by the judgment of the lower court from yet asserting any equities against the land secured to them by their mortgages, a proposition to which the writer of this opinion is not prepared to give his assent. The judgment therefore is affirmed without prejudice to appellants. And if the land be of greater value than the amount of the plaintiff Evans’ debt, such excess of value, or so much thereof as may be necessary, may be subjected to the payment of appellants’ mortgage debts. Affirmed. Delivered January 12, 1893.","John B. Reagan et al. v. Van Evans et al. No. 29. 1. Jurisdiction of Suits to Enjoin a Trespass.—Appellee John Evans was the assignee of a vendor's lien note, dated November 23, 1886, and signed by Van Evans and wife. He obtained foreclosure judgment; the land was sold thereunder, and he became the purchaser and was placed in possession. Appellants Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. were the holders of two deeds of trust made by Van Evans and wife, dated January 24 and February S, 1890, to secure a debt due B., E. & Co., which was foreclosed in Galveston, with order that the purchaser be placed in possession. At sale made thereunder B., E. & Co. became the purchasers. This suit was to enjoin the sheriff of Cherokee County, Reagan, from executing the writ of possession from Galveston County. Held, that the District Court of Cherokee County had jurisdiction. 2. Same.—Plaintiffs’ petition averred that the writ of possession was made returnable within ninety days, which time had elapsed. Appellants did not verify their plea to the jurisdiction, but relied upon the allegations of the petition for verification, which must be taken as true; and from which it is evident that the writ had ceased to have any force or effect. If the writ was void, the threatened ejectment, if executed, would have been a trespass committed by the sheriff, and an injunction to restrain it is not an injunction restraining the execution of the judgment upon which the writ issued, and need not be returned to the court where judgment was obtained. 3. ""V""oid Writ.—A writ returnable in ninety days is void after the ninety days has elapsed. 4. Amendment Setting up a New Cause of Action. —When the court has jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject matter of the suit, and the petition presented a good cause of action, it was competent for the court to permit an amendment which set up another and different cause of action, subject to the right of the defendant to ask a continuance on the ground of surprise. 5. Subsequent Encumbrancers, When not Necessary Parties.— Though B., E. & Co. were encumbrancers prior to the institution of John Evans’ foreclosure suit, and though he was only the assignee of the note, with the superior title to the land held by his assignor in trust for him, unless he knew of the subsequent lien of B., E. & Co., he was not required to make them parties. 6. Notice of Subsequent Lien.—Mortgagees were not in possession of the land, and the registration of their mortgages was not notice of the lien, either to the vendor of the land or his vendee John Evans. He was not asserting or claiming any rights under the mortgagors, Van Evans and wife. 7. Rights of Subsequent Lien Holders.—It is the opinion of a majority of the court, that appellants are not precluded by the judgment of the court below from yet asserting any equities against the land secured to them by their mortgages, if the land be of greater value than the vendor’s lien debt. Appeal from Cherokee. Tried below before Hon. Geo. F. Ingraham. Gregg & Morris, for appellants. 1. The court erred in overruling defendants’ plea to the jurisdiction of the court, because the ground of action against appellants set up in plaintiffs’ petition is an order of sale and writ of possession issued out of the District Court of Galveston County, and the relief prayed for in said petition is to perpetuate an injunction issued out of the District Court of Cherokee County, enjoining the sheriff of said Cherokee County from the execution of a writ aforesaid, issued out of the District Court of Galveston County, based upon a judgment obtained in said District Court of Galveston County in favor of appellants Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. against Judith F. Evans and Van Evans, and which said writ was made returnable to said District Court of Galveston County. Rev. Stats., art. 2880; Seligson & Co. v. Collins, 64 Texas, 314. 2. Said land not being a homestead, the two deeds of trust mentioned in plaintiffs’ petition, which were of record in the office of the county clerk of Cherokee County long before John H. Evans became the purchaser of said vendor’s lien note, and before he brought suit to foreclose said lien, conveyed the equity of redemption to Borchard, Ehrlick & Co.; and said record was legal notice to the owner and holder of said note that said Borchard, Ehrlick & Co. were junior encumbrancers on said land, and as such were proper and necessary parties to said foreclosure suit.

After its return day has passed, a writ of execution is not legal process, and to enjoin its execution is not enjoining the execution of the judgment on which it issued, nor is it staying proceedings in the suit in which it issued. The writ enjoined was issued August 11, 1891. It was returnable within ninety days from its date. Appellees’ suit to enjoin it was filed November 25, 1891. Towns v. Harris, 13 Texas, 507; Young v. Smith, 23 Texas, 598; Hester v. Duprey, 46 Texas, 625; Mitchell v. Ireland, 54 Texas, 301. 2. When a writ of injunction is issued in favor of a party claiming to have lawful possession of land, and who sues to protect his possession thereof against process on a judgment, however valid and regular it may be, to which he was not a party, and under which his lawful possession in no event could be disturbed, such writ of injunction is not necessarily returnable to and triable only in the court where such judgment was rendered.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On the 4th day of May, 1888, appellees instituted this suit in the County Court of Dallas County, against appellants, William Gentry and S. C. Gentry, to recover upon a note for $271.66, and to foreclose a mortgage alleged to have been given by said Gentrys upon one Steadman engine, one Steadman boiler and fixtures, one Coleman corn mill, one Fairbanks scales, one Steadman steam press, and all belting, pulleys, shafting, and fixtures belonging to said machinery, to secure the payment of said note. Appellants answered in a plea to the jurisdiction, alleging, that the machinery embraced in said mortgage at the time the same was given were fixtures constituting a part of the homestead of appellant William Gentry, who was a married man and the head of a family, and by reason of the fact alleged that the County Court had no jurisdiction to decree such foreclosure. They also pleaded the same facts in a special answer, and in addition thereto alleged, that appellees had sued out a writ of sequestration in this case, and had taken actual possession of said machinery and said appellant’s premises upon which the same were situated, and had deprived him of the use thereof; and that the use of said machinery and premises during the time he had been so deprived of the same was worth the sum of $550, for which amount he prayed judgment against appellees. To this answer appellees interposed general and special exceptions. The special exceptions were, (1) that said answer did not allege of whom defendant’s family consists; (2) that the court had no jurisdiction ""to hear and determine the question as to defendant’s ownership of the land; (3) because said answer does not set out a specific account, in what defendant’s damages consisted, or the several items thereof; (4) because the said answer does not set out and define the defendant’s said homestead; (5) because the court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the subject matter set out in said answer. From the judgment rendered by the court, it would seem that only the special exceptions were sustained; but from a bill of exceptions in the record we find that the general demurrer also was sustained, and appellants were not allowed to introduce evidence in support of their answer. We are of opinion that the action of the court was error. The answer does show that appellant William Gentry, at the time of the execution of the mortgage and at the time of the trial, had a wife and several children. It was certainly not necessary to give their names. The plea to the jurisdiction of the court stated very clearly and succinctly, that at the time of the execution of the mortgage and at the time of the trial the machinery embraced in the mortgage was a fixture attached to the land; that the land consisted of 160 acres, upon which appellant William Gentry resided with his family, and that the mortgaged property therefore constituted a part of his homestead and of the land to which it was attached. We infer from the brief of appellants that because of these allegations the court below held that it had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the same. Had these allegations appeared in the petition instead of the answer, we hardly think the court would have attempted to foreclose this mortgage. Not appearing in the petition, it was proper for them to appear in the answer; and if the evidence supported these allegations, the court would clearly be without jurisdiction to grant the foreclosure. Certainly the court has the right to hear the necessary evidence to enable it to decide as to whether or not it has power to try the case it is sought to have it adjudicate, whether the allegations disclosing such want of jurisdiction appear in the petition of the plaintiff or in the plea to the jurisdiction by the defendant. The plea of the defendants clearly shows that the plaintiffs were seeking to have the County Court foreclose a mortgage upon real estate, and the court should have heard evidence upon this question, and if the plea was sustained should not have attempted to entertain jurisdiction of this part of the case. Appellees’ second and fifth special exceptions were therefore improperly sustained. The damage claimed by appellants was for the use and rental value of the machinery and premises during the time it was alleged to have been taken from their possession by the writ of sequestration; and while upon this branch of the case their allegations are somewhat general, yet we deem them sufficient. No attempt was made to treat the acts of appellees as a conversion of the property, but a recovery was sought for its use only. This was proper. Willis & Bro. v. Morris, 66 Texas, 628. Appellees’ third special exception was therefore improperly sustained. In describing his homestead, appellant William Gentry in his answer alleged, that “at the date of said mortgage and long prior thereto, he was, and is now, a married man and the head of a family consisting of a wife, then and now living, and six minor children, then and now living with him; that with his said family he occupied and used as a homestead and farm to support his said family a tract of land of 160 acres in Fannin County, Texas, cultivating the same as a farm, and having his dwelling house thereon, in which he lives with his said family, and a gin house and cotton gin and corn mill thereon. That the Coleman corn mill, Steadman steam press, Fairbanks scales, with the shafting, pulleys, and fixtures thereto attached, and being the same described in plaintiffs’ petition and mortgage attached thereto, and on which a lien is so sought to be foreclosed, were permanently attached as fixtures to said 160 acres of land, and are a part thereof, and to said cotton gin, corn mill, and gin house at the date of said mortgage, and long prior thereto and are now, so attached.” We do not perceive what better description could be asked, and we are therefore of opinion that appellants’ fourth special exception was improperly sustained. That such machinery as this, if attached to a country homestead by the owner as alleged in this answer, would become a part thereof and not subject to mortgage after it was so attached, we think clear. Railway v. Winter, 44 Texas, 597; Hutchins v. Masterson, 46 Texas, 551; Harkey v. Cain, 69 Texas, 146; Willis & Bros. v. Morris, supra. We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance herewith, and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 23, 1893.","William Gentry and S. C. Gentry v. Bowser & Lemmon. No. 803. 1. Jurisdiction of County Court—Fixtures to Realty.—Where, before a chattel mortgage is given thereon, machinery such as a corn mill, steam engine, and press, with belting, etc., is so attached to realty as to become a fixture, and part thereof, the County Court is without jurisdiction to foreclose such mortgage. 2. Same—Pleading—Power to Determine Jurisdiction.—A writ of sequestration, issued in an action in the County Court to foreclose a chattel mortgage, having been levied on certain machinery, the defendant pleaded that such machinery was a fixture to realty, and attached as such to his homestead place when the mortgage was given. Held, that a demurrer to such answer and plea, urged on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to determine the ownership of the land, was improperly sustained, and that the court had power to determine its jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit, whether the allegations disclosing a want of such jurisdiction appeared in the petition or in the answer. 3. Same — Jurisdiction of Claim of Damages for Rental Value of Realty.—Where, under a writ of sequestration issued from the County Court, machinery constituting a fixture to realty is levied on and taken into possession, together with the premises on which it is situated, the defendant may in that suit properly plead against the plaintiff a claim of damages for the rental value and use of such property while he was so deprived of its possession, his plea therefor not alleging the acts of the plaintiff as a conversion of the property. 4. Homestead — Fixtures Thereto not Subject to Mortgage. — Where the owner of a country homestead places machinery thereon in such manner that it becomes a fixture to the realty, such machinery is not subject to mortgage after being so attached. 5. Pleadings—Special Exceptions not Well Taken.—See the opinion for pleadings by way of answer held sufficient as against special exceptions urged for failure to itemize a claim of damages caused by a levy on certain fixtures, and for failure to give a more specific description of defendant’s homestead and family.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellant can not be held liable for delay which was caused by its connecting lines, in the absence of proof of negligence on its own part. No partnership between it and such other lines, nor any other facts, were shown under which it would be responsible for delay on the part of other carriers. The case of Railway v. Baird, 75 Texas, 256, is conclusive upon this point. Every fact upon which joint liability with connecting lines for their negligence was sought to be fixed upon the last carrier in this case was present in that; and in addition there was in that case an undertaking of the railway carrier to transport the stock over the whole route, while here the bill of lading was only to East St. Louis. We must hold, therefore, that if delay did not result from appellant’s own wrong, it is not liable. On the other hand, if appellant wrongfully refused to receive and forward appellee’s goods on to their destination when they were tendered to it at St. Louis, thus causing the delay, it would be liable. The uncontradicted evidence shows, that a shipment of goods, including those of appellee, was tendered to appellant by the agents of the Wabash line, over which it had arrived at East St. Louis, and was rejected by appellant because a part of the goods had been damaged. The case containing the goods of appellee was erroneously “ billed” (by which we understand the witnesses to mean the designation of the property upon the way bills), not to appellee, but to another person, to whom also the damaged goods were consigned. The case belonging to appellee was not separately tendered to appellant, but the tender was of all the goods in one lot, including those that were damaged. Appellant had adopted a regulation that it would not receive goods that had been damaged while in the hands of other roads unless it was indemnified against liability for such damage. Upon its refusal, on this ground, to accept the freight, it was returned to the warehouse of the Wabash line, and remained there until the agents of that line were instructed to deliver to appellant the undamaged part of the shipment, and this was the occasion of the delay. The rule which appellant thus enforced was a reasonable one. When goods are delivered at their destination in a damaged condition, the presumption arises that they received such damages while in the hands of the last carrier, and this regulation was an appropriate and legitimate means by which appellant might protect itself against danger of liability for a wrong which it had not committed. The record shows, that in the discussion between the agents of the Wabash line and those of appellant, the former expressed the opinion that -the damage to the package was only trifling, but the amount was not assessed, and the indemnity demanded by appellant was refused. The extent of the damage is not otherwise shown. The carrier in whose hands the injury had occurred could not force appellant to receive the goods and take the risk of a suit by the consignor. There being no connection or relation by which appellant was bound by the contract of the carriers through whose hands the goods had passed, the agents of the Wabash, in-seeking to ship over its road, were bound to comply with its reasonable regulations. Appellee’s loss from this delay thus arose through the fault of other lines, for whose acts and omissions appellant is not responsible.. It follows that appellant, when the goods reached Marshall, had the right to hold them until the freight charges were paid, and that appellee can not recover for the detention of the property resulting from his refusal to pay such charges when it was tendered to him. The judgment will therefore be reversed and rendered for appellant. Reversed and rendered.. Delivered January 26, 1893.","Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. M. L. Weisman. No. 207. 1. Delay Caused by Connecting Lines. — Appellant can not be held liable for delay which was caused by its connecting lines, in the absence of proof of negligence on its own part. But if appellant wrongfully refused to receive and forward appellee’s goods to their destination when they were tendered to it at St. Louis, thus causing the delay, it would be liable. 2. Regulation as to Receiving Freight—Appellant had adopted a regulation that it would not receive goods that had been damaged while in the hands of other roads, unless it was indemnified against liability for such damages. Appellee’s freight was damaged when tendered to appellant by the Wabash road. That road could n'ot force appellant to receive the goods and take the risk of suit by the consignee. The regulation was reasonable, and appellee’s loss by delay arose through the fault of the other lines, for whose acts and omissions appellant is not responsible, and appellee can not recover. 3. Refusal to Pay Charges.—When the goods arrived at Marshall, appellee refused to pay the charges. Appellant had the right to hold them until the charges were paid, and appellee can not recover for the detention resulting from his refusal to pay charges. Appeal from Harrison. Tried below before Hon. A. H. Coopee. F. H. Prendergast, for appellant. 1. The court erred in holding the defendant liable for the $157 damage, because the delay and damage occurred on a road other than defendant’s line, and the goods were not shipped on a through bill of lading, and the bill of lading did not extend over defendant’s line.

The court did not err in finding that the Missouri Pacific Railway Company was liable for the damages ($157) on the goods at the time when they arrived at their destination, because it clearly appeared from the evidence, that the Missouri Pacific Railway Company was one of a line of carriers who were engaged in the transportation of goods from New York to Marshall, Texas, and held themselves out to the public as such line of carriers, and had been engaged for more than two years in such transportation, either with or without through bills of lading. 1 W. & W.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. This suit originated in the Justice Court, where appellee pleaded in offset to the account sued on by appellant a number of items; and on appeal to the County Court he was permitted, over the objection of the appellant, to add to this counter-claim items aggregating 8107.45 more than the sums pleaded by him in the Justice Court. We think this was error. It has been settled that article 316 of the Revised Statutes, which prohibits any setoff or counter-claim from being set up by the defendant in the County Court which was not pleaded in the court below, in cases brought by certiorari, applies as well to a case taken to the County Court by appeal. Curry v. Terrell, 1 W. & W. C. C., 239; Blanton v. Langston, 60 Texas, 149. The only answer appellee makes to this is, that appellant was himself permitted to amend his claim by adding new items in the County Court. This, however, seems to have been done without objection from appellee, and we are of opinion that this furnishes no sufficient reason for overruling the objection of appellant. We do not wish, however, to be understood as holding that the amendment' made by appellant was subject to exception had it been interposed by appellee. As to this we express no opinion. One of the items in appellee’s counter-claim was 820, claimed to have been paid by A. S. Connellee, a brother of appellee, to appellant, and to prove this item said Connellee was allowed to testify in reference to its payment, over the objection of appellant, as follows: “I do not know anything from my own personal knowledge, but I do from circumstances. My wife told me that I borrowed 820 from her, and that at the time I borrowed it I told her I wanted it to pay Dr. Downtain for brother Charley; but I do not know whether I paid it or not, or anything further about it.” That this evidence was pure hearsay and inadmissible, we think quite too clear for argument. For the errors above indicated, the judgment of the court below 17111 be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 3, 1893.","L. C. Downtain v. C. U. Connellee.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. The State of Texas filed a petition, by the district attorney for the Twenty-third Judicial District, in the District Court of Wharton County, September 9, 1892, against Frank Page, and alleged that on or about July 26, 1882, the defendant, in accordance with an act of the Legislature approved July 8, 1879, to provide for the sale of the school land, and of the acts amendatory thereof, approved April 6, 1881, and Hay 6, 1882, applied for the purchase of alternate section 46, surveyed by virtue of certificate 114 for the Washington County Railway Company, situated in Wharton County; that this application ""Has duly recorded by the surveyor of said county, and the defendant executed and forwarded to the Treasurer of the State his obligation for the sum of $608, agreeing to pay the Governor of the State and his successors in office, on the first day of January of each year, one-twentieth of said sum, with interest on the full amount of the principal unpaid at the date of each payment of interest; and that said obligation and said application, and one-twentieth of the purchase money, to-wit, $32, were forwarded to the State Treasurer at Austin, and was by him received and receipted for, and said receipt and application were duly filed in the General Land Office on August 2, 1882, in accordance with law. It was further alleged, that since March 1, 1888, the defendant had failed to pay interest, etc.; that the defendant had forfeited his claim to said land; and judgment was prayed for title and possession of the land, and that said sale and purchase be set aside, annulled, and declared forfeited. Mary E. Kuykendall was also made a party defendant as claiming some interest in the land. On October 12, 1892, the El Campo Land Company filed a petition in intervention, and claimed to be the owners of the land by purchase from the defendant Frank Page, and to have paid the balance of the purchase money and interest to the State. On October 25, 1892, the appellant F. W. Schilling intervened in the suit. His first amended original petition in intervention was filed November 10, 1892. He alleged, that on the 9th day of September, 1892, he actually settled upon and occupied in good faith the said section 46 described in plaintiff’s petition, with the intent and purpose to make of said land a homestead by purchase under the acts for the sale of the public school lands of the State. Then followed allegations with respect to the purchase of the defendant Page, and his subsequent failure to pay the interest as alleged in the petition of the State, and averment that the said defendant bad forfeited his right to the land, etc. He further averred, ‘ ‘ that being advised of the forfeiture of said pretended purchase under the law by virtue of which said purchase wras made, and being so advised of the status of said defendant’s and intervenor’s title, if any they have ever had, which this intervenor denies, from the records of the General Land Oflice and State Treasurer’s office, the Commissioner of the General Land Office did, on September 3, 1892, in compliance with law, instruct the district attorney of the Twenty-third Judicial District to bring suit for possession of said tract of land, and for the ejectment of the defendant Page therefrom,” etc.; and that if the El Campo Land Company had paid the balance of the purchase money, the receipt thereof by the officer of the State was unauthorized and void. Further, 6 ‘ that he is now', and has been since the 9th day of September, 1892, an actual settler in good faith upon said described tract of land, having tendered to the Treasurer of the State the sum of $32, being one-fortieth of the- value thereof, together with his obligation for the remainder, as provided by law, which was refused until a copy of the judgment of ejectment was filed, as required by law. That there is not now and has never been any actual possession of said land either by defendant Page or any other person save your intervenor; and that he is actually residing thereon as his home, and desires to purchase same under the acts authorizing the sale of the public school lands of Texas.” He also replied to the plea in intervention of the El Campo Land Company by a general denial and plea of not guilty. To said petition in intervention the defendant Page and the El Campo Land Company demurred: (1) That the petition was insufficient in law, and showed no right, title, nor interest in the land in controversy as against any of the other parties to the suit. (2) Because it did not state in what particulars the defendant Page or the intervenors failed to comply with the law in acquiring title to the land ""in controversy. The case was called for trial on November 10, 1892, when the demurrers of the defendant Page and the El Campo Land Company to the petition of intervention by Schilling were heard and sustained; and then the district attorney, in behalf of the State, by reason of instructions from the State Treasurer and the Commissioner of the General Land Office, notifying him of the payment by defendant of the full amount of the balance of the purchase money and interest due on the land in controversy since the institution of the suit, and requesting him to discontinue this suit, which appears from the recitals in the judgment, refused to prosecute any further against the defendant or the El Campo Land Company, and judgment was entered in favor of such defendants; and Schilling having declined to amend, the El Campo Land Company was declared subrogated to the rights of the defendant Page, and judgment was rendered in its favor against all parties for the title and possession of the land. The contention of appellant is, that the purchase became ipso facto forfeited by the failure of Page or of his vendees to make the payment of interest in accordance with the law; and that having settled on the land, and made application for the purchase and tendered the first payment and his note for the balance of the purchase money as required by law, he was entitled to recover the same. The suit was instituted by the district attorney in accordance with section 12 of the Act of 1879 (Laws, page 26), under which the purchase was made, to have the forfeiture established. This section provides: “If, upon the 1st day of March following the maturity of any payment, the interest on money due has not been paid to the State Treasurer, and his receipt filed with the Commissioner of the General Land Office as provided in section 11 of this act, it shall be the duty of said Commissioner to notify the county or district attorney of the county in which such land is situated of such failure, giving the name of the purchaser so failing to make payment, with the amount and date of his note, and the amount of principal and interest due at the time of such failure; and upon the receipt of such notice it shall be the duty of the county or district attorney •to cause a writ to be issued and served on -the purchaser, or, in case of his death, upon his heirs or legal representatives, requiring him or them to show cause why he or they should not be ejected from such land; and upon his or their failure to show that the annual installments of interest have been paid as above provided, a judgment shall be rendered against him or them, and a writ of possession shall be issued in favor of the State. That a copy of such judgment, under the signature and seal of the clerk of the court rendering the judgment, shall be forwarded to the State Treasurer, who shall immediately endorse the obligation of such purchaser ‘forfeited,’ note the fact of such endorsement on the copy of judgment aforesaid, and forward the same to the Commissioner of the General Land Office. The said Commissioner shall file said copy of judgment with the claim of such defaulting purchaser, and shall note such forfeiture on the account kept with said purchaser, and shall notify the surveyor of the county in which said land is situated that said land is again for sale.” It was a suit, therefore, to have the forfeiture of the purchase declared, and for the restoration of the land to the State. Although the act declares that upon the failure of the purchaser to show that the annual installments of interest have been paid as provided, judgment should be rendered against him, we do not think that the proviso does more than to require the payment of the money in the manner prescribed before the case has been called for trial. The object of the statute was to sell the land and provide a fund for the common schools, and this purpose is made manifest by the subsequent laws declaring that there shall be no forfeiture for nonpayment of the principal and extending from time to time the payment of the interest. It was no doubt the intention of the Legislature in requiring the forfeiture to be ascertained in the District Court to afford the purchaser the opportunity of obtaining such equitable relief as he might show himself to be entitled to; and a familiar principle of relief belonging to equity is, that the vendee be allowed to complete his purchase by payment of the balance of the purchase"" money and interest. In submitting the matter to the courts it was not intended to deprive them of the exercise of the right to administer the same principles that apply to other cases coming within their jurisdiction. We are furthermore of the opinion, that appellant’s petition in intervention did not show that he had acquired any right to the land. Whatever rights he acquired arose under the Act of 1887, amended in 1889. Laws 1887, p. 83; Laws 1889, p. 50. His petition does not show that the land was ever restored to the school fund by the filing of the copy of the judgment of forfeiture as prescribed in the Act of 1879; it does not show that the lands were ever classified or appraised, nor, except inferentially, at what price the land was to be sold by the State, which is to be inferred only from the amount of the cash payment which it was alleged had been tendered. He does not even allege that he had ever made application for the purchase of the land. The only allegations in the petition of appellant to show his right to the land were, that he was an actual settler thereon in good faith, with the intent and purpose to make the land a homestead by purchase under the acts for the sale of the public school land, having tendered to the Treasurer of the State the sum of $32, being one-fortieth of the value thereof, together with his obligation for the remainder, as provided by law. His petition should show such facts as would entitle him to enforce his right to purchase the land, and in this respect it is fatally defective. There was no error in sustaining the demurrers to the appellant’s petition in intervention, and the judgment of the court below will be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 30, 1893.","F. W. Schilling v. The State of Texas. No. 230. 1. Public Lands—Right to Acquire for Homestead by Purchase. The State having sued a purchaser for land for nonpayment of interest, S. intervened and claimed it as a bona fide settler, intending to purchase it for a homestead. His petition did not show that the land had ever been restored to the school fund by the filing of the copy of the judgment of forfeiture, nor that the lands were ever classified or appraised, nor that he had made application for the purchase of it. He only states that he was an actual settler thereon in good faith, with intent and purpose to make the land a homestead by purchase, and that he had tendered to the Treasurer one-fortieth of its value. The petition is fatally defective, and demurrer to it was rightly sustained. 2. Right to Pay for School Land Purchased After Suit to Forfeit.—September 9,1892, the State sued Page, the purchaser, for the title and possession of a section of land he had purchased, upon the ground of nonpayment of purchase money. October 12,1892, the El Campo Land Company intervened, claiming to be the owners of the land by purchase from Page, and to have paid the balance of the purchase money and interest to the State. November 10, under instruction from the State Treasurer, notifying him of the payment of the full amount of the purchase money and interest, the case was discontinued by the district attorney, and judgment rendered in favor of the El Campo Company for title and possession. Held, failure to pay interest when due does not ipso facto work a forfeiture. We do not think that the statute does more than to require the payment of the money in the manner prescribed, before the ease has been called for trial. 3. Same —Object of Ascertaining Forfeiture in the Courts. — It was no doubt the intention of the Legislature in requiring the forfeiture to be ascertained in the District Court, to afford the purchaser the opportunity of obtaining such equitable relief as he might show himself entitled to; and a familiar principle of equity is, that the vendee be allowed to complete his purchase by payment of the balance of the purchase money and interest. Appeal from Wharton. Tried below before Hon. John A. Ballowe, Special Judge. John E. Linn, for appellant. 1. The payment of the purchase money and interest in accordance with the law was a condition precedent to the acquisition of any title or right in the land from the State; and breach of the condition by him on whom the burden rested left the parties in the same attitude as if no purchase had been made, and the actual possessor has superior rights of purchasing under existing laws as against him who-committed the breach while out of possession.

The title of the State can not pass except by legislative grant or by patent signed by the proper authorities in obedience to law; and the failure to perfect an inchoate right to land by noncompliance with the law of the grant can not be remedied except by legislative action. The authority extends to no other department of government. Saunders v. Hart, 57 Texas, 10; Alexander v. The State, 56 Ga., 486; Const., art. 4, sec. 23, art. 2, sec. 1. 3. Without a literal compliance with the statute regulating sales of public school land, the purchaser acquired no right, either inchoate or equitable, that can be enforced against one in possession.

The contract of sale between the State and the purchaser of school land under the Act of July 8, 1879, and Act of April 6, 1881, vested in the purchaser an equitable estate, upon condition subject to forfeiture at suit of the State on failure to pay the annual installment of interest as required by said acts. And under section 7 of said acts the surveyor was not authorized to entertain another application to purchase said land until notified of the forfeiture, as provided in section 12 of said act.

The purchaser under the Acts of July 8, 1879, and April 6, 1881, on complying with the requirements of said acts up to and including the payment of one-twentieth of the purchase money on the land purchased by him, acquired a vested right in the land so purchased, and his subsequent failure to pay the annual installment of interest constituted only ground for forfeiture; and the State, through her lawfully authorized agents, certainly had the right at any time before judgment to accept the balance due on the land and waive the forfeiture.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Action by T. M. Campbell, as receiver of the International & Great Northern Railway, brought in the District Court of Smith County, to enjoin appellee, as collector of taxes of said county, from collecting certain taxes assessed against said railway on money in the hands of appellant as receiver for the years 1890 and 1891, and to enjoin the sale of certain property which had been levied on by said collector therefor. A temporary injunction was granted by the judge in chambers. On trial of the cause, March 17, 1892, the court sustained general and special demurrers to the petition and trial amendment; and plaintiff having declined to further amend, the cause was dismissed at his cost, and as receiver he was ordered to pay the taxes sought to be enjoined. The seizure of the property was made on February 4, 1892, and plaintiff at once applied to the court, by a petition filed in the cause No. 3123, Jay Gould v. The International & Great Northern Railway Company, and obtained a temporary restraining order for five days until he could prepare an original petition for injunction. This order was granted by the judge, and this suit for injunction was then instituted. Plaintiff’s first amended original petition, filed March 15, 1892, and his trial amendment filed March 16, 1892, show his cause of action substantially as follows: That plaintiff was the duly appointed and acting receiver of the International & Great Northern Railway in a suit of Jay Gould v. The International & Great Northern Railway Company, No. 3123, and as such receiver was, and had been for more than six months past, in possession of and operating the International & Great Northern Railway, together with all its property; that defendant, Ed. B. Wiggins, was the tax collector of Smith County; that on February 4, 1892, said tax collector, under the provisions of article 4746, Revised Statutes of Texas, levied on, seized, and took into his possession, and from the possession of plaintiff as receiver, certain cars, fully described by number and character, and certain real estate, also fully described; all of said property being the property of the International & Great Northern Railway Company, in the hands of plaintiff as receiver. It was averred, that the ears were situated upon the main line and track of the company in the city of Tyler, and were necessary to the operation of said railroad; that by the levy the main line and switches were blocked, and the traffic upon the main line of said railway through the city of Tyler was impeded and materially interfered with. Plaintiff averred, that on February 4, 1892, the court had granted a temporary injunction, to continue in force no longer than five days, provided that plaintiff did not file within said time an original suit by injunction for a temporary and permanent injunction to restrain the defendant. The plaintiff feared that said property, or other property in his hands, would again be seized and was threatened with seizure by the defendant; and he charged that said levy and impending seizure would work irreparable injury to him as receiver, and to the property in his hands, by in a measure suspending and blocking the traffic upon said road and rendering him liable to shippers for delays, for failure to furnish cars, and in receiving and forwarding shipments, and by clouding and complicating the title to said real estate by a sale for taxes. It was alleged, that said seizure was made for the purpose of satisfying certain assessments made by the tax assessor of Smith County for State and county taxes upon the property of the International & Great Northern Railway Company, on account of certain supposed deposits with the bank of Bonner & Bonner, in Tyler, Smith County, Texas, assessed as “ money on hand;” that said assessments were on the sum of $402,598.90 for the year 1890, and on the sum of $274,485.41 for the year 1891; and the taxes for which the seizure was made amounted for the year 1890 to the sum of $3925.33, and for the year 1891 to the sum of $2584.48. Plaintiff alleged, that all of the money on which the tax was levied was money earned by the International & Great Northern Railway, and not acquired by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern -Railway Company or the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, and was therefore exempt from taxation under the special act of the Legislature of Texas, approved March 10, 1875, the whole of which act he set out in his trial amendment, as well as the act of the Legislature incorporating the International Railway Company, passed August 5, 1870. Plaintiff further alleged, that he was informed and believed, and so charged, that the receivers of the International & Great Northern Railway had no such amount of funds in the hands of said bank at the dates mentioned, nor indeed any amount above the liabilities of the receivers to other roads and individuals on account of debts and freight balances due on account of exchange of freight with other roads. That all of the funds arising from the operation of the railway were deposited by the receivers with said bank pursuant to the order of the District Court of Smith County, and all freight balances and dues to other lines and individuals were paid therefrom; that in fact a very large percentage of the funds so deposited was not the property of the receivers, but belonged to other lines. Plaintiff attached to his petition as an exhibit a copy of a protest filed for plaintiff by his cashier .with the Commissioners Court of Smith County, sitting as a board of equalization, on July 23, 1891, which he alleged was a true and correct statement of the condition of said deposit; and that on August 6, 1891, the said board of equalization fixed the assessments at the amounts as before alleged. Said statement showed the amount of the deposit with Bonner & Bonner to be on January 1, 1890, $604,990.54. It showed liabilities of the receivers of that date, which were claimed as deductions: (1) Cash collections for other railways, on account of freight, tickets, and car service in transit........$152,391 64 (2) Rent on Colorado River bridge....... 15,500 00 (3) Lease of Galveston, Houston & Henderson Railway... 25,850 00 (4) Cash on Jay Gould judgment, actually paid, but not credited in books for want of voucher............ 50,000 00 (5) Pay rolls and pay checks................... 142,982 83 Vouchers for supplies and salaries of officers......... 281,741 79 Total............................................ $668,466 26 604,990 54 Balance .......................................... $63,476 72 It also showed credits due the International & Great Northern Railway from other roads on account of freight, tickets, and car services on January 1, 1890, $403,785.16. There was also a similar statement made by exhibit for January 1, 1891. That there was a memorandum made on each assessment as fixed by the board, signed by W. S. Herndon as “general solicitor for the receivers,” as follows: “ This assessment agreed to by the receivers of the International & Great Northern Railway, August 6, 1891.” That at the time of the signing of said memoranda, plaintiff was one of the receivers of said railway jointly with T. R. Bonner, and that the said W. S. Herndon had not the power and authority, without the knowledge and consent of plaintiff, to enter into, in the name of the receivers, any such contract or agreement, and that the same was made without the knowledge or consent of plaintiff, and was not binding on plaintiff or the property which he represented. He further charged, that although the books of Bonner & Bonner showed that on January 1, 1890, and on January 1, 1891, the receivers had large sums of money on deposit, yet in truth the said bank had in its vaults or in its possession on January 1, 1890, from all sources, in money, only the sum of $59,557.85, and on January 1, 1891, in money, only the sum of $38,722.77; that of the money on hand in said bank on January 1, 1890, $54,569.85 consisted of the United States nontaxable notes, and of the amount on hand January 1, 1891, $31,722.77 consisted of United States nontaxable notes, leaving the amount of taxable moneys on hand in said bank on January 1, 1890, from all sources, $4988, and the amount of taxable moneys on hand from all sources on January 1, 1891, the sum of $7000, which sums were assessed against Bonner & Bonner, as shown by the assessment rolls; and if the said receivers had any balance in their favor on deposit account with Bonner & Bonner on said respective dates, the same was merely a debt or credit with them, not liable to assessment in the county of Smith, but, if at all, in the county of Anderson, where it was alleged the principal office and domicile of the International & Great Northern Railway Company and of the receivers were; and which credits could only be assessed as to such sum as should appear as a balance, after deducting all liabilities as before set out. Wherefore, it was alleged the said assessment and the attempted collection of taxes was without authority of law and wholly void; and plaintiff prayed for an injunction restraining defendant and his successors in office from further interfering with the property of the International & Great Northern Railway Company in the hands of plaintiff as receiver on account of taxes, and commanding him to desist from further levies, and to release the property levied on and to restore it to the possession of plaintiff. Defendant excepted to the petition, that it was wholly insufficient to entitle the plaintiff to the relief for which he prayed. He also addressed special exceptions to the sufficiency of the petition, and his general demurrer and special exceptions sufficiently presented the questions raised. The principal question in the case is presented by the appellant’s first assignment of error, as follows: “The court erred in dissolving the injunction, because, under the special statutes set out in full in plaintiff’s trial amendment, the property or money upon which their tax is levied is exempt from taxation.” The incorporation of the International Railway Company by the Legislature of the State of Texas, by the Act of August 5, 1870, and the granting to that company of bonds of the State amounting to 810,000 a mile, and an exemption of its property from taxation for five years, as well as the Compromise Act of March 10, 1875, by which lands were substituted in place of the bonds, and an exemption of the property of the company from taxation for twenty-five years was made, is familiar history in the legislation of this State. By the Act of August 5, 1870, which was the charter of said company, the route over which the line of railway was to be constructed was designated; the usual charter powers and provisions were conferred and made; the bonds were granted, and the property of the company was exempted from taxation. Afterward the International Railway Company was consolidated with the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company. When the controversy about the bonds of the State to the International Railway was settled by the Compromise Act of 1875, the consolidation of the two companies had already taken place, and was recognized by said act. The act was entitled “An act for the relief of the International Railroad Company, now consolidated with the Houston & Great Northern Railroad Company, under the name of the International & Great Northern Railroad Company.” The preamble to said act recited the act of incorporation of the International Railway Company; the grant of the bonds of the State to said company by said act; that about two hundred miles of said railway had been constructed; and that said company had been consolidated with the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, It also referred to the questions that had arisen as to the legal liability of the State to deliver said bonds, and declared the purpose of the act to be that “ these questions should be definitely settled by a just and reasonable compromise.” Section 1 of the act is as follows: “ Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, that in full settlement of and satisfaction of all claims of the said The International Railroad Company and of the said The International & Great Northern Railroad Company against the State for bonds under the provisions of the ninth section of the aforesaid Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, there is hereby granted to the said last named company, its successors and assigns, twenty sections, of 640 acres each, of the unappropriated public lands of the State, for each mile of railroad which has been and which may hereafter be constructed pursuant to the authority conferred by the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870. And the said company, its successors and assigns, shall have the right to locate said lands as head-right certificates were formerly located, without being under obligations to locate alternate sections for the State; and the said lands, and the certificates issued therefor, are hereby exempted and released from all state, county, town, city, municipal, and other taxes for the period of twenty-five years from the date of the respective certificates issued therefor. And the said railroad company, and its successors, and its and their capital stock, rights, franchises, railroads, constructed and to be constructed pursuant to the Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, and this act, rolling stock, and all other property which now is or hereafter may be owned or possessed by said company or its successors in virtue of the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, is hereby exempted and released from all state, count)-, town, city, municipal, and other taxes for a period of twenty-five years from the 5th day of August, A. D. 1875, except county and municipal taxes in such counties, cities, and towns as have donated their bonds to aid in the construction of said railroad; but this exception shall not remain in force in favor of any county, city, or town which, having thus donated bonds, shall make default in the payment of either the interest or principal thereof: Provided, that this exemption from taxation shall not be construed to include or apply to the lands or railroads which at the time of the consolidation herein before recited belonged to the Houston & Great Northern Railroad Company, or which has since been or hereafter may be constructed or acquired under its charter: Provided, nothing in this act contained shall be so construed as to exempt from taxation any lands to-which the company may be entitled by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railroad Company, or the franchise, roadbed, rolling stock, or any property acquired or hereafter to be acquired by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railroad Company; and the lands granted by this-act shall not be sold to any other corporation, or to any person in trust for the use or benefit of said company: And provided further, that the State shall not be liable for any deficiency of the unappropriated public domain on which to locate said land certificates, nor shall any of such unlocated certificates ever constitute a claim against the State.” Section 2 provides for the issue of the land certificates by the Commissioner of the General Land Office for twenty sections “ for each mile of railway which has been heretofore constructed pursuant to the aforesaid Act of August 5, A. D. 1870.” Section 3 provides for the inspection of the railway in sections of ten miles constructed 11 as authorized by the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870.” Section 7 provides for the acceptance of the provisions of the act by the stockholders of the International & Great Northern Railway Company, and upon such acceptance, that after compliance therewith by the State, the said act “ shall be and constitute a full, final, and conclusive settlement of all the claims and demands of said company against the State for bonds under ninth section of the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870; and this act shall also be held to constitute an irrepealable contract and agreement between the State and the said company, its successors and assigns.” The consolidation of the International Railway Company with the Houston & Great Northern was authorized by section 14 of the Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, incorporating the International Railway Company, is recognized in the compromise act, and the benefits of the act are extended to the consolidated International & Great Northern Railway Company as to all rights and property acquired under the charter of the International Railway Company. It must be observed that the compromise act does not in any manner interfere with the charter of the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, and only “such parts of the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, entitled ‘An act to incorporate the International Railway Company, and to provide for the aid of the State of Texas in constructing the same,’ and all other laws inconsistent with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.” A clear distinction is made and observed between the two railways which were originally chartered by the Legislature, and the ownership of the consolidated company of its railway property is recognized by the Legislature as derived from two sources, namely, that “ which now is or hereafter may be owned or possessed by said company [International & Great Northern Railway Company] or its successors in virtue of the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870;” and the lands and railways ‘ ‘ which - at the time of the consolidation herein before recited belonged to the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, or which has since been or hereafter may be constructed or acquired under its charter;” also lands, franchise, roadbed, rolling stock, or any property “ acquired or hereafter to be acquired by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railway Company.” The original act of incorporation of the International Railway Company exempts from the payment of all taxes ‘ ‘ the capital stock and property of said company;” while the compromise act, after exempting from taxation the lands granted in lieu of the bonds, makes the following exemption: “And the said railway company and its successors, and its and their capital stock, rights, franchises, railways, constructed and to be constructed pursuant to the said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, and this act, rolling stock, and all other property which now is or hereafter may be owned or possessed by said company or its successors in virtue of said Act of August 5, A. D. 1870, is hereby exempted and released from all state, county, town, city, municipal, and other taxes for a period of twenty-five years, from the 5th day of August, A. D. 1875.” The exemption of “ said railway company and its successors,” and “ its and their capital stock,” etc., does not give any greater scope to the exemption than as to the property enumerated, for if such were the purpose it would be useless to enumerate the property that was to be exempted; and the property enumerated was such as belonged to the International & Great Northern Railway Company, acquired from the International Railway Company by reason of the consolidation of the two companies, which included the railway constructed or to be constructed pursuant to the charter of 1870. and the Compromise Act of 1875, as well as all other property then owned or possessed by the International Railway Company, or that might thereafter be owned or possessed by said company or its successors in virtue of the charter of International Railway Company. In order to leave no doubt as to what property should be exempted, the law, after expressing as plainly as it could, that it was to be only such property as the new company was entitled to by reason of its acquisition of the charter rights and privileges of the International Company, makes two provisos, in which it is expressly stated, first, that the exemption should not apply to the lands or railways which at the time of the consolidation belonged to the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, or that might since have been or might afterward be constructed or acquired by its charter; and second, after repeating that the lands to which the Great Northern Railway Company might be entitled should not be exempt, the law stated also that nothing in the act contained should be so construed as to exempt from taxation the franchise, roadbed, rolling stock, or any property acquired or thereafter to be acquired by virtue of the charter of said company. This was as it should be. The act was for the relief of the International Railway Company, and in view of the consolidation such relief should have been, and was, granted only so far as the right thereto existed under the charter of 1870 incorporating the International Railway Company. While the Legislature and the International & Great Northern Railway Company, as the successor of the International Railway Company, may have made the consideration for the release of the State from its obligation to issue its bonds manifest in some other manner, as by the exemption of all the property of the consolidated company, still the design is apparent to make it applicable as nearly as possible to the rights of the International Railway Company as they existed under its charter, and restrict the grant of lands to such railway as should be built along the route designated in the charter, and the exemption from taxation to the property the acquisition of which might be traced to the exercise of the franchise granted thereby. This was well expressed in the discussion of this act in the case of the International & Great Northern Railway Company v. Anderson County, 59 Texas, 661, by Judge Stay ton, in delivering the opinion of the court, in the following language: “ The act further evidences that the exemption from taxation of property belonging to the consolidated company was to be restricted narrowly and closely to such property as it held or might hold under the charter originally granted to the International Railway Company, and that the benefits otherwise to the consolidated company should be for and on account of acts which the International Railway Company had already performed under its charter, or such as the consolidated company might perform after the date of the act under that charter or the act now in consideration.” The assessment in this case was against money deposited by the receivers of the International & Great Northern Railway with Bonner & Bonner, bankers, in the city of Tyler. Money is property in a legal sense. At the time of the passage of the Compromise Act and now, the laws of this State, in providing for the rendition of property for taxes, mention money as property subject to taxation. 2 Pasch. Dig., art. 7713; Rev. Stats., arts. 4671, 4710. But the appellee has invoked for the construction of the word “ property,” as used in the act, the rule of noscitur a sociis, and contends that the meaning of the word in this instance must be ascertained by reference to the kind of property that is exempted in terms, and that the word as used in the act can apply only to property of a like character to that which is exempted by name, and that money is not exempted from taxation by a proper construction of the act. We do not deem it necessary, however, to determine whether we may resort to this construction in this instance or not, for the appellant has not by the allegations in his petition brought the property upon which the tax has been assessed within the exemption. His allegation is, 61 that all the money on which this tax is levied was money earned by the International & Great Northern Railway, and not acquired by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railway Company, or the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, and is therefore exempt from taxation under said special act,” which he sets out in full. This allegation may be very true; the money may have been earned by the operation of the International & Great Northern Railway of all its lines as a system, and not acquired by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railway Company, or the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, and still not be exempt. It is not shown that the money, or a part of it, was not earned by the operation of the line of railway constructed in accordance with the charter of the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, or the Great Northern Railway Company, by the International & Great Northern Railway Company. Such being the case, it is not necessary for us to decide whether or not the term u property,” as used in the act, would include money, and so exempt the deposits assessed for taxation. Nor is it necessary to consider whether or not the exemption from taxation applies only to property peculiar and necessary or convenient to the construction and operation of the railway constructed and to be constructed by virtue of the charter of the International Railway over the route designated in that charter; and upon this point the court expresses no opinion. Appellant’s second assignment of error is as follows: “ The court erred in dismissing the plaintiff’s petition, but should have held it over for a hearing on the merits, because said petition was sworn to, and showed that plaintiff was not liable for near all the taxes claimed by defendant and stated in the judgment, but for a much less amount only, if said property was not protected by said special exemption law; and defendant’s answer not being sworn to, the court should have heard proof of the amount of taxes actually due, as that was an issue made in the cause by the pleadings.” If the plaintiff’s petition failed to disclose a good cause of action, there was no error in sustaining the defendant’s exceptions thereto. In such event, the plaintiff having declined to amend, the proper practice would be to render judgment for the defendant, dismissing the plaintiff’s cause, as was done by the court. Such would be a trial on the merits. As we have already held that the petition did not allege facts sufficient to show that the money was exempt from taxation, the suit was properly dismissed, unless the court erred in some other respect as to the sufficiency of the facts to show a cause of action. The fact that the petition was. sworn to will not be claimed to give aid to the legal sufficiency of the allegations, if it should appear from the facts stated that plaintiff would not be entitled to have the valuation of the property reduced below the assessment as made. A demurrer would reach such defects in allegations,, although there might not be a sworn answer denying the facts. Appellant contends that the assessment should be reduced, because, first, the deposit was subject to setoff by the liabilities of the receivers; and in the second place, because the amount of the assessment was not in the hands of Bonner & Bonner in actual cash, although the deposit account showed more than that amount to the credit of the receivers. Facts were also stated showing that the Commissioners Court, sitting as a board of equalization, had fixed the amount of the assessment. Although a deposit subject to the sight check of the depositor is usually held to be nothing more than a debt against the bank, still it is regarded by the law of this State providing for the rendition of property for taxation as cash, and as such it is not subject to be offset by the liabilities of the tax payer Rev. Stats., arts. 4672, 4692(6). This can not be disproved by showing that as a matter of fact the bank did not have so much money in its vaults at the time, because sufficient funds of the bank may be on deposit in other banks to meet its draft for the entire amount, and under well known banking rules, a percentage of the deposits are usually loaned to customers; still, whenever the sight check of the depositor is presented, it must be paid, and in ordinary business affairs such deposits are treated as money; and the statute defines money as including 11 every deposit which any person owning the same or holding in trust, and residing in this State, is entitled to withdraw in money on demand.” Taking the statement as furnished by the plaintiff, it would seem that the board of equalization had allowed greater deductions than he was legally entitled to As it was not necessary for the defendant to furnish proof of the ■amount of taxes due, the same fully appearing from the facts stated in the plaintiff’s petition, there was no error on that ground, as set out in appellant’s third assignment of error, in rendering judgment requiring him to pay the taxes as the receiver appointed by the court for the property against which the tax had been assessed. The judgment of the court below will be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered December 15, 1892.","FIRST DISTRICT, DECEMBER, 1892. T. M. Campbell, Receiver, v. Ed. B. Wiggins, Tax Collector. No. 171. 1. Taxation of Money of the International <& Great Northern Railway Company.—Money earned by the International & Great Northern Railway, after the consolidation of the International witli the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, was deposited in hank, and assessed for taxes, and levy made to enforce the collection of the taxes thus assessed. The receiver having enjoined, and in his petition alleged that all the money (for the taxes assessed against which the levy was made) was earned by the International & Great Northern Railway Company, and not by virtue of the charter of the Great Northern Railway, or the Houston & Great Northern Railway Company, it is held, that such money is not exempted from taxation under the compromise Act of the Legislature of March 10, 1875, which by its terms specified the exemptions from taxation granted to, the consolidated -company. 2. Construction of the Compromise Act of March 10, 1875.— This act recognizes the consolidation of the International Railway Company with the Houston & Great Northern, and does not in any manner interfere with the charter of the latter road, hut a clear distinction is made and observed between the two roads, and the ownership by the consolidated road of its property is recognized by the Legislature to be derived from the two sources. 3. Same—The Tax Exemption.—The exemption of the consolidated road and its successors, and “ its capital stock, rights, franchises, etc.,” does not give any greater scope to the exemption than as to the property enumerated as exempt, for if such were the purpose, it would he useless to enumerate the property that was exempted. In order to leave no doubt as to what property should he exempted. the law, after expressing as plainly as it could that it was to he only such property as the new company was entitled to by reason of its acquisition of the charter, rights, and privileges of the International Company, expressly provides that the exemption should not apply to the lands of the Houston & Great Northern Railway, or to the franchise, road bed, rolling stock, or any property acquired or to be acquired by virtue of the charter of that company. 4. Money as Property under said Act.—Money is property subject to taxation, hut whether the word “ property” as used in the Act of March 10.1875. includes the money of the road or not, need not he decided, as appellant alleges that all the money on which this tax was levied was earned by the consolidated road, and it is not shown that the money, or a part of it, was not earned by the operations of the roads consolidated witli the International. 5. Injunction — Holding over Case for Trial on Merits. — If -the petition.failed to disclose a good cause of action, defendant’s exceptions were rightfully sustained; and the plaintiff having declined to amend, the proper practice was to render judgment for the defendant, dismissing plaintiff’s case. The fact that the plaintiff's petition was sworn to gives no aid to the legal sufficiency of its allegations. 6. Deposit not Liable to setoff by Liabilities of Tax Payer.— The receiver claimed that the amount of the - assessment was not in the hands of their bankers in actual cash when the assessment was made, and that they were entitled to offset their liabilities against it. Although a deposit subject to sight check is usually held to be nothing more than a debt against the bank, it is regarded by the tax law of this State as cash, and as such is not subject to be offset by the liabilities of the tax payer. 7. Same—Bankers’ Cash in Vault.—Proof that the bankers with whom the receiver had his deposit account did not have as much money on hand in their vaults as the amount of the deposit which was taxed, does not disprove that the tax payer has money on hand subject to taxation. The statute (Revised Statutes, article 4672) defines money as including “ every deposit which any person owning the same, or holding in trust, and residing in this State, is entitled to withdraw in money oil demand.” Appeal from Smith. Tried below before Hon. Felix J. McCord. J. M. Duncan and G. H. Gould, for appellant. 1. The court erred in dissolving the injunction, because, under the special statutes set out in full in plaintiff’s trial amendment, the property or money upon which their tax is levied is exempt from taxation.

"COLLARD, Associate Justcie. This is an action of trespass to try title, brought by Jesus Guerra, Trinidad Guerra, and others, as the only heirs of Dolores Hernandez, deceased, against Adolph Scholz, who, holding under a contract of lease from the city of San Antonio, caused it to be made a party defendant. Plaintiffs agreeing to adopt the contract of the city with him in case they should recover the property, he made no further defense. The original petition was filed August 31, 1885. The city answered not guilty, limitation, stale demand, and title by prescription under thirty years possession, and asked for compensation for improvements made in good faith. A jury was waived, and the court, after trying the cause, gave judgment for defendants, from which plaintiffs have appealed. Plaintiffs read in evidence an instrument in writing, of date the 15th of February, 1842, upon which their claim to the property is based, as the heirs of Dolores Hernandez. Said instrument is in the Spanish language, and as translated into the English language, reads as follows: “Republic of Texas, County of Bexar. — In the city of San Antonio, on the 15th day of the month of February of the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-two, before me, Juan Nepomaceno Seguin, president of the corporation of said city, personally appeared Dolores Hernandez, of this vicinity, who, I certify, is known to me, declared that by virtue of the destruction of the title of acquisition of the lot which she inherited from her deceased mother, in the confusion of the archives of this city in the capture of this place by the army of Texas, she presents as witnesses that they might declare under oath if they know whether her mother had a deed from the government of the ancient Province of Texas, and if they know whether any person had ever instituted suit against them to nullify the quiet, ancient, and legal possession which her predecessors held down to the interested lady of said land; and after having sworn the witnesses, Dn. Ignacio Tejada and Dn. Jose de la Garza, of this vicinity, according to the forms provided by law, they declared, that for many years they had known Dn. Martina Rios, living on the lot hereafter mentioned, that they have seen the title of possession in favor of said lady, extended by the Governor of the Province, Dn. Antonio Cordero, and that they have never seen or heard of any person instituting suit for the nullification of the quiet possession of the aforesaid land, which has been held by said lady down to the interested lady. And having proven that the part of the lot which belongs to Dn. Maria Dolores Hernandez has a front of twenty-one varas and depth to the river, bounded on the north by a lot of Dn. Candalaria Mansolo, on the west by the river of this city, on the south by lot of Dn. Juana Leal de Tarin, and on the east by the principal street running towards the muralla [rampart wall], and by virtue of the destruction of the original, in the epoch of which the interested lady has furnished a description, I extend the present that it may serve her as a protection in the meantime. I extend it to her in the same manner as to all Other persons who find themselves in the same condition as the present case, according to the disposition made by the corporation of this city on the second day of the current month. “ City of San Antonio, February 15th, 1842. “Juan N. Seguin, President of the Corporation. his “Jose de la X Garza.” mark. We also find that Hernandez, mentioned in the foregoing paper, died many years before the filing of this suit, and that plaintiffs are her only heirs. The land described in the foregoing instrument embraces the land described in plaintiffs’ petition. On the 21st day of January, 1875, the plaintiffs herein executed a deed to Ed. Steves to certain land in the city of San Antonio, described therein, in which the following statement is made: “ The present sale includes all houses, outhouses, other buildings, fences, and improvements actually existing on the premises, that have been inherited by the vendors from their deceased parents, Trinidad Guerra and Dolores Hernandez, who had inherited part of the same, and purchased the balance, as it appears from the different deeds of transfer, namely, from a deed delivered on the 15th of February, 1842, by the mayor of the city of San Antonio, said deed duly recorded in the county clerk’s office of Bexar County, in book S, No. 2, pages 279 and 280; from another deed of the 7tli day of May, 1858, delivered by Simon Ariola, through his attorney in fact.” The land conveyed by this deed is not in controversy. The defendants read in evidence other deeds, which we think are not important to our decision. In addition to the foregoing, it was agreed, and we find, that the lot in question was unenclosed up to the time that defendant Scholz took possession thereof; and that there was a spring south of, or at the south end of, said lot near the water’s edge, to which the public had access for many years before they were cut off from the use of same by the wall built by defendant Scholz, under his. contract with defendant the city of San Antonio. That the property now sued for was a steep bluff, running from the edge of the street to near the water’s edge, which, up to the entry by defendant Scholz, under his contract with the city of San Antonio, had never been used by any person except the public for going down to a spring of water near the water’s edge. That about 1873 the city, to prevent the street from caving toward the river, built a heavy stone wall between the street and water, leaving a small space between the wall and water and an entrance way to the spring, and thereafter the water in the river receded, leaving the space, together with the stone wall, sufficient for defendant Scholz’s buildings. The said wall built by the city being used as Scholz’s east wall. The appellants claim that the court erred in rendering judgment against the plaintiffs, because the city of San Antonio had acknowledged and confirmed the title of the plaintiffs to said property by the paper introduced in evidence, dated the 15tli day of February, 1842, signed by Juan N. Seguin, president of the corporation. This is the principal question to be considered. Plaintiffs rested their title and right to recover upon this instrument, having proved that they were the heirs of Dolores Hernandez. It is well settled in this State that the acts of an officer assuming to discharge an attribute of office are presumed to be within the scope of his authority, unless the contrary be shown. Jones v. Garza, 11 Texas, 205; Hancock v. McKinney, 7 Texas, 384; Jenkins v. Chambers, 9 Texas, 167; Wooters v. Hall, 61 Texas, 15. It may be conceded for appellants that the paper executed by Seguin, president of the corporation of the city of San Antonio, was executed by proper authority for whatever it may be worth, as there is nothing in the record to show that he had no such authority. We know of no law, and are cited to none, which grants to the mayor or president of any incorporated city or town the official function exercised by Seguin in the execution of the foregoing instrument. He may have had such power, however, by vote of the corporation, by ordinance, or by direction of the duly constituted city authorities. , The instrument discloses that it is extended to the interested party “in the same manner as to all other persons who find themselves in the same condition as the present case, according to the disposition made by the corporation of this city on the second day of the current month” — February, 1842; indicating that the power was granted by the corporation to perform the act as it was done. But the question is, What did this instrument mean ? To what did it entitle the interested party ? It does not disclose its object. It allowed her to make proof of the loss of her original grant by persons who had seen it, and after this proof was made, the paper was extended that it may “serve her as a protection in the meantime,” as to all other persons in the same condition. What protection was this ? How long did it last ? And was it to be followed by suit, or any other prescribed mode of establishing title ? To answer this, we must know what the corporation had done for such cases, what relief it granted, and on what conditions. The paper itself does not show it; it was not a deed, a relinquishment, or a grant of title. The most that its terms imply is that it was a temporary protection, but the character of protection is not stated. The common law was in force at the time, by statute of January 20, 1840, which would not construe the instrument into a conveyance, or an absolute and final recognition of title. What the intention and office of the instrument was could only be ascertained by the proceedings authorizing it, by the power conferred upon the officer taking the proof. It may have been a protection of possession until suit could be brought in the courts to establish title in the regular way; it may have been a protection in the use of houses and improvements for a'time; it may have been something else. It is useless to speculate about it. If it was intended as a guaranty of possession only of houses and improvements, these had been sold to Steves. The land in suit had never been enclosed or reduced to actual possession by plaintiffs. It must be presumed, in the absence of proof, that Hernandez and her heirs have already enjoyed to the fullest extent and exhausted the privileges granted them by the protection. At all events, we can not saj^ that the instrument was of such a character as would authorize a recovery in trespass to try title against any one — even the party granting it — since no claim thereunder has been asserted for many years. It purports to be only a temporary protection. Its language must be interpreted under the light of the common law, and only such meaning given to it as it actually signifies. If we had the acts of the corporation upon which the president acted, we might arrive at the intent and meaning of the instrument; without that we can not. Delivered November 1, 1892. Having failed to show title, plaintiffs could not recover. No other judgment could have been rendered by the court below, and it is affirmed. Affirmed. Motion for rehearing refused.","Trinidad Guerra et al. v. City of San Antonio. No. 23. 1. Authority of Officers Presumed. — It is well settled in this State that the acts of an officer assuming to discharge an attribute of his office are presumed to be within the scope of his authority unless the contrary be shown. 2. Construction of Instrument. — In 1842 Seguin, styling himself President of the Corporation of San Antonio, executed an instrument to Dolores Hernandez touching certain city property described therein, allowing her to make proof of the loss of her original grant, by persons who had seen it, and after such proof was made continuing: “I extend the present that it may serve helas á protection in the meantime. I extend it to her in the same manner as to all other persons who find themselves in the same condition as the present case, according to the disposition made by the corporation of this city on the 2d day of the current month.” What such disposition was is not shown. There were no granting words. Held, such instrument conveyed no title, and no recovery could be had under it in trespass to try title. Appeal from Bexar. Tried below before Hon. G. H. Noonan. L. N. Walthal, for appellants. The court erred in rendering judgment for the defendants and against the plaintiffs, because the plaintiffs proved a good and valid conveyance from the city of San Antonio, acting by its then mayor, Juan N. Seguin, to Dolores Hernandez, the ancestor of the plaintiffs, said conveyance dated 15th day of February, 1842; and there was no evidence showing or tending to show that the said Dolores Hernandez or these plaintiffs had ever parted with their title; and because the said city of San Antonio had acknowledged and confirmed the title of the plaintiffs to said property by the paper introduced in evidence, dated the 15th day of February, 1842, signed Juan N. Seguin, president of the corporation. Wooters v. Hall, 61 Texas, 15; Hardy v. De Leon, 5 Texas, 243; Jones v. Garza, 11 Texas, 207; Hancock v. McKinney, 7 Texas, 442, 443; Carver v.

Harder, 4 Johns., 202. Upson & Bergstrom, for appellee. The court did not err in rendering judgment for defendants, because appellants offered no evidence of title in themselves whatever, the instrument executed by Juan N. Seguin not being a conveyance or evidence of title; and as an admission of title by defendant, no authority is shown on the part of Juan N. Seguin to execute the instrument offered in evidence."
"HEAD, Associate Justice. Appellee is a municipal corporation, organized under the laws of the State of Texas, and adopted the following ordinance: 11 It shall be the duty of the marshal to cause the removal and burial, at the expense of the city, of all carcasses of dead animals, the owner or person in charge of which can not be ascertained.” In the month of February, 1888, the city marshal, in pursuance of this ordinance, had removed a large number of dead animals from one place in the city, where they had become offensive, to a point about 380 yards southeast of appellee’s house, where they became exceedingly offensive to appellee and his family, and could be smelled for a long distance even beyond appellee’s house. The marshal, upon several occasions after the first deposit, made other deposits of dead animals at the same place, which added somewhat to the offensive odor. Two attempts were made by the marshal to burn these carcasses, the first of which, being ineffectual, only added to the nuisance. These deposits were made at this place by permission of the agent of the owner of the land, who was also an alderman of the city, and who had previously tendered the land to the city council for this purpose, which ""was accepted by it. The agent, however, imposed as a condition that the animals should be burned or destroyed, and not buried thereon. Appellee made complaint of the nuisance before bringing his suit, both to the marshal and mayor of the city, and some of the deposits were made after these notices, and even after the filing of plaintiff’s petition. To recover for the damages sustained by himself and wife for the nuisance thus created and maintained by authority of the city, appellee instituted this suit, and recovered judgment in the sum of 8287.50, from which this appeal is prosecuted. Appellant’s first and second assignments of error complain of the action of the court in overruling its exceptions to plaintiff’s second amended original petition. We are of opinion that this assignment is not well baken. The petition, as we think, very clearly sets forth a cause of action against appellant, under repeated decisions of our Supreme Court. City of Fort Worth v. Crawford, 74 Texas, 404; City of Fort Worth v. Crawford, 64 Texas, 202; Langham v. City of Sherman, 13 S. W. Rep., 1042. Appellant’s fourth assignment of error is as follows: 1 ‘ The court erred in instructing the jury in the'first part of the court’s charge as follows: 1 If you believe from the evidence that the defendant, by an ordinance passed by the council of defendant, duly and legally assembled as such, ordered the city marshal to remove the bodies of dead animals beyond the limits of the city, and shall further believe that the city marshal, acting under such ordinance, for the purpose of promoting and protecting the sanitary condition of said city, wrongfully and negligently caused the carcasses of dead animals to be removed beyond the limits of said city and placed so near the house of said plaintiff as to create a stench, which injured and damaged plaintiff as alleged in the petition, then you will find for the plaintiff as damages such sum as you may under the evidence believe plaintiff entitled to recover, not to exceed the sum of $2000, and so say by your verdict.’ This part of the charge is vague, wrong, and indefinite, and calculated to mislead the jury; for, according to the allegations in plaintiff’s petition, the damage to plaintiff, if any, arose from the carcasses alleged to have been deposited at a designated point southeast of plaintiff’s house, the city ordinance introduced in evidence forbidding such deposit within 400 yards of a private house. But under the charge of the court the jury might find a verdict for plaintiff on account of any other offensive deposits made or caused to be made by defendant’s officers or agents near the house, even though in violation of the city ordinances; nor is this feature remedied in any other portion of the charge. Under such a charge, also, the jury might find against defendant if private parties hauled carcasses there in violation of the city ordinances, provided especially if the jury believe them influenced in so doing by the acts or words of any officer, agent, or servant of the city; 'Or the jury might find against the defendant even though they believe the acts charged to have been done by a police officer or other officer for whose acts, under such an ordinance, the defendant would not be liable, and that though the city council had no notice of the acts, and though the marshal or other officer was acting under a general ordinance of the city, which left the manner of the performance of his duty under it to his own discretion, as seems to appear from the evidence in this cause, and not under an ordinance which made it compulsory upon him to do the acts in the manner, time, and place as charged in the petition.” We think a careful reading of the charge quoted in this assignment will show that it is not subject to any of the valid objections made to it in the argument also contained in the assignment. The objection that the charge authorized a recovery for the nuisance caused by carcasses placed near the house of appellee, but not in an exact southeastern direction therefrom, we regard as hypercritical. We do not understand the averment as to the direction the carcasses were deposited from appellee’s house as necessary to be proven with the exactness indicated by the opinion of counsel as disclosed in this assignment. Also, we do not think the charge subject to the objection that it authorized a recovery for damage caused by carcasses deposited by others than the marshal acting under an ordinance of the city. We are also of opinion that if the city, by its ordinance, left the place and manner of depositing to the marshal, it would be responsible for a negligent performance of the duties thus conferred upon him. The ordinance of the city which appellant complains of as having prohibited the deposit in less than 400 yards of any private residence relates entirely to the acts of private parties, and isas follows: “ It shall not be lawful for any person or persons in this city to allow or permit any horse or other animal owned or controlled or kept by him, her, or them, and which has come to its death by disease or otherwise, to lie or remain upon any street, alley, square, or other ground, public or private, but such person or persons shall cause the carcasses of such animal or animals to be securely buried or taken outside the corporate limits of this city and deposited not less than 400 yards from any private-residence.” It will thus be seen that while private parties were prohibited from making such deposits in a less distance than 400 yards of private residences, there was no limit placed upon the power of the city and its officers in this respect by the ordinance quoted in the conclusions of fact. Appellant’s sixth assignment of error complains of the action of the court in refusing to give a special charge requested by it, to the effect that appellant could not be held liable for the alleged ratification of the acts of others without a full knowledge of the facts in the premises. An examination of the court’s charge will show that the question of ratification was not submitted to the jury at all, and under the charge as given, the jury were only authorized to find in favor of appellee in case they found that appellant was guilty of negligence in the first instance in causing the nuisance. Under these circumstances, we are of opinion that no injury could have resulted to appellant from the refusal to give this requested charge, even though there may have been evidence on the subject of ratification by it. Defendant may have been liable upon two grounds, yet only one ground of liability was submitted to the jury, and they were carefully instructed not to find against appellant unless they found the facts creating the liability upon this ground. Appellant’s seventh assignment of error complains of the action of the court in refusing to give a special charge requested by it, to the effect that it was incumbent upon plaintiff to prove negligence on the part of the city of Hillsboro. As indicated above, we are of opinion that if the city council by ordinance confided the manner of performance of this duty to the city marshal, it would be responsible for his negligent performance of such duty, and this phase of negligence was repeatedly submitted to the jury in the charge given by the court. Delivered December 20, 1892. What we have already said sufficiently shows that we are of opinion that the court did not err in overruling appellant’s motion for a new trial, as complained of in its eighth and tenth assignments of error. Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed.","The City of Hillsboro v. R. F. Ivey. No. 56. 1. Municipal Corporation — Liability for Nuisance. —A city ordinance provided that. “ It shall be the duty of the marshal to cause the removal and burial, at the expense of the city, of all carcasses of dead animals the owner or person in charge of which can not be ascertained.” JECeH, that this confided the manner of the performance of this duty to the marshal, and the city would be responsible in damages for his negligent performance thereof in depositing such carcasses so near a private residence as to create a nuisance thereby. 2. Same — Charge of Court. — See the opinion for a charge of court held to correctly submit to the jury the liability of a municipal corporation in damages for a nuisance caused by its city marshal depositing dead animals near a residence. 3. Special Charge Correctly Befused, when. — Where the court had not charged at all as to the liability of the defendant city on the ground that it had ratified the acts of its agent, it was not error to refuse an instruction asked by defendant limiting the doctrine of ratification. Appeal from Hill. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. G. T. Jones and D. Derden, for appellant. 1. Plaintiff’s petition failed to show a cause of action.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Appellant was the owner of about 10 acres of land within the corporate limits of the city of Gainesville, and in March, 1887, conveyed five-eighths of an acre to J. M. Lindsay by warranty deed, and received a valuable consideration therefor. This deed called for the south line of appellant’s tract, and made no allusion to there being a road or street along this line. This land was conveyed to Lindsay for the use of appellee, and was afterwards conveyed by him to it. Appellee established its yards, round houses, and shops upon this land and land acquired by it from other parties adjoining and south thereof, and erected what is termed its sand house on the south line of the tract so conveyed by appellant, and in such position that it would obstruct the road or street, if such there was, along this line. Appellant instituted this suit,, alleging, that a public road or street had existed along the south line of the land so conveyed by him for a number of years, and that by reason of the obstruction of said street by appellee, he had been damaged by a ■diminution in the rental value oí some houses owned by him near such obstruction. Appellee answered, denying the existence of such public road or street; and also pleaded estoppel against appellant by reason of his conveyance aforesaid. Upon the question as to whether or not there was such road or street, the court gave the following instruction to the jury: “To constitute a public highway outside the corporate limits of a town or city, it is necessary that it should have been used by the public as such and recognized as such by the public officials or tribunals of the county through which it runs, having charge of the public roads, by some official act, such as by designating it upon the official records as such, assigning hands to work it, making appropriations for its improvement, or such other acts indicating an acceptance of it as a public highway; and in order to constitute a public highway within the corporate limits of a town or city, it is necessary that it should have been used as such and accepted as such by the city council, by some act assuming control over it, and sufficient, in the opinion of the jury, to establish that it was accepted and recognized by such town or city as a public highway.” If this were a suit to render the municipality liable for negligence in failing to repair the highway, the definition given by the court would perhaps be unobjectionable, but we are of opinion that it is too restricted when the evidence raises the issue as to whether or not a highway had been dedicated to the public and accepted by it, so as to prohibit the revocation of such dedication. It has been frequently said in this State-, that to render the municipality liable for a failure to repair a highway dedicated to the public, it is necessary that it should be accepted by the municipal authorities, no person having the right to impose this burden upon the public without their consent. Gilder v. The City of Brenham, 67 Texas, 345. And there are expressions in several cases which might be construed as holding that an acceptance by such authorities would be necessary to constitute a public road or street for any purpose.

But we do not understand any of these cases to go to the extent of holding that a highway which has been dedicated to the public may not be accepted in its behalf in other ways than by affirmative action on the part of the municipal authorities, and we understand several of them to indicate quite the contrary view. In Worthington v. Wade, supra, it is said: “A road not originally established under the statute may become public by long continued use and adoption as such by the county commissioners, with the assent of the owner or by prescription. A road may also become public, in the sense that the public have the right to use it by dedication. * * * No act of any owner was proven which tended to show an intent to dedicate it to the use of the public. In this State, the mere acquiescence of the owner of -unenclosed land in the use by the public of a road over it is not sufficient evidence of a dedication.” And in Ramthun v. Halfman, 58 Texas, 553, it is said: “A highway may be created by a dedication or donation by the owner of his lands for that purpose, when such dedication has been accepted or recognized as a highway by the proper public authorities, or v)hen the same has been accepted and used as such by the public.” Also, see Railway v. Lee, 70 Texas, 496; Oswald v. Grenet, 22 Texas, 94. The authorities outside of this State, as to what is necessary to constitute an acceptance of a highway dedicated to the public, are not at all in harmony; but Mr. Elliott, in his work on Roads and Streets, page 117, says, “ This uncertainty is removed by the later authorities, and it may now be considered as the prevailing opinion, that an acceptance may be implied from a general or long continued use by the public as of right;” to sustain which he cites a great number of cases which seem to support his conplusion. In this case, we are of opinion that there was some evidence which raised the issue as to whether or not this road had been dedicated to the public by the owners of the adjoining land prior to the conveyance by appellant; and we are of opinion that the charge of the court was too restricted, in requiring an acceptance of such dedication to have been evidenced by some affirmative act on the part of the county or city authorities. The charge clearly conveyed to the jury the idea, that there could be no public highway without such action upon the part of the Commissioners Court or the city council, and we think this was error. The court also gave the following instruction to the jury: “If you find that at the time the plaintiff conveyed to J. M. Lindsay for the railroad the five-eighths of an acre described in the deed from Lindsay to defendant which has been introduced in evidence before you, the plaintiff knew the purpose for which the railroad intended to use said land, and knew that such use would result in the obstruction of said road, then you will find for the defendant, even though you should believe that such road was a public highway; but unless plaintiff knew the purpose for which defendant intended to use said'land, and knew that such use would obstruct the way, he will not be prevented from claiming damages.” We think this charge very clearly states the law applicable to this branch of the case. Appellee contends, that appellant by his deed would be estopped, even without the knowledge on his part required by this charge, and that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed for this reason, regardless of all other questions; but we can not agree with it in this construction of the deed. A deed to land fronting upon a public highway ordinarily conveys to the grantee the land to the middle of the road, subject to the easement; and we think it will be found, that by far the greater number of these deeds, in describing the land conveyed, call for the line of the owner without, perhaps, in any way alluding to the highway; and in such cases we are not prepared to hold, that the grantor would by his deed be estopped from denying the right of his grantee to close the highway. Wooldridge v. Eastland County, 70 Texas, 680; Day v. Chambers, 62 Texas, 190; Mitchell v. Bass, 26 Texas, 372. But in such cases, if, in addition to his deed, the grantor knows that the purchaser is acquiring the land under the impression that there is no highway, and with the intention of appropriating it to a use inconsistent with the existence of such highway, and with such knowledge receives and appropriates the purchase money for the land, he would be estopped to deny the right of Ms grantee to use it for such purpose. It seems to be well settled, that evidence of general reputation is admissible on the question as to whether or not a highway is public or private. 1 Greenl. on Ev., secs. 128, 140; Noyes v. Ward, 19 Conn., 269, which is approved in Cox v. The State, 41 Texas, 4. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether or not the evidence of appellee’s witnesses complained of by appellant was strictly admissible upon this ground or not, as it will hardly be presented in the same form upon another trial. We see no objection to the county judge testifying as to whether or not this highway was recognized as a public road by the court over which he presided. For the error in the charge of the court first above indicated, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 23, 1893.","Franz Albert v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company. No. 119. 1. Public Highway — Dedication — Acceptance by the Public.— Where the issue is as to whether a highway hacl been dedicated to the public and accepted by it so as to prohibit the revocation of such dedication, an instruction that in order to constitute a public highway outside of a city or town, it is necessary that it should have been recognized as such by the public officials or tribunals of the county through which it runs having charge of the public roads, by some official act, such as designating it upon the official records as such, assigning hands to work it, etc., is too restricted, since there may be an acceptance on behalf of the public in other ways than by affirmative action on the part of the public authorities. 2. Same.—So, an instruction requiring such affirmative acts of acceptance on the part of the municipal authorities in order to constitute a public street by dedication in a city or town, is also erroneous for the same reason. 3. Same—Estoppel by Deed.—Where the owner of land having thereon a highway by dedication conveys the entire tract, without allusion to the highway, to one who is ignorant of the dedication, knowing that the grantee intends to build on the part so dedicated, he will be estopped to claim damages of the grantee for obstructing the highway by such building; but the deed will not so estop him unless he had knowledge of the grantee’s intention to build on the dedicated part. 4. Evidence—General Reputation as to Character of Highway. Evidence of general reputation is admissible on the question as to whether a highway is public or private. 5. Evidence of County Judge.—A county judge may testify as to whether a highway by dedication has been recognized as a public road by the Commissioners Court over which he presides. Appeal from Cooke. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Bell & Green, for appellant. 1. The power given the authorities to lay out and establish, change, and discontinue roads and public highways does not negative the existence of other roads otherwise established. The extent of the use of a road determines its character as public or not as a fact. Even where there is no acceptance on the part of the public authorities of a road, it will be regarded as a road, and kept open for the benefit of those who have purchased lots or built houses with reference to the location of the same. Railway v. Lee, 70 Texas, 496; 1 W. & W. C. C., secs. 81, 863; 2 Willson’s C. C., sec. 204; Washb. on Eas. and Serv., sec. 108. 2. The doctrine of estoppel in pais does not extend so far as to enable a person or corporation to do in effect what is forbidden by law, or what they are otherwise incapable of doing. It therefore follows, that if the way in question belonged to the public, the defendant, with or without the contract made with plaintiff by Lindsay, was forbidden by law to obstruct said highway. 6 Wait’s Act. and Def., 691, 684, 694; 14 N.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. Suit by Shumate, the appellee, against the appellant, for damages for failure to transmit and deliver the following telegram: “ G-atesville, November 30, 1887. “Mr. G. F. Johnson, Oceanside, Gal.: “ Close the trade. I will come soon. “ G-. M. Shumate.” Plaintiff paid the full charge for the message through to Oceanside. The line of the Western Union extended to San Bernardino, California, and no further in the direction of Oceanside. From San Bernardino the company relied upon the California Southern Eailway Company for transmission of messages to Oceanside, over its private lines. The message in question, was sent to San Bernardino by defendant, and was delivered to the California Southern Eailway Company to be forwarded to Oceanside. It was not delivered to Johnson at Oceanside, and the trade was not closed, as directed by Shumate. Shumate resided in Coryell County, Texas, and in November, 1887, he received a letter from G-. F. Johnson, at Oceanside, with a request to join him in a lease and purchase of land near Oceanside, and the telegram to Johnson was a reply to the letter. Shumate testified, that at the time he delivered the message to defendant’s agent at G-atesville, he (Shumate) told him that unless it went through all right, it would crush him or break him up, and Tillman, the agent, assured him it would go through all right. Plaintiff moved with his family from G-atesville to Oceanside, going by rail, but when he arrived at Oceanside he learned that the trade had not been made because his message had not been-delivered, and the owner of the property had made other arrangements. Shumate then returned with his family to Gatesville, Texas. Plaintiff in his petition claimed damages for loss occasioned by the failure to make the trade; loss by selling off some of his effects in Texas at a sacrifice, preparatory to leaving; expenses in going to and returning with his family from Oceanside. The court below sustained defendant’s exceptions to the item of damage for loss from failure to close the trade of lease and purchase of property at Oceanside, and overruled exceptions to alleged damages by sacrifice by sale of effects in Texas, and expenses going to California and returning. The trial before the court resulted in a judgment for plaintiff for §375, from which defendant has appealed. The first error assigned is the action of the court in overruling the exception to the item of damage alleged by sale of property at a sacrifice. Evidence was offered sustaining the item, and it evidently entered into the amount of damages for which judgment was rendered. This assignment of error is well taken. The damages claimed are too remote, and could not have entered into the contemplation of the parties at the time the telegram was received. Plaintiff was not bound to sell his property, and defendant would not be responsible for the price it brought. The second assignment is to the effect, that the court should have sustained the exception to the claim in the petition of compensation for expenses incurred by plaintiff in going to and from California with his family. In our opinion, the relation of these expenses to a breach of the obliligation on the part of the defendant is such as to constitute them legitimate damages. They proceed directly from the breach, and are the natural consequences flowing from it. To avail himself of the lease and acquisition of the property in California, plaintiff had to move with Ms family to Oceanside; his moving there with his family was a necessary incident of the trade referred to in the dispatch, a consequence for which defendant would be liable upon failure to transmit and deliver the message. 3 Suth. on Dam., 298, et seq. But appellant insists, that by the terms of the contract it was exempt from damages except for failure of performance on its own line, and that as the evidence shows no such failure, it would not be liable. Plaintiff’s testimony showed that the .telegram was written on a letterhead of Schley Bros. & Co., and not upon the forms of the company, and that after he returned from California, defendant’s agent gave him the original to copy, and at this time it was not attached to one of defendant’s blank contracts. Defendant’s agent testified, that when he received the telegram, he at the time attached it to the blank contract, and that he was not authorized to receive or send a message unless on such blank. The testimony justified the court in finding that the blank form was not attached to the message at the time it was received by the agent. It is, therefore, not necessary for us to decide whether there was in the blank such stipulations as would exempt the company from liability for the default of the connecting line from San Bernardino to Oceanside, the court below having decided (as we presume in favor of the judgment he did) that it was not a part of the contract. The testimony, we think, is sufficient to sustain the finding. The defendant having received full pay for the transmission of the message through to Oceanside, without a contract limiting its liability to its own line, was bound to send the message to its destination and deliver it. Railway v. Baird, 75 Texas, 256. We do not hold that the stipulations in the contract attached to the message would or would not absolve the company from liability according to the conditions stated. We do not enter into these questions, the judgment of the court below being supported by the conclusion that such stipulations were not a part of the contract. This disposes of appellant’s assignments of error. Appellee having presented none, there are no other questions before us. Because of the error of the court in allowing plaintiff to predicate a part of his damages upon the sale of his property at a sacrifice, the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 8, 1893.","Western Union Telegraph Company v. G. M. Shumate. No. 84. 1. Telegram—Damages too Remote.—S., at Gatesville,Texas, delivered for transmission to Oceanside, California, the following message: “Close the trade. I will come soon.” To the officer in charge at Gatesville it was explained that the message related to the lease and purchase of land near Oceanville. The message was not delivered, and the trade failed. S. sold his personal effects at a sacrifice at Gatesville and went to Oceanville. The journey was useless, and he returned. In suit against the telegraph company for damages for nondelivery of the message, held: 1. That the loss from the sale of personal effects could not he considered as contempleted by the parties. 2. The journey to California and its expenses, however, could be regarded as in contemplation, and the expenses of the journey were properly chargeable as damages. 2. Liability of Telegraph Company Beyond its Lines.—A telegraph company receiving a dispatch to a point beyond its own lines, and taking pay for sending the full distance and without any limitation of liability, is bound to .send the message to its destination and deliver it. Appeal from Coryell. Tried below before Hon. C. K. Bell. Stemmons & Field, for appellant. 1.

The court erred in overruling the exception to the item of damages, $250 expenses of plaintiff and family to Oceanside, California, and $250 expenses of plaintiff and family in returning from Oceanside to Gatesville, because such an item of damages can not be recovered in this action. If such an item can be recovered, it would be plaintiff alone under the wording of the message. Tel. Co. v. Kirkpatrick, 76 Texas, 217; Daniel v. Tel. Co., 61 Texas, 452. 3. The court erred in finding any judgment for plaintiff, because defendant had speedily and correctly transmitted the message and delivered it to the connecting line, and the failure was on the connecting line.

The message on its face indicates, first, a pecuniary business transaction, and second, a trip and the necessary expenses attending it from Texas to California. This, in connection with the statement made by appellee Shumate at the time he delivered appellant the message for transmission, was sufficient to bring the item of damage for the transportation of appellee and his family, baggage, etc., and the sacrifice and sale of his household effects, as damages-in contemplation of the parties that might proximately flow from a breach of the contract. 6 Wait’s Act and Def., p. 15, sec. 15; De Rutte v.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On January 22, 1887, A. D. Johnson, while in the discharge of his duty as brakeman for the appellant, was killed by the derailment of the car upon which he was riding, caused by a defective stock gap in appellant’s track between Cleburne and Alvarado, in Johnson County. At the time of his death the said Johnson was 29 years old and in good health; was a man of good morals, industrious and attentive to his business, and had a life-expectancy of 36.03 years. He had been working for himself ever since he was 18 years old, but had accumulated no property, everything he made going to the support of his family. At the time of his death he had been in the employ of appellant as brakeman for about four years, and was earning either $60 or $65 per month. He had been married eight years to appellee M. S. Johnson, and had one child, the appellee Murdie Lea Johnson, a boy, aged 2 years at the time of the death of his father as aforesaid. Upon one occasion during his employment with appellant the said A. D. Johnson had been employed as passenger conductor on one of its trains for one or two trips, and upon one trip had acted as baggage master. He does not seem to have been a man of any special education or business qualification, but was a good average brakeman. The verdict was in favor of appellees for $18,000, to be divided equally between them. The verdict established ordinary negligence on the part of appellant, and in this respect was well supported by the evidence. We have examined the record in this case with much care, and have been forced to the conclusion that the verdict for $18,000 is excessive and should be reversed. We realize the difficulty that necessarily attends the assessing of the amount of damage to be allowed in this class of cases, and for this reason the verdict of the jury should be entitled to more than ordinary weight. At the same time the law allows such damage to be estimated only upon the basis of pecuniary compensation, and demands that all considerations of sympathy and passion be excluded. It is true in arriving at this pecuniary compensation, in many cases there is much to be taken into consideration beside the actual money contributed by the deceased to those entitled to sue. The circumstances in many cases will justify a finding that, had not death prevented, promotion in his line of business, with increased earnings, would have resulted in increased contributions by deceased to those dependent upon him, and in such cases the jury would be authorized to take this into consideration in arriving at the amount of their verdict. In other cases the evidence may show that deceased was in the habit of rendering to those claiming damages for his death other valuable services beside contributions in money, and in such cases the probabilities as to this being continued in future, had not death resulted, could be weighed by the jury. A husband might and usually does render to the wife much valuable aid outside of his earnings in money, of which she is deprived by his death; and the jury, should it see proper, has the right to compensate her for this loss according to the circumstances of the particular case. A child, and especially a very young boy, is deprived of much that would be of value to him by the death of a father who, had he lived, would have contributed to his comfort, assistance, education, and training in many ways in addition to the actual money he would have furnished, and should a jury give reasonable compensation for this loss no just complaint could be made. 3 Wood's Ry. Law, 1539, 1540; Pierce on Rys., 397-399. But in all these cases the jury must be reasonable. They must not allow their sympathy or passion to carry them beyond the pecuniary compensation allowed by law. In the case before us the jury has allowed each of the appellees a sum of money which, at the current rate of interest, would annually yield a sum considerably in excess of the total wages deceased was earning at the time of his death. That each of them could not expect to receive the full amount of his earnings is plain from the evidence, both being entirely dependent thereon. In fact, both together could not expect to receive all of such earnings, because the evidence shows that the deceased had no property, and it was necessary for his own maintenance to be taken from his wages. It will thus be seen that the jury in fixing the compensation to be allowed appellees have estimated the incidental services deceased may have been expected to render his wife and child at a sum very greatly in excess of the assistance he was able to render them through his regular employment, and without deciding that this might not be- justified in some cases, we can find nothing in the record to sustain their conclusions as applied to this case. Deceased is not shown to have been possessed of any special qualifications to make his prospects of promotion peculiarly bright and rapid, or his incidental services more than ordinarily valuable, and we can not sustain a verdict which in effect finds that the services an ordinary brakeman renders his wife and child during the brief intervals he is able to be with them from his work is of so much greater pecuniary value to them than the amount he earns in his regular employment, even when we take into consideration the usual chances of promotion. The amount given the child Murdie Lea Johnson by the verdict in this case, if kept at interest at the current rate, would produce a sum sufficient to support and educate him in the very best schools during his minority and at his majority start him in business with a fortune of at least $10,000; a result, we feel constrained to hold, he could not have reasonably anticipated had his father lived. The court in several paragraphs of the charge to the jury used expressions which if standing alone might have been construed as requiring appellant to furnish a safe roadbed and track for the use of its employes. It is well settled in this State that ordinary care in this respect is all that is required of the master for the protection of his servants, and the use of the word “ safe” in this connection has been several times condemned by our Supreme Court. Railway v. Williams, 82 Texas, 343; Railway v. Wells, 81 Texas, 685. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether the whole charge taken together in this case was objectionable in this respect or not, and we only call attention to it in view of another trial. Appellant earnestly contends, that if the death of Johnson was caused by one of its cattle guards being out of repair, and this was the fault of its employes, it would only be liable for gross negligence, the death having occurred prior to the amendment of our statute upon this subject. The court, however, tried the case upon the theory that ordinary negligence would render appellant liable, and with this view of the law we fully concur. There are certain duties devolved upon the master as a personal obligation for which he is held responsible, although they are in fact performed bjr his employes, and it is well settled in this State that the duty of the master in reference to the roadbed and track he furnishes his employes to pass over is of this class. Railway v. Dunham, 49 Texas, 189; Railway v. Geiger, 79 Texas, 22. And when negligence in respect of one of these duties is the cause of the death it will be considered as having been caused by the act of the master himself, and not by the act of his servant or agent within the meaning of our statute. The last case cited above is directly in point. Delivered October 25, 1892. Let the judgment below be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial on account of the excessive verdict. Reversed and remanded.","Gulf Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. M. S. Johnson et al. No. 4. 1.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. This is the second appeal prosecuted by the defendant in this case from the judgment of the lower court. The decision upon the former appeal is reported in 63 Texas, 274-286. The appellee has upon this appeal also assigned error, which he asks to be considered, in case the appeal by the defendant be sustained. The first assignment of error is to the judgment sustaining the plaintiff’s exceptions to the defendant’s plea to the jurisdiction of the court, but as the transcript does not contain the exceptions to the plea, we are unable to determine whether there be error or not in the judgment sustaining the exceptions. Under such circumstances we must presume that the exceptions were correctly sustained. Every intendment is in favor of the ruling of the court. The second and third assignments impugn the action of the court in permitting the plaintiff, over defendant’s objection, to read in evidence from a statement of the facts, made up by the attorneys and approved by the judge, upon the former appeal of this case, what purported to be the testimony of the deceased witnesses Jefferson Bassett and George B. Robertson. The plaintiff having proved the death of these witnesses, and having next proved by counsel for the defendant that the testimony of these witnesses, given on the former trial, was, in substance, the same as that found in the statement of facts, the court, over the objection of the defendant, that the testimony of a deceased witness can not be reproduced by reading from a statement of facts, agreed to and approved by the judge-presiding, for the purposes of an appeal, permitted the plaintiff to read the testimony, and in this we think there was no error. Whart. Ev., secs. 177, 24; Davis v. Klein, 9 S. W. Rep., 724, 725. In the case cited by counsel for appellant in support of his objections to the testimony, the case of Dwyer v. Rippetoe, 72 Texas, 522, 523, there was no proof of the correctness of the statement of facts from which it was proposed to read the testimony of a deceased witness. Neither the counsel for plaintiff or defendant, nor the judge who tried the case, could say that the testimony of the deceased witness was correctly reported in the statement of facts from which counsel proposed to read. ■ The court, we think, committed an error in admitting in evidence, over the objection of appellant, that portion of the testimony of the witness Bassett in which the witness relates a conversation between himself and his cashier, relative to the amount of money paid to witness by defendant, such conversation having been had several hours after the payment had been made, and at a time when the defendant was not present; such testimony, we think, is clearly hearsay, and should not have been admitted. We know of no rule of law under which this conversation could be held to be evidence in this case. The position of counsel for appellee, that the conversation was a part of the res geste, and therefore legitimate, is not, in our opinion, tenable. The conversation between the witnesses Bassett and Robertson, had in the afternoon, consisted of declarations by the former, “ narrative” of what occurred in the morning when the money was paid him by the defendant, and questions put and suggestions made to him by Robertson. No part of this conversation, as we think, can be said to be a declaration evoked by and explanatory of the transaction had by the witness Bassett with the defendant, and therefore can not be any part of the res gestee. We are not able to say that this conversation did not have weight with the jury. What weight this testimony may have had we know not, and the case must therefore be reversed and remanded. The objection of the appellant to the charge of the court which explains to the jury what is meant by the expression “ weight of evidence,” is not good, in our judgment. The explanation of the term is correct, and we can not say that the instruction should not have been given. The appellant’s sixth and last assignment of error we do not care to discuss. Upon the trial of this cause, the plaintiff’s counsel, having previously interrogated the defendant as to the payment of money made by him to H. C. McIntyre, Jr., about the first of October, 1883, the day preceding the transaction with the plaintiff, and a payment made by him to N. E. Dever, the sheriff of Washington County, in December, 1884, proposed to prove by these witnesses the following facts: By witness McIntyre, that the defendant was indebted to the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company on a bill of freight amounting to about $200, and that defendant came into the office of witness, he being the agent for the railway, and placed upon witness’ desk a roll of money, which defendant averred contained $200, but which, in fact, contained only $180; that witness discovered the shortage after the defendant had left the office, but before he had finished taking his freight from the depot, and witness immediately called on the defendant and demanded that he make good the shortage, which defendant did after some hesitation. Several persons were present when this occurred, and in their presence the witness counted the money; that witness was busy at the time the roll of money was placed with him by defendant, and defendant was also in a hurry in making the payment and hauling off his freight. By the witness Dever, that in December, 1884, in making payment of a lot of goods sold to him by witness at attachment sale, the purchase amounting to over $2000, defendant tendered to witness four packages of money which he represented to con-1500 each; said tender was made late in the evening, and at a time when witness was very busy winding up the sales and other transactions of the day, and matters were in some confusion. Upon counting up the bills in said packages, one of them was found to contain only $380, to-wit, 38 bills of $10 each. The other three packages contained each $500. Upon witness calling defendant’s attention to the fact that there was a deficit of $120 in one of the packages, he stated in explanation that one of his boys had taken out of the package some money to pay for some cotton, and that he (defendant) had forgotten the circumstance. This evidence, when offered by plaintiff, was objected to by defendant, on the ground that the same was incompetent and irrevelant, and not proper matter of cross-examination or impeachment, and the objections were sustained and all of the evidence excluded, to which ruling of the court the plaintiff excepted, and upon appeal assigns the exclusion of this evidence as error. Delivered December 1, 1892. The object of plaintiff’s suit is not only to recover the alleged balance due plaintiff from defendant, but also to recover exemplary damages for the alleged fraud and deceit practiced upon plaintiff by defendant; and to sustain the charge of fraud, plaintiff must not only show by a preponderance of evidence that the roll of notes delivered to him contained less money than the defendant represented it to contain, but it must be further proved that defendant knew his representation so made to plaintiff to be false, and that it was made for the purpose of deceiving and defrauding the plaintiff. While the excluded evidence was not admissible to show that the roll contained less than $1000, if this fact be established by other evidence then the excluded evidence would be admissible as tending to show that defendant knew that to be a fact when he delivered the roll, and falsely represented it to contain $1000. We think the rule is well established, that when scienter and motive are involved, it is competent to show the commission of a series of similar acts by the defendant who is charged with guilty knowledge or fraudulent intent. The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and the cause remanded for another trial, in accordance with the rules of law enunciated in this opinion. JReversed and remanded. Justice Garrett did not sit in this case.","FIRST DISTRICT, DECEMBER, 1892. Thomas Dwyer v. B. H. Bassett, Surviving Partner. No. 39. 1. Evidence of Deceased Witness. — The evidence of a deceased witness may be reproduced, by reading it from a statement of facts, agreed to and approved by the presiding judge, if the party offering it proves the death of the witness since the former trial of the case, and proves further, that the testimony given by the witness upon the former trial was in substance the same as that found in the statement of facts. 2. Case Qualified. — In the case of Dwyer v. Rippetoe, 72 Texas, 520. there was no proof of the correctness of the statement of facts. 3. Hearsay Evidence. — Conversations between the witness, a banker, and his cashier, relative to the amount of money paid the witness by defendant, occurring several hours after the payment was made, and not in the presence of the defendant, is hearsay and not admissible as res gestas. No part of this conversation was evoked by or explanatory of the transaction between the witness and the defendant, and it was error to admit it. 4. Weight of Evidence. — The following charge was held correctly given: “ When it is said in the charge that the burden of proof as to particular facts is on this or that party, and that the fact must be shown by a preponderance of evidence, it is not meant that such party is required to produce a greater number of witnesses than his adversary, but only that the fact shall reasonably appear by the greater weight of such testimony as may seem to you most worthy of credit under all the facts and circumstances of the case.'' 5. Evidence Admissible when Fraud Charged. —The suit being to recover a balance of $500, alleged to be due plaintiff, and damages for the fraud and deceit of defendant in paying his debt with an uncounted roll of money alleged to contain $1000, but in fact only containing $500, and thus obtaining the surrender of valuable securities, evidence that on other occasions and to other parties defendant had in like manner attempted to pay other claims, and that the uncounted roll of bills given in payment had afterward been discovered to be too little, is admissible, if the fact that the roll of money paid by defendant to the plaintiff contained less than $1000 is established by other evidence. The rule is well established, that when scienter and motive are involved, it is competent to show a series of similar acts by the defendant who is charged with guilty knowledge of fraudulent intent. Appeal from Washington. Tried below before Hon. T. S. Reese, Special Judge. The facts will be found in the report of the former appeal, in 63 Texas, 274-286. Searcy & Garrett, for appellant. 1. The court erred in permitting the plaintiff, over objection, to read from a statement of facts made up at a former trial of this case what purported to be the testimony of Jefferson Bassett, given upon such former trial, the said Bassett having since died, because the testimony of a deceased witness could not be reproduced in this way.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. Action of trespass to try title by J. C. Moses and others, plaintiffs in error, against W. C. Dibrell and G-. K. Elkins, defendants in error, brought on the 18th day of August, 1888, for two 640 acres surveys of land, patented to the heirs of David Moses, known as surveys numbers 499 and 500, the former by virtue of bounty warrant issued to the heirs of David Moses, and the latter by donation warrant issued to such heirs, patents dated respectively March 18, 1858, and March 22, 1858. Defendants pleaded not guilty; Dibrell setting up statute of limitation of five and of ten years to survey number 499, and Elkins same pleas of limitation to survey number 500. Upon trial, March 5, 1890, the jury returned a verdict for defendants as follows, “We, the jury, find for the defendants on the' grounds of limitation; ” and judgment was accordingly entered for them for the land respectively claimed by each. Plaintiffs have brought the case to this court by writ of error. There is no brief on file for defendants in error. The first assignment of error is: “The court erred in admitting in evidence the deed purporting to have been executed by N. R. May, as attorney in fact and agent for H. D. Moses and Amanda Shed, of date May 20, 1875, for the reasons set out in bills of exceptions numbers 1, 2, and 6.” Before the trial, March 4, 1889, plaintiffs demanded the filing by defendants of an abstract of their title, which was done on the 23d of March, 1889, as follows for G-. K. Elkins: “ 1. Power of attorney from H. Moses to N. R. May, dated October 12, 1873, to sell and sign deeds to the David Moses surveys of land in Coleman County, Texas, recorded in book D, records Brown County, page 282; said power of attorney now lost, and said records of Brown County now destroyed, and no certified copy procurable. “2. Deed of H. D. Moses and Amanda Shed, legal heirs of David Moses, deceased, by their attorney N. R. May, to G-. K. Elkins, same being a warranty deed from said parties to said Elkins, conveying two 640 acres tracts of land in Coleman County, Texas, patented to the- heirs of David Moses, deceased, known as surveys numbers 499 and 500. Acknowledged before J. T. Rankin, clerk District Court, Brown County, Texas, January 26, 1875; recorded in book A, records of deeds of Coleman County, pages 173, 174, 175, May 23, 1876. “ 3. Power of attorney from David Entriken and Amanda F. S. Entriken to L. G. Moses, dated March 8, 1854, authorizing L. Gf. Moses to procure, locate, and sell all lands belonging to them from State of Texas as heirs of David Moses, deceased. Acknowledged before Thomas G-. Sims, one of the justices of the Inferior Court of Coweta County, Georgia, 8th of March, 1854; original on file in Land Office, and copy recorded in Coleman County, book L, pages 517, 518, and 519, February 3, 1885. “ 4. Deed to Arthur J. Lott from L. G. Moses for self and attorney in fact for Amanda F. S. Entriken and David Entriken, conveying two tracts of land in Coleman County, Texas, known as surveys numbers 499 and 500, patented to the heirs of David Moses, deceased, deed dated November 29, 1856. Acknowledged before Geo. W. Campbell, notary public, in Washington County, Texas, November 29, 1856; recorded in Coleman County, Texas, February 17, 1885, book L, 519, 520, and 521. “ 5. Deed of W. L. Davidson to G. K. Elkins, same two surveys. Acknowledged January 4, 1886, and recorded in Coleman County, July 14, 1886. “ 6. Original patent survey number 500, date March 22, 1858.” Defendant Dibrell adopts the abstract above, except number 6, and makes for himself the following: “1. Deed from G. K. Elkins to W. M. Erath to survey number 499, of 640 acres, patented to the heirs of David Moses, in Coleman County, Texas, dated October 17, 1882. Acknowledged before L. C. Williamson, county clerk Coleman County, Texas, October 17, 1882, book G, 579 and 580. 1 ‘ 2. Deed from W. M. Erath to W. C. Dibrell, conveying same land as above in number 1, dated October 2, 1883. Acknowledged before L. C. Williamson, county clerk Coleman County, Texas, October 2, 1883; recorded in Coleman County, October 4, 1885, book K, 220. “ 3. Copy of patent from the State of Texas to said survey number 499 to heirs of David Moses.” The abstract also shows, that Elkins claims survey number 500 by limitation of five and ten years, and that Dibrell so claims survey number 499; and also both parties defendant set up outstanding title in L. G-. Moses and Amanda F. S. Entriken. On the 14 of October, 1889, James C. Moses, one of the plaintiffs, filed his affidavit, declaring that the power of attorney from H. Moses to N. R. May, of date October 12, 1873, was a forgery. The patents to the land were read in evidence, and there was proof tending to show that plaintiffs were the heirs of David Moses, to whose heirs the certificates were issued and the patents were granted. Defendants’ evidence tended to show, that the David Moses to Vhose heirs the certificates and the patents were issued was another man, a married man, and died in 1835 in Texas, leaving surviving him two children, his only heirs—a son, L. Gr. Moses, and a daughter, Amanda F. S. Moses; that the L. G-. Moses who, for himself and as attorney in fact for Amanda F. S.'Entriken, executed the deed to Arthur J. Lott, was an heir of David Moses, the married man, and that Mrs. Entriken was his daughter; and that W. L. Davidson, who conveyed the land to defendant Gr. K. Elkins, was an heir of Arthur J. Lott. Defendants read in evidence the deed by N. R. May, referred to in the abstract of title as “ attorney in fact for H. D. Moses and Amanda Shed, legal heirs of David Moses, deceased, to Gr. K. Elkins,” conveying the two 640 acres surveys in controversy, dated February 2, 1875, recorded in Coleman County, where the land is situated, May 16, 1876, in book A, pages 173, 174, and 175, “ the certificate of registration in Coleman County being attested by the signature of the county clerk with the seal of the District Court of Coleman County;” the certificate of acknowledgment being as follows: “ The State of Texas, Brown County.—Before me, John Y. Rankin, clerk District Court in and for said county of Brown, in the State of Texas, duly Commissioned and qualified, this day came and personally appeared N. R. May, agent and attorney in fact for H. D. Moses and Amanda Shed, of Pike County, Georgia, to me well known, formerly of the county of Freestone, to me personally known, who signed the names of said Moses and Shed as their agent and attorney in fact, and being by me duly sworn, signed and acknowledged the execution of the foregoing deed dated the 26th day of January, A. D. 1875, and delivered the same as their binding act and deed for the purposes and consideration herein set forth and contained. 1 ‘ Given under my hand and official seal, at office in Brown wood, Texas, this the 26th day of January, A. D. 1875. [Seal attached] “ J. Y. Rankin, “ Clerk District Court Brown County, Texas.” Defendants also introduced the record book of Coleman County, deed records, containing the record of the above deed, together with a certified copy of said deed under the hand and seal of county clerk of Coleman County, showing registration of deed in Coleman County, Texas, May 16, 1876. Defendants also introduced warranty deed by G. K. Elkins to W. M. Erath, conveying survey number 499 for 640""acres (being one of the tracts of land in controversy), dated October 17, 1882, duly recorded October 17, 1882, in Coleman County, Texas. Also, warranty deed by Erath to defendant Dibrell to survey 499 (same conveyed by Elkins to Erath, both mentioned in the abstract of title),. dated October 17, 1883, duly recorded in Coleman County on same day. Also, of L. G-. Moses, for himself and as attorney in fact for David Entriken and Amanda S. F. Entriken his wife, to Arthur J. Lott, conveying the land in suit, dated November 29, 1856, as conveying the interest of L. Gr. Moses only; recorded in Travis County April 12, 1858, and recorded in Coleman County February 3, 1885. Also, warranty deed by Davidson to G-. K. Elkins, defendant, conveying his undivided one-half of both surveys in suit, dated January 1, 1886, recorded in Coleman County, Texas, July 6, 1886. The evidence was sufficient to support the finding of the jury (if the verdict included such finding), that the David Moses under whom plaintiffs claim was the person to whose heirs the certificates were issued and the patents to the land in suit were granted. The evidence supports the finding of the jury, and we find, from the uncontradicted testimony, that defendant Elkins had adverse and continuous possession of survey number 500 from the time he bought from May (January 21, 1875), to the time this suit was instituted (August, 1888), claiming under the May deed and paying all the taxes; and that he had such possession in person for the year 1875, and by tenant after-wards up to the time he sold to Erath, of survey number 499, paying all the taxes; and that Erath had such possession of the same under his deed from Elkins, paying the taxes up to the time he sold to Dibrell, who in turn took possession at once under his deed and held possession until suit was brought; and that portions of such surveys were so occupied by the parties, and cultivated each and every year, from the time of entry to the time of suit. On this subject there is no conflict in the testimony. Under the first assignment of error, the first proposition by the plaintiff is, that “when a deed or a power of attorney under which it is executed is a forgery, it is error to admit it in evidence without proof of its execution as at common law.” This is true as to the instrument itself attacked by proper affidavit as a forgery. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 2257; Belcher v. Fox, 60 Texas, 528. But the statute prescribes no such rule of evidence as to a duly recorded deed or instrument executed by virtue of a power of attorney which is alleged to be a forgery. After filing the affidavit, the statute puts in issue the execution of the instrument so attacked, and puts the burden of proof Upon the party offering it, but expressly declares, that every instrument duly recorded, as required by law, shall be admitted in evidence without proof of its execution, unless attacked as a forgery. The statute lays down a rule of evidence, and the deed in question, if duly proven for record, other provisions of the law having been complied with, and there being as to it no issue of forgery, was admissible as a recorded instrument. Hancock v. Lumber Co., 65 Texas, 232. Plaintiffs also objected to the introduction of the deed by May to Elkins, on the ground that the certificate of registration by the county clerk of Coleman County was attested by the seal of the District Court. The deed was recorded Hay 16, 1876. The objection, if tenable, was fully met and obviated by the production of the record book itself from Coleman County, which contained the record of the deed, and a certified copy under the hand and seal of the county clerk of Coleman County, showing the registration of the deed in the county May 1.6, 1876. . Eev. Stats., art. 4299; 1 Pasch. Dig., arts. 5012, 5013, 5014. The next objection to the deed as a recorded instrument is, that the certificate of the clerk does not state that he identified the person making the acknowledgment as the person who signed the deed. The certificate does, in our opinion, identify May as personally known to the officer, and who then signed the instrument and acknowledged its execution, and delivered the same as the binding act of his principals, for the purposes, etc. The certificate, though not in technical form, substantially states the facts of a good acknowledgment, which authorized the deed’s registration. Eeading the whole certificate, we do not think it is difficult, as claimed by plaintiffs, to determine who appeared before the officer to acknowledge the deed, in what capacity, and whose act it was, and for whom. It is contended by plaintiffs, that a forged deed, or a deed under a forged power of attorney, will not support the plea of limitation. This is true as to the five years statute of limitations, as expressly provided by statute (Devised Statutes, article 3193), but the statute does not reach the case under the plea of ten years limitation. It seems reasonable, that as the statute specially refers'to the bar by five years limitation without including the ten years limitation, it was intended to exclude the claim by the ten years, and that the statutory rule would not apply to the latter. It must be borne in mind, that the deed by the agent is not impeached; it is only the power under which it was executed; and that this power was. not in evidence, presumably because it could not be proved as at common law, it having been lost and the record of it having been destroyed by fire, as stated in the abstract of title furnished by defendants upon demand of plaintiffs. The power is not shown to be a forgery, but only attacked as such, and if it were tendered in evidence, the burden'of proving its execution would be upon the defendants. It was not offered in evidence; it was abandoned, without attempt to prove its genuineness. The deed itself is not in the same condition; it is not impeached by affidavit; it is what it purports to be—a deed by May as agent to Elkins. It does not convey title had it been in May’s principals, but it is on its face a deed, containing all the elements of a valid deed tested by itself,, and we think may be the basis of- limitation by the ten years statute. The deed was duly acknowledged and duly recorded. Assuming that there was no power in the agent to make the conveyance, his act was a deed. In Wofford v. McKinna, 23 Texas, 44, where it was held that a void tax deed could be used as predicate of limitation, the question of necessity of a power was discussed; it is said: <{ It does not follow that it [a deed] is not a deed because the power of the agent is not produced.” It was held in Charle v. Saffold, 13 Texas, 109, 110, that a void will duly probated would furnish predicate for the ten years statute. We can not see that the absence of the power in this case can extend further than the mere fact that there is no power, and that the fact will not affect the deed as such under the ten years statute, to the extent of the boundaries as described therein. Bev. Stats., art. 3195; Lambert v. Weir, 27 Texas, 359; Jones v. Menard, 1 Texas, 771. The deeds from Elkins to Erath and from Erath to Dibrell described the land conveyed to Dibrell; and there being no doubt as to the possession for ten years as alleged by the defendants, the jury, under a proper charge of the court, could not have done otherwise than find for defendants on their pleas of ten years limitation. If we are correct in our conclusion, that defendants could base limitation upon the deed from May to Elkins, the court, under the testimony, should have directed the jury to find for defendants on the pleas of the statute of ten years limitation. This being established, it becomes unnecessary to examine the rulings of the court upon the introduction of the deed from Elkins to Erath and from him to Dibrell; objected to upon the same grounds as the deed from May to Elkins; or the charges of the court upon the five years statute, or any other rulings not before disposed of. We are of opinion that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed. Delivered February 22, 1893.","J. C. Moses et al. v. W. C. Dibrell et al. No. 141. 1. Recorded Instrument as Evidence—Forged Power.—An affidavit of forgery attacking the power under which an agent executed a deed which was duly acknowledged and recorded, does not prevent such deed from being admitted in evidence under article 2257, Revised Statutes. The statute declares that every instrument duly recorded shall be admitted in evidence * * * unless attacked as a forgery. 2. Want of Seal to Certificate of Record — Other Proof of the Record.—That a certificate of the record of a deed was not attested by the proper seal is no objection to the competency of such deed in evidence, it having been shown by the production of the record books that the deed was duly recorded in such records. 3. Official Certificate of Acknowledgment to Deed.—See certificate of acknowledgment to a deed held sufficient to show who appeared before the officer to acknowledge the deed, in what capacity, whose act it was, and for whom executed. 4. Limitation.—The express enactment that a forged instrument can not be the basis of limitation under the five years statute would seem to imply that the statutory rule would not obtain to the statute of ten years. 5. Basis for Ten Years Limitation—Deed which does not Pass Title.—A deed executed by an agent without authority to pass title to the land may be a basis for the defense of ten years limitation, when followed by actual possession under such deed.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This action was brought by the appellant on October 28,1882, in the District Court of Galveston County, in trespass to try title to recover of the appellee lots 507 and 508, section 1, on Galveston Island. Defendant pleaded not guilty; and specially pleaded peaceable, open, adverse, notorious, and uninterrupted use and enjoyment of the easement of the right of way over said lots 100 feet in width for more than four, ten, and twenty years prior to the institution of this suit; also, that Allen, Poole & Co., while owners of the land sued for, and through whom plaintiff acquired title, acquiesced in and recognized the right of defendant to use its right of way across said lots, and encouraged defendant to continue so doing, and gave defendant permission to lay side tracks and switches upon said lots; that the accquiescence, recognition, and permission of said Allen, Poole & Co. gave to defendant the use of the right of way, and that plaintiff was concluded therefore from attempting to deprive the defendant of the same. Further, that the use of said right of way was well known to the plaintiff, and he had full notice thereof, and was thereby estopped. Plaintiff replied to the answer by exceptions and pleas. The exceptions were overruled by the court. November 23, 1891, trial was had without a jury, and the court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the recovery of the lots sued for, subject, however, to the use, occupation, and enjoyment by defendant of the right of way thereon of one hundred feet in width, which was adjudged to the defendant. The case coinés up on exceptions to the admission of paroi evidence to establish an easement of a right of way over the land—that is, an estate in the land—by paroi permission, acquiescence, and gift of the then owners of the land; also, that the possession, use, and occupation of said right of way were not hostile or adverse to the right of the owners of the lots, and did not support the pleas of limitation. 1. In 1860 the title to the lot 507 was shown by the deeds introduced in evidence to be in Thomas E. Moore, who conveyed the same, March 15, 1861, to Richard Stoners, who conveyed to V. B. Poole, February 1, 1870. At that time the title to the lot 508 was in James H. Perkins, who, on December 10, 1868, conveyed it to John F. Megale, who, on May 21, 1869, conveyed the same to V. B. Poole, who conveyed to the firm of Allen, Poole & Co., February 17, 1870. 2. On September 10, 1874, the firm of Allen, Poole & Co. made an assignment to certain assignees for the benefit of their creditors. Their assignees conveyed the lots, April 30, 1881, to one W. II. Palmer, who, on October 22, 1881, conveyed the same to the plaintiff. There is no mention in any of these deeds of the use of the lots by the railway company. 3. Defendant’s railway was constructed over the lots in controversy in the fall of the year 1859. The line has not been changed since; and the road has been in operation by the running of trains over it continuously ever since February, 1860. Trains have been run over the road daily except when the bridge was out. It was not shown by what right the railway company entered upon the land. 4. Allen, Poole & Co. went upon the lots about 1868, and found the railway there. They made no objection to the road being there; they acquiesced in it, and verbally promised to give the company the right of way, and begged it to put in side tracks, which the company did. The witness Poole stated also, that his firm gave the company the right of way, and would have given it a formal deed if they had been requested to do so. More than ten years elapsed from said verbal gift of the right of way until the filing of this suit. 1. The use and possession of the lot in controversy by the defendant as a right of way amounts to an easement therein, which is an estate or interest in the land, which could only be created by deed or grant. Rev. Stats., art. 2464; Railway v. Durrett, 57 Texas, 50; Railway v. Donahoo, 59 Texas, 131. Hence the evidence of Poole, tending to show a verbal gift of the right of way to the defendant, would not be admissible for that purpose alone; but it was admissible for the purpose of showing the character of the defendant’s possession, and as coupled with other evidence, to show the acquisition of the right to the easement by limitation or by the laying of side tracks upon the land. The evidence does not show that the defendant entered upon the lots and used the same under a mere paroi license from the owner. The defendant entered upon the lots and constructed its roadbed thereon in the fall of 1859, and occupied a portion thereof with its track continuously after that time. It also ran trains over the road daily from February, 1860, until the time of the trial, with the exception of the time, as stated by the witness Hoxie, when the bridge was out. How long this may have been was not shown; but it was shown that the line of the track remained unchanged during the whole time. The entry was a trespass, and the use and occupation of the land, from its exclusive nature, was plainly adverse to the owner. Poole’s evidence showed that his firm found the railway upon the land in 1868, and that they made no objection to its occupation and use, but on the contrary acquiesced therein, and verbally gave a promise to give the company the right of way, and would have executed a formal deed thereto if it had been requested. We do not think that the exercise of acts upon the land of another that would amount to an easement if done under authority of a deed or grant, should necessarily be held to be exercised by the mere license of the owner when the authority is conferred only by paroi. Possession and use of land under a paroi sale or gift thereof is adverse to the seller or donor. The evidence in this case precludes the idea that the railway company was occupying the land under a mere paroi license from Allen, Poole & Co. 2. An easement in land may be acquired by prescription which would presume a grant. Tied, on Real Prop., see. 599; Godd. on Law of Ease., 131, et seq. Without regard to the rule, that the prescription in favor of a grant arising from the lapse of time might be rebutted by showing that there was in fact no grant, it seems that the law of limitations would run in this State in support of an easement. In Baker v. Brown, 55 Texas, 381, the court applies the statute of ten years limitation to the right to divert water for irrigation. So in Benavides v. Hunt, 79 Texas, 385, it is held that the ten years statute applies to an action by a lessee of the right to mine. See, also, Railway v. Poindexter, 70 Texas, 98; and Railway v. Wilson, 83 Texas, 153. Plaintiff’s contention is, that there was not an adverse claim of the right of way by the defendant, nor for such period as would confer title under the statute of ten years limitation, and that whatever may have been the claim of the defendant before Allen, Poole & Co. became the owners of the land, the right of way was used then in recognition of their title and under a paroi license from them. But as we have already said, the facts do not show that the defendant acted under a mere license. The possession and occupation by defendant under the verbal gift of the right of way, as testified to by Poole, was such adverse possession and use thereof as would put in operation the statute of limitations; and it was shown that there was such possession and use for more than ten years prior to the institution of this suit. 3. A paroi gift of land will be sustained when possession has been taken and valuable improvements made on the faith of it. It was shown that Allen, Poole & Co. gave the right of way to the defendant, and that it put in side tracks; and we may easily infer from the evidence that the side tracks were put in for the benefit of Allen, Poole & Co., as well as. of the company. In the case of Railway v. Jarrell, 60 Texas, 267, a verbal agreement to give the right of way to a railway was upheld. There was no contention in that case that Jarrell was in any way obligated or bound in writing to give the right of way. It was held, that under all the facts disclosed as to the agreement in reference to the right of way, which was verbal, and as to the actual entry under the agreement, and the things transpiring between the parties after the entry, matters had reached a stage at which the agreement or license to enter could not be-entirely repudiated by the appellee and the permission to enter revoked, and that Jarrell could not maintain an action of ejectment. We are of the opinion that the defendant had acquired the right of way both by limitation and by possession and improvement under the' donation thereof by Allen, Poole & Co.; and that there was therefore no error in the judgment of the court below. The judgment will be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 9, 1893.","B. A. Shepard v. The Galveston, Houston & Henderson Railway Company. No. 91. 1. Basement Acquired by Limitation.—In 1859 the railway company constructed its road over the lots sued for. The line has not been changed since, and daily trains have been running over it since February, 1860, except when the bridge was out. In 1868, Allen, Poole & Co. went on the lots and found the road there, and acquiesced in it, and verbally promised to give the company the right of way. Held, the company had acquired title by limitation, this suit to recover the lots having been brought in 1882. 2. Adverse Possession of an Basement. — The entry upon the land was a trespass, and its use and occupation from its exclusive nature was plainly adverse to the owner. Allen, Poole & Co. found the road on the land, and verbally promised to give the right of way to the company. We do not think that the exercise of acts upon the land of another that would amount to an easement if done under authority of a deed or grant, should necessarily be held to be exercised by the mere license of the owner when the authority is conferred only by paroi. The possession and occupation under the verbal gift was such adverse possession and use thereof as would put in operation the statute of limitations. 3. Parol Gift and Valuable Improvements. — It was shown that Allen, Poole & Co. gave the right of way to the defendant, and that at their request, and we may infer from the evidence for their benefit, the defendant put in side tracks upon the land. The company has been in possession more than ten years, and have acquired the right of way by possession and improvement under the donation. Appeal from Galveston. Tried below before Hon. Wm. H. Stewaet. Hume & Kleberg, for appellant. 1. The claim of defendant is, that plaintiff’s action should fail, because defendant had acquired an easement of a right of way over the land—that is, an estate in the land—by paroi permission, acquiescence, and gift of the then owners of the land. Such an easement lies in grant, and can not pass by paroi. Rev. Stats., art. 548; Railway v. Durrett, 57 Texas, 51; Washb. on Ease, and Serv., 23; Railway v.

The case is, that defendant, having no right, and claiming none, obtained the paroi promise of Allen, Poole & Co. to give it the right of way, and this without consideration of any kind and without any change of defendant’s position on the faith thereof.

Thomas J. Ballinger and Charles Frankell, for appellee. 1. Peaceable, continuous, and uninterrupted possession of a right of way over land for four, ten, and twenty years, respectively, by a railway company, acquiesced in and paroi permission given by the owner in fee, constitute sufficient grounds for a prescriptive right to an easement in the nature of a right of way. 2. Such an easement lies in grant, express or implied. User for ten and twenty years presupposes or implies a grant. Parol permission, acquiescence, and gift of the right of way by the owner of the land, when accepted and acted upon, can not be revoked as in the case of a mere license. Rev.

Railway (Indiana), 27 Northeastern Reporter, 219, it was held, that a license given by a land owner permitting a railway company to enter upon his land and construct its roadbed is revocable only as it is executory, and after the company has spent large sums of money under such license the power to revoke is lost; citing 71 Ind., 265; 27 Ind., 534; 19 Ind., 10; 14 Ind., 367; 113 Ind., 223; 113 Ind., 233. See, also, Risien v. Brown, 73 Texas, 135. Putting all authorities aside, however, the statement that the paroi gift of a right of way is void under the statute of frauds is absolutely untenable.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellant sued appellee Collins in trespass to try title, to recover the southern half of a tract of 300 acres of land patented to Win. Granad, assignee of T. P. Bhodes. Appellee pleaded not guilty, and title by limitation of three, five, and ten years. Appellant amended his pleadings, and alleged that he had bought the land from Alfred Chesnut, from whom he received a deed, with covenants of general warranty of title, which were set out; and alleged that defendant was in possession, claiming title to the land by limitation of five years under a prior deed from said Chesnut and W. J. Townsend, and asked that Chesnut be cited and made party to the cause, and required to prosecute the suit and make good the title conveyed to appellant, and, in case title should be adjudged to be in Collins, that judgment be rendered in appellant’s favor for the purchase money and interest, the amount of which was stated. Chesnut answered, and demurred generally to this petition. At the trial, the court below sustained this general demurrer, discharged Chesnut from the suit, and rendered judgment against appellant for the cost of that proceeding. After hearing the case on the facts, the court rendered judgment in favor of appellee Collins for the land, on his plea of limitation of three and five years. The motion for a new trial, assignment of errors, and briefs, present the points discussed in the opinion. The titles asserted by the parties were as follows: Granad conveyed an undivided half-interest in the land to one Finley, Who, in 1859, conveyed to James Gibson. Gibson and Granad agreed on a partition by which Gibson was to take the south half. No actual line was established, but the land was in the shape of a rectangle, and it was only necessary in order to divide it in halves to run a line through 'the center east and west. On July 17, 1884, Gibson conveyed the southern half of the tract to Alfred Chesnut, from whom appellant derives his title by regular chain of transfers. . ' Appellee Collins entered upon the north half of the land about sixteen or eighteen years before the trial, supposing it to be vacant and intending to pre-empt it. Sometime afterward there was a transaction between him and Gibson, in which he claims to have bought all of Gibson’s interest in the 300 acres. Gibson claims that he only agreed not to interfere with appellee’s efforts to acquire title to the north half by pre-emption. Collins paid Gibson $20, and gave his note for $30, as the consideration of the agreement. No deed was made, and it was not shown that Collins has made any improvement on the faith of the agreement, and the note was never paid. On March 27, 1883, the heirs of William Granad, who was then dead, conveyed to Mary Duke “all their right, title, and interest in the 300 acres.” Mary Duke, on the 25th day of May, 1883, conveyed the same to W J. Townsend and Alfred Chesnut. The deed from Granad to Finley and that from Finley to Gibson were on record before the dates of these deeds, and all the parties had actual knowledge of them, and neither Duke nor Townsend and Chesnut claimed more than the north half, recognizing Gibson’s title to the other, as well as the partition agreed on. On the 2nd day of June, 1883, Townsend and Chesnut executed to Collins a deed which described the land conveyed as follows: ‘‘All that certain tract or parcel of land situated in said county and State, located about eight miles southwesterly from Homer, it being the north half of a 300 acres survey in the name of T. P. Rhodes, it being the same that we purchased from Mary Duke by deed bearing date May 25, 1883; for a full and complete description of said land reference is made to the patent from the State of Texas to Wm. Granad, assignee of T. P. Rhodes, which is herewith delivered and made a part of this conveyance. It is understood that we convey all the rights, title, and interest that Mrs. Mary Duke had to the T. P. Rhodes 300 acres survey of land, but we only warrant the title to 150 acres of said survey, it being the north half, and the part on which T. F. Collins now resides.” At the time this deed was made Collins had full knowledge of the title in Gibson. Townsend and Chesnut both testified that he recognized Gibson’s title, and that they all understood that only the north half was conveyed, but that Collins being fearful that Gibson, by reason of his title, papers calling for an undivided portion, would claim an interest in the north half, the deed, in order to quiet these apprehensions, was drawn so-that, in case Gibson interfered with Collins on the north half, the latter could claim an interest in the other part. Collins testified, that he bought the entire 300 acres from Townsend and Chesnut, and that they told him they were selling him the entire tract, but would warrant the title only as to the north half. He further testified, that lie had paid taxes on the whole tract, and had claimed the whole tract, had cultivated, used, and enjoyed it ever since he went into possession. None of his improvements were on the south half. He does not deny the conversations testified to by Townsend and Chesnut, in which he seems to have recognized the Gibson title, and it does not appear that Gibson or any of his vendees ever learned that Collins was claiming the whole of the tract until it was ascertained that he was paying taxes on it. How long this was before the suit does not appear. I. The sustaining of Chesnut’s general demurrer and adjudging against appellant the costs of bringing him into the suit was error. Appellant had the right to have his warrantor cited to come in and maintain the title and make good his warranty. The right of a plaintiff to do this has been denied by the Supreme Court of Tennessee, while it was admitted that a defendant could. Ferrell v. Alder, 8 Humph., 44. But in Vermont (Park v. Bates, 12 Vermont, 381; Petkin v. Leavitt, 13 Vermont, 379; Brown v. Taylor, 13 Vermont, 637) and in Georgia (Gregg v. Richardson, 25 Georgia, 570) the contrary rule has been established, and we can see no good ground upon which to dissent from the reasoning employed in those cases. Rawle on Cov., 220. In White v. Williams, 13 Texas, 258, a plaintiff brought in his warrantor, as was here attempted, but the question as to his right to do so was not adjudicated. In the Vermont and Georgia cases no effort was made by the plaintiffs in the ejectment suits to recover judgments over against the warrantors, as was here sought, but the object of citing them was to require them to prosecute the action brought by the warrantees to obtain possession, and to conclude them by the judgments to be rendered. The provisions of our statutes (Revised Statutes, art. 4788) allowing warrantors to be brought in by defendants, in trespass to try title, does not change any rule of practice which may allow to the plaintiff the same remedy. Whether the plaintiff could, in this suit, recover judgment on the warranty or not (which is a question we need not, in view of the disposition to be made of the case, determine) he has the right to bring his warrantor in to maintain the title he had conveyed, or be concluded by the judgment, and it was error to sustain the general demurrer. II. It is not pretended by appellee in his testimony that when he originally entered he had possession of or asserted claim to any part of the south half of the land, but he says he entered upon the north half with intent to pre-empt. If he had thus possessed himself of the southern part of the land, in the effort to acquire title by pre-emption, this, it seems, would not be a possession adverse to the true owner. Schleicher v. Gatlin, 20 S. W. Rep., 120. If he afterwards bought from Gibson, as he claims, all the latter’s interest, by oral contract, he shows no facts sufficient to establish title under that agreement, either legal or equitable; and it can not be claimed that, so long as he held under that purchase, his possession was adverse to Gib.son. He consequently did not acquire title by limitation before he bought from Townsend and Chesnut. That deed does not purport to convey a greater interest than had been passed by deed from the heirs of Granad. They held title only to the north half, and that is all the deed conveyed. Under the peculiar language of the deed from Townsend and Chesnut to appellee, and its correspondence with and apparent recognition of the true condition of the title, it can not beheld that appellee’s possession of the north half should be extended by construction to the boundaries of the whole tract. That possession was entirely consistent with the claim of appellants to the south half, and the terms of the deed would not convey reasonable notice to them that appellee’s claim extended throughout the tract. If the agreement between the former owners to divide the land be disregarded, that would not help appellee’s case; for then it could not be held that the deed from Townsend and Chesnut to him passed title to more than an undivided half-interest in the 300 acres. This would have made him a tenant in common with the owners of the other half, and no such facts are shown as would put in motion the statute of limitations against his cotenant. “The mere possession itself would be referred to that right which every tenant in common has to peaceably settle upon and enjoy the occupation of the common property, without ousting his co-tenant. Hence such occirpancy was not in itself sufficient to charge the appellants with notice that their interest in the land was disputed, and that the benefit of the statute of limitation would be claimed by their co-tenants, if suit were not brought within time to prevent the bar.” Moody v. Butler, 63 Texas, 213. Delivered November 24, 1892. The court below erred in holding that Collins had acquired title to the land sued for by limitation, and its judgment will be reversed and here-rendered for appellant, that he recover of appellee Collins the south half of the 300 acres tract, that is, the portion of said tract lying south of a line running east arid west through its center, and all costs of this suit, except the costs making Chesnut a party, which will be recovered by appellant of Chesnut. Reversed and rendered-","G. W. Norton v. T. F. Collins et al. No. 37. 1. Warrantor — Plaintiffs Right to Call in. — Appellant had the right to have his warrantor cited to come in and maintain the title and make good his warranty. The provisions of our statutes (Revised Statutes, article 4788) allowing warrantors to be brought in by defendants in trespass to try title, does not change any rule of practice which may allow to the plaintiff the same remedy. Whether the plaintiff in this suit could recover judgment upon his warranty is not necessary (in the disposition we shall make of the case) to determine; but he had the right to bring him in to maintain the title, and to be concluded by the judgment, and it was error to sustain the general demurrer. 2. Adverse Possession. — About sixteen years before suit C. entered upon the north half of the 300 acres tract of land in controversy, supposing it was vacant and desiring to pre-empt it. In 1859 the then owners of the north and south half agreed to a partition; one of them was to take the north half and the other the south. The tract was a rectangle, and could be divided by a right line through the center from east to west. No actual partition line was run, but subsequent deeds in the chain of title which were recorded recognized such partition. By a transaction with G., the owner of the south half, C. claims to have bought all of G.:s interest in the 300 acres, but no deed was made. In 1883, the then owners of the north half conveyed it to C., describing the north half, but the deed further stated that they conveyed all the interest that D. (a former owner) had in the whole tract, but they only warranted 150 acres. C. had paid taxes on the whole tract. Suit being instituted May 11,1889, under the above facts, (Vs possession was held not to he adverse to the owner of the south half. 3. Same. — ('. entered on the north half with intent to pre-empt it. If he had thus possessed himself of the south half, it would not have been possession adverse to the true owner. 4. Same. — Under the peculiar language of the deed from Townsend and Chesnut to appellee, and its correspondence with and apparent recognition of the true condition of the title, it can not be held that appellee’s possession of the north half should he extended by construction to the boundaries of the whole tract. That possession was consistent with the claim of appellant to the south half, and if there had been no partition appellee’s possession would have been that of a tenant in common, and would not have been adverse to the owner of the other undivided half-interest.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This suit was brought by Jerry Robinson against John M. Jones, for the recovery of an undivided one-third interest in a number of lots of land on Galveston Island. The defense is outstanding title and limitation. Plaintiff showed title as follows: 1. Patent by the State of Texas to Edward Hall and Levi Jones. 2. Power of attorney from Edward Hall to William Bryan. 3. Deed from Edward Hall, by William Bryan, attorney in fact, to John M. Jones and Henry Hubbell, dated October 9, 1847. 4. Deed from John M. Jones and Henry Hubbell to Edward Hall for an undivided one-third interest in the land, dated October 13, 1847. 5. Will of Edward Hall, devising the land to his wife, Eliza Ann. 6. Deed from Eliza Ann Hall, widow of Edward Hall, to John McDougal, dated October 1, 1885= 7. Deed from John McDougal to the plaintiff, Jerry Robinson, dated September 18, 1890. The defendant put in evidence a deed dated October 9, 1867, from Edward Hall to Henry B. Andrews, John M. Jones, and the estate of Lorin Kent, deceased, wherein he conveyed, “in addition to the property conveyed to them by deed bearing date November 20,1866, all legal and equitable rights and privileges and titles to any and all locations made by me on Galveston Island, Texas, either individually or in connection with others.” He further offered in evidence. 1. The deed of Edward Hall, by Bryan, attorney in fact, to John M. Jones and Henry Hubbell, above recited, which shaw's that it was recorded in the record of deeds for Galveston County, October 19, 1847, and recited a consideration of 8800 and other considerations. 2. Proceedings in cause number 441, M. B. Menard v. John M. Jones, Henry Hubbell, and Edward Hall, to foreclose mortgage for the purchase money notes given by Jones and Hubbell for the land. No service was had on Hall, and the suit was dismissed as to him. There was judgment and foreclosure as to Jones and Hubbell. 3. Execution and return of sale in said cause, showing sale of property to the plaintiff, M. B. Menard, on the first Tuesday in March, 1850. 4. Deed of M. B. Menard to John M. Jones and Henry Hubbell, dated June 13, 1850, recorded October 28, 1851, releasing and quitclaiming the land to Jones and Hubbell. 5. Henry Hubbell died in 1853, and his estate was regularly administered in Galveston Count)'. A half-interest in the property described in the deed from Hall, by Bryan as attorney in fact, to Jones and Hubbell was inventoried among the assets of the estate, and was duly sold by the administrator and purchased by the defendant, John M. Jones, who received a deed therefor, which was recorded in Galveston County in 1855. The evidence also showed, that the land patented to Edward Hall and Levi Jones had been partitioned between them, and that other persons, viz., John C. Watrous, R. C. Franklin, and William Bryan, were interested with Hall in his half-interest in the land, although the legal title was in him. There was a partition of the interest set apart to Hall between him and those interested with him, except as to the several bayous and portions of the land covered with water included within the bounds of the patent to Levi Jones and Edward Hall, and the several sections assigned to Edward Hall which were declared by the decree of partition to be the common property of Hall, Bryan, Watrous, and Franklin. From certain papers attached to the decree of partition, read in evidence, it appeared that Hall, for himself and as attorney for Bryan, had made application to the surveyor of Galveston County for a survey of all the public domain of Galveston Island; and also for the location of certain land scrip on the shoals and reefs in front of and adjoining the city of Galveston. In submitting the deed from Edward Hall to H. B. Andrews, John M. Jones, and the estate of Lorin Kent, to the jury, the court charged them as follows: “As to the said instrument of writing of date October 9, 1867, and filed for record August, 1872, it is ambiguous as to the word 1 locations;’ the language of the said instrument is, that he ‘ do bargain, sell, and convey to the parties above named, in addition to the property conveyed to them by deed bearing date November 20, 1866, all legal and equitable rights and privileges and titles to any and all locations made by me on Galveston Island, Texas, either individually or in connection with others.’ The ambiguity arises from the word ‘locations,’ used in said instrument. If you believe from the evidence that Hall, by himself, or with others or another, had made locations on Galveston Island not embracing the land in controversy, which land in controversy was then patented, you must determine from the evidence whether the word ‘ locations ’ embraced the patented land in controversy, or only embraced the locations not embraced in the land in controversy; for if you believe from the evidence that the word ‘ locations ’ used in said instrument only embraced the said other locations, then the said instrument would not defeat the regular chain of title in the plaintiff Robinson for one undivided third of the property described in the petition.” The plaintiff has assigned error upon this instruction, because it was the duty of the court to construe the deed for the jury, since there was nothing ambiguous or doubtful as to the terms of the deed with respect to what was undertaken to be conveyed, and no evidence was offered by the defendant to show that the property in controversy was intended to be conveyed by the deed referred to; and there is no evidence to show that either Jones, Kent’s estate, or Andrews ever claimed title to the land under said deed, but that on the contrary the evidence showed that it was claimed by the defendant Jones under title from Edward Hall, deraigned through regular conveyances from October 9, 1847, down to the date of the trial. The admission of the deed in evidence was also objected to by plaintiff’s counsel, because on its face'it did not pass title to the property in controversy from Edward Hall to Jones, Kent, and Andrews, and the deed was not offered for any other purpose; that it had no power or force to pass title to the patented lands that had passed from its locative relation into patent, and out of patent into title, by deed from Edward Hall to others and back to Edward Hall, of the one-third interest in controversy, and not held by right of location, but by due conveyance from private parties, when he executed the deed. Has the word ‘ ‘ locations ’ ’ a fixed legal meaning, which must control the court in the construction of the deed in question ? The primary signification of the word “ location,” as applied to land, is the land designated by a person when he files a valid land certificate with the proper surveyor and makes an application for the survey of land subject to location by virtue of the certificate. Such person acquires a vested right in the land, and to have the same appropriated to his certificate, surveyed, and finally patented upon proper return of the field notes and otherwise complying with the law. But when the term is used by a person in speaking of locations made by himself, it would ordinarily apply to the land surveyed for him on his application, without any restricted meaning as to whether it was land filed upon, surveyed, or patented. This is the meaning claimed for the term by the appellant. Yet it might be used in a still broader sense by a grantor in conveying lands to designate the same as all “ locations ” made by him, although a part had been conveyed away to others and reconveyed to him, as contradistinguished from lands not located by him, but conveyed to him by others. Hence we conclude, that the word “ locations,” as used in the deed from Edward Hall to the defendant John M. Jones and others, has no such well defined meaning as would enable the court to construe the instrument without the aid of evidence, and that it was proper to admit evidence to show to what subject matter it applied; and if it should appear from the evidence that the term could be clearly applied to certain lands on Galveston Island, then it should be so applied; but if the application is still left in doubt and can not be made, nothing should pass by the conveyance. But, as we have seen, the word “ locations ” is directly applicable to the files shown to have been made by Edward Hall for himself and Bryan on all the public domain on Galveston Island, and the shoals and reefs in front of the city, as well as to the patented location on the bayous and land covered by water which had not been partitioned; and such being the case, and there being no evidence tending to show that the land reconveyed to Hall by Jones and Hubbell was intended to be conveyed, it was error to charge the jury, that if they believed from the evidence that , Hall by himself, or in connection with another or others, had made locatians on Galveston Island not embracing the land in controversy, which had been patented, then they should determine from the evidence whether the word “ locations ” embraced the patented land in controversy, or only embraced the locations other than the land in controversy. It would have been proper, in view of the evidence before the jury, to have given the instruction’ requested by plaintiff, that the title to the property in controversy did not pass from Hall by the deed in question. The deed from Menard to Jones and Hubbell, after the execution sale of the property to him, left the title to the land, as far as it concerned Hall, just as it stood before the foreclosure, as he was not a party to the suit. And as Jones and Hubbell had conveyed the land to Hall with a warranty as against the claims of themselves, the purchase by them from Menard was perfectly consistent with Hall’s title, and does not show any claim by them to the land adverse to the title of Hall to an undivided one-third interest therein. So also, possession of the land and payment of taxes by Jones was not inconsistent with the title of his tenant in common. There is no evidence to show the assertion of an adverse title or possession until the purchase by Jones from the Hubbell estate, and the placing of the administrator’s deed to Jones for the land upon record, which was done in 1855. The evidence does not show that even five years possession such as Jones could prescribe under was had by him prior to the war. The deeds from Menard to Hubbell and Jones and from Hubbell to Jones were of themselves sufficient to support the five years statute of limitations, on proof of an adverse possession under them and payment of taxes. Even if it should be held that the possession under the Menard deed was adverse, yet it is not shown that Jones’ tenant, Homberg, had possession for five years from the date of its record. In this connection, it may be said, that the fact that the land had been cut up into 10-acre lots would not confine the constructive possession to the particular lot occupied, because the land was conveyed as a whole, and there were no separate claimants of distinct lots. If it should be shown that there was sufficient possession of any part of the land in controversy to put the statute of limitations into effect, such possession would extend by construction to all of the land included in the deeds; unless, however, the defendant Jones should have leased a part of the land including the actual possession, in which event he would have put himself out of the constructive possession of the balance. Goodrich Jones testified to the payment of taxes, and that in 1881 he had a part of the land fenced in, viz., lots 74, 77, and 88, and that a German was in possession thereof, renting from him; that this tenant stayed there for five years. As to whether or not this was a possession of all the land would depend upon the extent of the lease—whether it was only for the lots named or for the entire tract. There was other evidence as to possession, but not of a satisfactory nature. The judgment of the court below can not be sustained on the proof in behalf of the plea of limitations, and for the error indicated it will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 23, 1893.","Jerry Robinson v. John M. Jones. No. 55. 1. Construction of Deed—Word “ Locations.”—The language of the deed was: “Do bargain, sell, and convey * * * all legal and equitable rights, privileges, and titles to any and all locations made by me on Galveston Island.” A charge, “ If you believe from the evidence that Hall, by himself or with others or another, had made locations on Galveston Island not embracing the land in controversy, which land in controversy was then patented, you must determine from the evidence whether the word 1 locations’ embraced the patented land in controversy, or only other locations,” was erroneous. 2. Construction of Deed for the Court and not for the Jury.—When the word “ locations” in a deed was directly applicable to files shown to have been made,but not on the land in controversy (which had been patented), and no evidence was offered to show that the property in controversy was intended to be conveyed by that word, or that the grantees ever claimed title under that deed-the jury might properly have been told that the patented lands did not pass by it- 3. Practice—Dismissal of Suit as to a Claimant of Land—Effect of.—Holder of purchase money notes sued the makers and Hall, who claimed title to the land. He dismissed as to Hall, and took foreclosure j udgment against the makers of the notes, sold the land, and bought it in himself. The title to the land, so far as it concerned Hall, stood just as it was before the foreclosure, and those holding title under the foreclosure sale were tenants in common with Hall. 4. Subdivision into Lots—Effect of, on Possession.—The fact that the land had been cut up into ten-acre lots would not confine the constructs e possession to the particular lot occupied, because the land was conveyed as a whole; unless the owner had leased a part of the land, including his actual possession, in which event he would have put himself out of the constructive possession of the balance. Appeal from Galveston. Tried below before Hon. W. H. Stewart. Willie & Ballinger, for appellant. 1. It is the duty of the judge to -construe written instruments, and their construction should never be left to the jury. The term “locations” used in the deed was not ambiguous, but had a well defined meaning, namely, land merely set off from the public lands, and surveyed, and in some cases patented; and it did not apply to lands held by Hall, not by virtue of location, but by purchase from others. The uncontradicted evidence showed that at the time Hall made the deed to Andrews, Kent, and Jones, he claimed the lands in controversy by deed from Jones and Hubbell, and not by location, the title by location having long previously passed out of him. San Antonio v. Lewis, 9 Texas, 69; Swift v. Herrera, 9 Texas, 263; Wright v. Thompson, 14 Texas, 558; Beale v. Ryan, 40 Texas, 409; Cook v. Dennis, 61 Texas, 249; Shepherd v. White, 11 Texas, 346. 2. The evidence does not show that Jones held any possession of said land adverse to the claim of Hall or of those claiming under him. Rev. Stats.,arts. 3191-3199; Moody v.

Miller, 76 Texas, 596. Robert G. Street, for appellee. The title to the land rests on a. location made by Hall and Jones on Galveston Island; and that fact being admitted, by proper legal construction the deed must be held to embrace any interest Hall may have had in it, whether resting immediately on such locations or upon a reconveyance by his vendees; and if it was competent to make the inquiry, the burden was upon the plaintiff himself to show that it was not included."
"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. This is an action in which the appellee, Joseph Fischl, who was the plaintiff in the court below, sued the appellant, Charles Dillingham, as receiver of the Houston & Texas Central Railway Company, who was defendant in the court below, in the District Court of Washington County, on the 22nd day of February, 1890, to recover the statutory penalty for refusing to deliver a car of flour shipped from St. Louis, Missouri, to Brenham, Texas, directed to appellee by the terms of the bill of lading. The penalty sued for was the sum of $94.88, the amount specified in the bill of lading, for each day the flour was detained. The appellee was a merchant doing business in Brenham, Texas, and on or about the 16th day of December, 1889, appellee purchased a car of flour, weighing 23,720 pounds, from the Kaufman Milling Company, in St. Louis, Missouri. The contract of purchase was made through one Slater, who was the agent of the Kaufman Milling Company at Brenham, Texas; and on or about the said 16th day of December, 1889, the Kaufman Milling Company, acting for and on behalf of the appellee, Joseph Fischl, delivered said car of flour to the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway, which was then and there a common carrier from the city of St. Louis, Missouri, into the State of Texas, making connection with the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway and the Houston & Texas Central Railway, leading to the city of Brenham, in the State of Texas. The said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company issued, executed, and delivered to appellee’s agent, the Kaufman Milling Company, in the city of St. Louis, Missouri, a bill of lading, whereby it acknowledged it had received said car of flour for shipment from St. Louis, Missouri, to Brenham, Texas, and it appeared from said bill of lading that the rate of freight on said flour was 40 cents per 100 pounds, via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway, from St. Louis to Brenham, Texas, and that said freight was to be carried via said railway (the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe); and when said car of flour arrived at its destination, Brenham, Texas, the appellee tendered the appellant the sum of $94.88, which was the amount specified in the bill of lading, which amount was declined, and 53 cents per 100, the established rate, demanded, which was refused by appellee. The defendant answered by a general and special demurrer and general and special answer. The special demurrer was sustained. The special answer alleged, that said car of flour was shipped from St. Louis, Missouri, to Brenham, Texas; that when said car of flour reached and arrived at Corsicana, it was, in the due course of business, turned over to defendant for transportation to Brenham, and that said flour was carried to Brenham within a reasonable time and in good order and condition; that after said car of flour arrived at Brenham, its destination, the same was tendered to appellee, demanding of him the regular schedule rate, which he refused to pay, and left said flour in the possession of appellant. That appellant, before and at the time of the shipment of said flour, had established schedule rates of freight, as required by the act of Congress, and that the schedule rate on flour from St. Louis, Missouri, to Brenham, Texas, was 53 cents per 100 pounds'via the Houston & Texas Central Railway. That the said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway did not run into the city of Brenham, and all goods and merchandise from Brenham via the Houston & Texas Central Railway was delivered to appellant at Corsicana, a station on the line of its road. And the appellant further alleged and charged, that after said flour arrived in the city of Brenham, its destination, and after appellee refused to pay the schedule charges due thereon, that his (appellee’s) agent, or some person for him in St. Louis, Missouri, the Kaufman Milling Company, telegraphed said appellee, Joseph Fischl, to pay schedule charges demanded of him by appellant, and that they would protect and hold appellee harmless, all of which appellee refused to do, but said flour remained in the possession of appellant for more than a month, when the appellee paid the schedule charges and took said flour. The appellee demanded a jury, and said cause was tried and resulted in a verdict and judgment for appellee for $4079.84. A motion for a new trial was made and overruled, and notice of appeal given. Appellant’s first assignment of error is as follows: 11 The court erred in not permitting the defendant, Dillingham, to establish and prove the fact by the plaintiff and other competent testimony that the said Kaufman Milling Company proposed and would have held the plaintiff, Fischl, harmless, and offered to pay the difference between 40 and 53 cents per 100 pounds on the car of flour.” We are of the opinion that this assignment presents a proposition which can not be sustained, and that the court did not err in excluding the evidence offered by appellant to show that the appellee would not consent that the difference between rate of freight specified in the bill of lading and that demanded by appellant might be paid by the Kaufman Milling Company. If the appellant be liable for the penalty imposed by the statute for demanding more freight than that named in, the bill of lading, and refusing to deliver the freight to the consignee until the freight demanded was paid by the consignee, the latter could not be deprived of the right to recover the penalty by the willingness of a third party to pay the difference in the freights. Had this difference been paid by the shipper to the appellant, and appellant had then made a tender to appellee of the goods, upon payment by the latter of the freight charges named in the bill of lading, it may be that from such tender by appellant he would have been relieved from any further liability under the statute. But it certainly was not incumbent upon appellee to aid and assist the appellant in relieving himself from any liability he had incurred to appellee, or would incur, by continuing to hold the goods after their delivery had been demanded. The appellant’s eleventh assignment is as follows: “The court erred in following the State statute when it conflicted with the act of Congress, and instructed the jury under the terms of the State statute to find for the plaintiff.” This assignment presents the controlling question of the case, and upon its solution depends the affirmance or reversal of the judgment of the lower court. The evidence shows, we think, beyond cavil, that the carload of flour, the alleged illegal detention of which by appellant is the basis of appellee’s suit, was purchased by appellee’s agent in St. Louis, Missouri, and by him delivered to the agent of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway, a common carrier from the State of Missouri into the State of Texas, and that said railway had connection with two railways in the State of Texas, to-wit, the defendant railway and the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway, and that with each of the said railways the said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway had, at and previous to the delivery of said flour, an agreed and established rate of freight between the city of St. Louis, in Missouri, and the city of Brenham, in the State of Texas; that the rate of freight upon flour via the defendant railway was 53 cents per 100 pounds from St. Louis to Brenham, and that the rate via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway was 40 cents per 100 pounds, and that the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway, upon the receipt of the flour from the appellee’s agent, promised and contracted, as evidenced by the bill of lading delivered to said agent, to carry said flour to Brenham, Texas, via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe road, and to charge therefor 40 cents per 100 pounds, and that said flour was in fact carried by said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway to Corsicana, Texas, and there delivered to its other connecting line in the State of Texas, the defendant-company; and that defendant did carry said flour, within a reasonable time and in good order and condition, to the city of Brenham, and duly notified the consignee, the appellee, that the flour had reached its destination, and tendered same to appellee upon payment by him of the freight charges at the rate of 53 cents-per 100 pounds, which payment appellee declined to make, and tendered to defendant’s agent at Brenham the amount of the freight money agreed upon by his agent with the said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway, to-wit, the sum of $94.88, that being the amount of freight due, calculated at the rate of 40 cents per 100 pounds; and with said tender appellee exhibited his bill of lading and demanded the delivery to him of his goods, which demand was by the defendant company’s agent refused, and the said goods were held by defendant until the 8th day of February, 1890, when appellee paid the sum of money demanded by defendant, to-wit, the sum of $1-25.72, and received said flour from defendant. And the evidence further shows, that the said cargo of flour was, when received by defendant at Corsicana, marked and way-billed for Brenham via defendant’s railway, and not marked and way-billed via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway; and there is no evidence ■ that defendant knew of the contract for shipment via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway. These facts show that the flour was interstate commerce, and that the defendant company and its connecting line, the said St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company, were common carriers engaged in carrying interstate freight, and were answerable to the laws of Congress regulating interstate traffic. Norfolk v. Railway, 136 U. S., 114, and act of Congress entitled “An act to regulate commerce,” approved in 1887, and its amendments. By the act of Congress above recited, such carriers who agree upon rates of freight over their lines are required to publish the rates, and to deliver copies of same to the Interstate Railway Commission; and after said rates are so established and continuing in force, any such carrier, or the agent or servant of such carrier, who receives or demands either less or more freight than that previously agreed, on and established, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction is subject to fine and imprisonment. By the statute of Texas (Act of May 6, 1882), any railroad company, its officers, agents, or employes, that shall refuse to deliver to the owner, agent, or consignee any freight, goods, wares, and merchandise, upon the payment or tender of payment of the freight charges shown by the bill of lading, shall be liable in damages to the owner of said freight, goods, and merchandise to an amount equal to the amount of the freight charges for every day said goods, wares, and merchandise may be held after payment or tender of payment of the charges due, as shown by the bill of lading. This act has been declared by our Supreme Court to be an exercise of the police power of the State, and that it is not in conflict with the Federal Constitution. Railway v. Dwyer, 75 Texas, 578-583. ' Such being the law, the penalty imposed by the statute might be recovered from a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce. Had the goods of appellee been shipped by the contracting railway company, as it promised and agreed to do, via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway, at the rate of 40 cents per 100 pounds, said rate having been previously agreed upon and established by said companies, and the said Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Company had refused to deliver his goods to appellee upon payment or tender of payment by him to said company of the freight charges as specified in the bill of lading, we have no doubt the appellee might recover the penalty imposed by the statute from said last named company. But the question for our decision is not whether the law be in conflict with the Federal Constitution, and therefore void, but the question is, can the law be enforced when it demands of a common carrier employed in transporting interstate commerce the doing of that which he is forbidden to do by the laws of Congress, under the penalty of fine and imprisonment? To state this question, it seems to us, is to answer in the negative. A law of Congress, itself constitutional, is paramount to any State law, when the provisions of the latter are antagonistic to those of the former. We therefore conclude that it is immaterial whether the defendant company knew or did not know at the time it received the flour consigned to appellee that the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway had contracted with appellee to transport his merchandise at the rate of 40 cents per 100 pounds. The defendant was required by the statute of this State to receive the cars of roads connecting with it, and under its contract with said connecting railway the defendant was under obligation to carry freight tendered by said line at an agreed rate, and that rate neither the defendant nor the company delivering the goods to defendant could change except by violating the Federal statute. Under such circumstances, we do not think the defendant company could be said to adopt and ratify the bill of lading, if it received the goods with knowledge that the railway company tendering them had contracted with appellee to transport said goods at 40 cents per 100 pounds. And unless the evidence shows that the carrier refusing to deliver goods to the consignee upon payment or tender of payment of the freight specified in the bill of lading, either executed the bill of lading or ratified it, no recovery can be had under the statute. Dwyer v. Railway, 75 Texas, 572. We think the trial court erred in the application of the law to the facts of the case, and that the law was substantially presented in instructions one and two requested by appellant’s counsel. In answer to the contention of appellee, that the defendant should not be permitted to challenge the binding force upon defendant of the bill of • lading, except under a plea of non est factum, it is sufficient to say that ■ plaintiff’s petition does not charge that the defendant executed the bill"" of lading, or that defendant authorized any one to execute same for defendant, nor does it charge that there was a partnership between defendant and the railway company which executed the bill of lading. In the case cited by appellee’s counsel (Railway v. Tisdale, 74 Texas, 8) the petition charged the existence of a partnership between the defendant company and the connecting railway companies. Delivered December 15, 1892. For the error above indicated, our judgment is that the judgment of the lower court be reversed and that the cause be remanded for another trial in accordance with the law as enunciated in this opinion. Mevet'sed and remanded. Chief Justice Garrett did not sit in this ease.","Charles Dillingham, Receiver of Houston & Texas Central Railway Company, v. Joseph Fischl. No. 34. 1. Suit for Penalty for Refusal to Deliver Freight. — A St. Louis milling company shipped to appellee, at Brenham, a car load of flour, the bill of lading for which (issued by the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway) showed that the rate of freight was 40 cents per 100 pounds, and that it was to be sent via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway. The schedule rate on flour to Brenham via the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway was 40 cents per 100 pounds, and via Houston & Texas Central Railway was 53 cents per 100 pounds. The flour came by the Houston & Texas Central Railway, which refused to deliver it unless the 53 cents rate was paid. Held, the penalty provided by statute for a failure to deliver merchandise upon tender or payment of freight charges shown by the bill of lading, can not, in this case, be enforced against the Houston & Texas Central Railway. 2. Offer by Shipper to Pay Difference in Freight Charge. — Evidence offered by the appellant, that the milling company offered to hold appellee harmless, and to pay the difference between the 40 and 53 cents rate, was inadmissible. If the appellant was liable for the penalty, appellee could not be deprived of his right to recover it by the willingness of a third party to pay the difference. Had this difference been paid by the shipper, and then the goods tendered to the consignee upon payment of the remainder, it may be that from the time of such tender he would have been relieved from liability, but appellee was under no obligation to assist him in relieving himself from liability that he had or might thereafter incur. 3. Conflict of Law — Act of Congress and State Statute. — The act of Congress requires that the schedule of rates be agreed upon and published, and denounces penalties upon any carrier who receives more or less than schedule rates. The State statute provides that any carrier who shall refuse to deliver freight upon tender or payment of the freight charges shown by the bill of lading, shall be liable for an amount equal to the freight charges for each day’s delay. This State law demands that the carrier should do a thing that is forbidden by a constitutional law of Congress, and that law is paramount to any State law when the provisions of the latter are antagonistic to those of the former. 4. Notice of Contract to Ship at a Particular Rate. — It is immaterial whether the defendant company knew or did not know that the receiving carrier had contracted to transport the freight at 40 cents per 100 pounds. It was- required by statute to receive the cars of connecting roads, and under its contract with the connecting road was under obligation to carry its freight at an agreed rate, which rate could not be changed except by violating the Federal statute. Therefore it could not be said to have adopted and ratified the 40 cents bill of lading, even if it knew that that was the rate agreed on. 5. What Companies Liable for Penalty. — Unless the evidence shows that the company refusing to deliver the freight to the consignee upon payment or tender of the specified rate of freight either executed the bill of lading or ratified it, no recovery can be had under the statute. 6. Non Est Factum. — Plaintiff’s petition does not charge that the defendant executed the bill of lading, or authorized any one to execute the same, nor that there was a partnership between the defendant and the company that executed the bill of lading, and therefore a plea of non est factum was not necessary before defendant could challenge its binding force upon him. Appeal from Washington. Tried below before Hon. C. C. Garrett. O. T. Holt, for appellant. 1. The court erred in not permitting defendant to prove that the milling company offered to pay the difference between the 40 and 53 cents rate. Brandon v. Manfg. Co., 51 Texas, 121. 2. If the established schedule rate via the Houston & Texas Central Railway was 53 cents per 100 pounds, appellant, under the act of Congress, could receive neither more nor less. Act of Congress entitled “An act to regulate commerce,” and amendments thereto; Railway v. Illinois, 118 U. S., 558; Hall v. De Cuir, 95 U. S., 485; Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, 114 U.

Rep., 709; Baird v. Railway, 41 Fed. Rep., 592; McCall v. People, 136 U. S., 104; Railway v. Pennsylvania, 136 U. S., 114. Searcy & Garrett, for appellee. 1. The contract of shipment was a through bill of lading made between the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company and the appellee, and he was justified under the law in demanding his legal rights under the contract, and could not be made to rely upon the mere promise of indemnity from a third and irresponsible party and stranger to the matter in controversy. Railway v. Ragsdale, 67 Texas, 24; Warren v. Frederichs, 76 Texas, 647; Bullock v. Smith, 72 Texas, 545; 1 Greenl. Ev., sec. 193. 2. The appellee’s suit was founded upon a written contract for shipment of the goods, alleged to have been executed by the proper authority of the St. Louis, Arkansas & Texas Railway Company, and its connecting lines, the appellant’s road being one, and the appellant’s adoption of said contract with full knowledge of its terms, thereby voluntarily forming a partnership with reference to the subject matter of the contract; and before appellent could challenge the genuineness or authority of said contract and its binding force on him, it devolved upon him to deny its genuineness or authority under oath. Railway v. Tisdale, 74 Texas, 8-16. 3. The statute of Texas is not a regulation of interstate commerce, but a simple exercise of the police power of the State, regulating the performance of a contract and providing a remedy for a breach thereof. The rate of 40 cents per 100 pounds from St. Louis, Missouri, to Brenham, Texas, was the lawful rate established under the act of Congress over the route contracted for in the bill of lading, and a delivery of the goods at that rate would not have violated that act.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellants sued appellees in the District Court of Leon County in trespass to try title, to recover 720 acres of land, a part of the M. Skinner league. Appellees pleaded not guilty and the statute of limitations. At the trial appellants showed that they were the heirs of B. R. Wallace, and proved a regular chain of title from the State to R. J. Towns. They then offered in evidence the following document, which had been duly recorded in Leon County: '""■The State of Texas, County of Travis. — Whereas, Benjamin R. Wallace and myself are the joint and equal owners of several tracts of land, situate in Leon County, in this State, viz., a league of land granted to Skinner, a league of land granted to Midkiff, and one-half of the league of land granted to Allen, which tracts are more particularly described in the deed of Nathaniel Robbins to me, on record in the County Court of Leon County; now, know all men by these presents, that I, Robert J. Towns, do by these presents authorize and empower the said Wallace to sell any portion of said land, not exceeding one-half thereof, and to make title thereof in our joint names and apply the proceeds thereof to his own use; the title to the purchaser to be made with special warranty. “ Witness my hand and scroll for seal, this 20th day of November, 1855. “R. J. Towns.” [Seal] Appellees objected to its admission in evidence; because, first, it was not a deed of conveyance; second, the recitals therein were not evidence against defendants, who rely on their possession, and are strangers thereto; third, it did not estop R. J. Towns, because not shown to have been acted upon. The court sustained the objections, and excluded the document, to which appellants duly excepted. Appellants also offered a deed from the tax collector of Leon County to Pruitt, one of the defendants, for part of the land in controversy, reciting a sale and conveyance of it as the property of “an unknown owner,” for the purpose of showing common source. This, upon objection that an unknown owner was not a common source, and that defendants relied upon their possession, was excluded. It was shown in connection with this Offer that' the defendants, except1 one, claimed under Pruitt. Thereupon judgment was rendered for appellees, the judge in his conclusions of law holding that the instrument did not connect appellants with the title shown to be in Towns. The appellees showed no title in themselves. From this judgment the present appeal is prosecuted, and the decisive question is, whether or not the instrument signed by Towns was sufficient to vest in Wallace title, legal or equitable, to an interest in the lands. Appellants contend that the recital of a joint legal ownership in Wallace estopped Towns, and was admissible to show the acquisition of his legal title to one-half by Wallace; and that even if such recital has not the effect of an estoppel, it is prima facie evidence of such acquisition of title, and therefore admissible. Appellants contend that the statement was only an ex liarte admission of Towns, not shown to have been acted upon, and not evidence against them; and that even if it estopped Towns, it could have no effect against strangers to the instrument. That the maker of a deed may be estopped to deny the truth of recitals therein, is a well settled doctrine of the common law. Says Greenleaf: “In regard to recitals in deeds, the general rule is, that all parties to a deed are bound by the recitals therein, which operate as an estoppel, working on the interest in the land if it be a deed of conveyance, and binding both parties and privies; privies in blood, privies in estate, and privies in law. Between such parties and privies the deed or other matter recited need not at any time be otherwise proved, the recital of it in the subsequent deed being conclusive. Thus the recital of a lease in a deed of release is conclusive evidence of the existence of the lease against the parties and all others claiming under them in privity of estate.” 1 Greenl. Ev., sec. 23. Bigelow, after tracing the history of the rule, and showing that it arose from the peculiar efficacy once given to an instrument by the use of a seal, and referring to modern legislation dispensing with the use of ""seals, says: “In such States the question of estoppel by statements and recitals in written instruments must depend upon intention, to be determined (from the writing itself) by the consideration whether the statement or recital was designed to furnish a basis of action by the parties; in other words, whether they intended to bind themselves, to contract, that the facts should be as stated.” Bige. on Estop., 269. “ Where the recital involves a contract, it estops; if it does not involve a contract, it operates only as a unilateral general admission, and is open to explanation. But a recital in-a deed, though not estopping, may make, •even against the heirs of the grantor, a prima facie case.” 2 Whart. Ev., sec. 1040. ' The general doctrine of estoppel arising from recitals in deeds, has been recognized by our Supreme Court. Hardy v. De Leon, 5 Texas, 243, 244; Williams v. Chandler, 25 Texas, 11. The instrument signed by Towns evidently came within the rules, above quoted from Bigelow and Wharton, for determining whether or not a particular recital works an estoppel against the grantor and his privies. It was evidently intended to “ furnish a basis for action” to Wallace, and “to contract” that the fact should be as stated; for the instrument proceeds, in view of the fact of joint ownership, to clothe Wallace with full lawful power to secure his interest out of the lands -by a sale, and the execution of joint conveyances by special warranty. The recital involved a contract with Wallace, which is stated by Wharton as the test by which its effect as an estoppel is to be determined. As against Towns, and all parties claiming under him, the instrument would therefore be admissible in evidence; and whether we hold that it would create against them an estoppel or not, it would certainly make a prima facie case. The case of Burk v. Turner, 79 Texas, 276, is referred to by both parties. In that case there was no general discussion of the doctrine of estoppel by deed. Both parties claimed under one who had conveyed to two persons a land certificate, reciting in his deed a complete chain of title to himself. The plaintiff proved no chain of title to this grantor, but relied on common source and the recital in the deed. The defendant, while holding title to one-half the land under this conveyance, also asserted that the common grantor had no chain of title, but that the title had remained in others, from whom such grantor claimed to have acquired it, and that as against them he (defendant) had perfected title by limitation. The court say: “The recital of a particular fact is at least evidence against the parties to the conveyance and their privies. It follows that the facts stated in the conveyance from Lane to George J. Turner and R. J. Turner were prima facie proved by the introduction in evidence of that conveyance as against the defendant, who received a deed and went into possession of the land under that title. The burden was then shifted upon the defendant, and in order to defeat the action it was incumbent upon him to show that the recital as to one or more of the conveyances was not true. The deed of Lane was evidence for him as well as against him; and if he had shown that either Ashby, the original grantee, Clare, Manifee, or Hodges had never transferred the certificate, and that he had acquired the title of either by the statute of limitation, he would have been entitled to a judgment, unless we should hold him estopped, which we are not now prepared to do.” The defendant had failed to show these facts, and judgment was therefore against him. So this case does not, as we understand it, either reject or affirm the doctrine of estoppel by recitals in deeds. However, if the instrument from Towns to Wallace was admissible against appellees at all, the decision of the question before us would be the same, whether it estopped Towns and his privies or was only prima facie evidence. It is clear that as against Towns and his heirs, and other parties holding under him, the instrument would have been admissible, and sufficient at least to make a prima facie case. But appellees claim that they were strangers to the document, and therefore not to be affected by it. The attitude in which the case stood when the paper was offered was this: The evidence showed legal title in Towns, with appellants seeking by this document to show that their ancestor had acquired title from or with him to an interest in it; and appellees, by their objection, standing on their possession and asserting the title to be still in Towns. Any transaction the effect of which would be to vest Towns’ title to the land or a part of it in appellants was, for the mere purpose of deraigning title, admissible, though it might appear to be entirely between Towns and Wallace, and although appellees may not have been parties to it. The mere fact that appellees would not be bound by such transaction would not render it inadmissible to prove title in appellants through Towns, for a deed of conveyance or a judgment between Wallace and Towns would not estop them unless they claimed under it. There is no doubt that the authorities all say that a recital in a deed does not estop strangers to it, but only parties and their privies in blood, in estate, or in law. Washburn, after stating this rule, adds: “ But a person in possession, sustaining his possession by no other title than a denial that a former owner had parted with his right, is not a stranger. He becomes privy in estate to him whose title he maintains, and is concluded by what destroys it in. his hands. For, if title can be traced by B to A, and B can fasten upon A the incapacity of asserting his right in consequence of his admission that he has conveyed to B, it is not just that one standing on A’s claim only, and relying on no superior right, should be permitted to contest the existence of a fact which those interested have settled.” 3 Washb. Real Prop., secs. 49, 50. He refers to Kinsman v. Loomis, 11 Ohio St., 478, and other authorities. Bigelow states the same proposition (Estoppel, p. 280), and refers to the same ease without criticism. In that case one of the deeds in plaintiff’s title recited the execution of another deed necessary to complete the chain. The deed thus recited was not otherwise shown. The defendants showed no paper title, but stood upon their possession, claiming, as do the appellees here, that the recital did not bind them, and did not, as against them, prove the former deed. But the court held that it did, and, after using the language above quoted from Washburn, adds: “ The law therefore wisely attaches the disability of A to all who maintain his title, and permits such estoppels to be used not merely defensively, but to sustain actions of ejectment. 2 Hill Abr., 401. “The present case affords a proper application of these rules. The sole defense consists in maintaining an outstanding title in Swift; but a fact is shown by Swift’s admission which proves this title has no existence, and that the estate has passed to plaintiff, an admission which binds not Swift only and his heirs and assignees, but all who seek protection under the shelter of his name.” 11 Ohio St., 479. These expressions are so applicable to this case and dispose so fully of the question before us, that we need add nothing to them. We do not wish to be understood as holding, however, that appellees are estopped by the recital in Towns’ deed from showing any defense to the action or any title to the land. We mean only to decide that the instrument can be used to deraign title from Towns. There is another view of that document which equally entitles appellants to use it as evidence. It recites that the subscriber and Wallace are the joint equal owners of the land, and the evidence as it stood at the trial shows that the absolute legal title was in Towns. The effect of the deed was therefore to acknowledge that Towns was holding the land to the extent of one-half in trust for Wallace. The instrument was good as an acknowledgment or declaration of a trust. “ There is no particular formality required or necessary in the creation of a trust, and the statute of frauds will be satisfied if the trust can be manifested or proved by any subsequent acknowledgment by the trustee, as by an express declaration, or any memorandum to that effect, or by letter under his hand, or by his answer in chancery, or b.y his affidavit, or by a recital in a bond or deed, or by a pamphlet written by the trustees.” 2 Perry on Trusts, sec. 82. “But if there is an absolute conveyance of the legal title to the supposed trustee, and there is no declaration of a trust prior to or at the time of the conveyance by the grantor, and the cestui que trust attempts to charge the grantee with a trust in respect to the land, he must produce some writing signed by the grantee of the legal title in order to charge him with the trust.” Perry on Trusts, sec. 83. Pomeroy (2 Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 1007) says: “When the trust is not created in and by the instrument of conveyance, it may be sufficiently declared and evidenced by the trustee to whom the land is conveyed or who becomes the holder of the legal title; and this may be done by a writing executed simultaneously with or subsequent to the conveyance, and such writing may be of the most informal nature.” Numerous illustrations of the doctrine, in adjudged cases, are given by these authors. The one most nearly in point, which we have examined, is in Insurance Company v. Campbell, 95 Illinois, 267, in which the holder of an absolute deed to land gave written notice, signed by her, that it in fact belonged to a named beneficiary. The court held this a sufficient declaration of the trust. Delivered November 3, 1892. We therefore conclude from these authorities,, that even if we should hold that by the deed the legal title to one-half the land did not pass from Towns to Wallace by estoppel, that instrument is still’ sufficient to show an equitable title in Wallace to such half, and that this would be sufficient to entitle appellants to recover, until appellees show some superior right. This mates it unnecessary to pass upon the ruling as to the tax deed: Had the deed from Towns to Wallace been properly excluded there would have been no reversible error in ruling out the tax deed. It did not show that defendants held under Towns; and if it had, appellants could not connect themselves with him without the instrument we have been considering. The rule as to common source had no application. No other facts were shown that would have given effect to the tax deed in appellants’ favor. Because of the error of the court in excluding the instrument from Towns to Wallace, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded. "" Reversed and remanded.","John R. Wallace et al. v. H. B. Pruitt et al. No. 19. 1. Estoppel by Written Instrument. — Appellants sued for 720 acres of land, part of the Skinner league, and showed that they were the heirs of B. B. Wallace, and proved a regular chain of title from the State to R. J. Towns, and then offered in evidence a document which had been duly recorded, of which the material parts are as follows: “ Whereas, Benjamin R. Wallace and myself are the joint and equal owners of a league of land granted to Skinner, more particular'.y described in the deed from Nathaniel Robbins to me, recorded in Leon County; now know all men by these presents, that I. Robert J. Towns, do by these presents authorize and empower the said Wallace to sell any portion of said laid, not exceeding half thereof, and to make title thereto in our joint names, and apply the proceeds thereof to his own use; the title to the purchaser to be nade with special warrantyHeld, the recitals in this instrument operate as an eitoppel upon Towns, and his privies in blood, estate, and law. 2. Construction of Instrument. — This instrument was evidently intended to furnish a “basis for action” to Wallace, and “to contract'’ that the fact should be as stated; for it proceeds, in view of the fact of joint ownership, to clothe IVallace with full power to secure his interest out of the lands by a sale and exscution of joint, conveyance. As against Wallace and all parties claiming under him it would be admissible in evidence, for whether it created an estoppd or not, it certainly made a prima facie case. 3. Effect of Recitals Against Strangers. — Appellees pleaded not guilty, and limitation. They showed no title in themselves, but claimed that the rejitals in the above instrument were not binding on them. When the paper was offered, the case stood thus: Legal title was in Towns, and appellants souglit by this document to show that their ancestor had acquired title from him to an interest in the league. Appellees stood on their possession, and asserted title to be still in Towns. Any transaction the effect of which would be to vest Towrs’ title in Wallace was. for the mere purpose of deraigning title, admissible, tiough it might appear to be entirely between Towns and Wallace. The merefact that appellees would not be bound by such transaction would not render i"". inadmissible to prove title. 4. Who are Strangers to the Title. — A person in possession, sustaining lis possession by no other title than a denial that a former owner had parted witt his right, is not a stranger. He becomes privy in estate to him whose title he naintains, and is concluded by what destroys it in his hands. Where the sole defense consists in maintaining an outstanding title, but an admission is shovn which proves that this title had no existence, but that the title has passed to plaintiff, such admission binds not only the heirs and assignees of the person making the admission, but all who seek protection under the shelter of his name. 5. Declaration of a Trust. — The absolute legal title being shown to be in Towns, the instrument was good as the declaration of a trust; that Towns was holding to the extent of one-half in trust for Wallace. There is no particular formality necessary in the creation of a trust, and the statute of frauds will be satisfied if the trust can be manifested by any subsequent acknowledgment by the trustee; therefore, even if we should hold that the legal title to one-half did not pass to Wallace by estoppel, the instrument is still sufficient to show an equitable title in Wallace to such half, entitling him to recover, until appellees show some superior right. 6. Common Source — Tax Deed. — A tax deed was shown to Pruitt for part of the laud, sold as the property of an unknown owner. It was properly excluded. It did not show that defendants held under Towns, and if it had. appellants could not connect themselves with him without the instrument we have been considering. The rule as to common source has no application. Appeal from Leon. Tried below before Hon. Norman G. Kittiiell. The opinion states the case. John R. Arnold, for appellants. 1. ' R. J.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. The appellee instituted suit against appellant for the recovery of damages sustained by him, as alleged, from the negligence of appellant in failing to deliver promptly the following telegram, addressed by S. E. Allen to appellee: “ How many beeves and bulls have you ? Don’t go away. Will get them off. Answer.” The message was dated May 11, 1891, and was on same day, after nightfall, delivered to appellant’s operator at Harrisburg, in Harris County, with written request from the sender that it be sent at once to appellee at Stafford’s Point, where appellee was at the time holding a herd of cattle, while Allen was negotiating for their sale in the city of Houston. The cattle had been gathered for the purpose of delivering them to one who had contracted for them, but who had failed to comply with his contract. The plaintiff continued to hold the cattle until the 13th of May, 1891, on which day, not having heard from Allen, he turned the cattle loose, and went himself to Houston, and there learned that the cattle had been sold, the purchaser agreeing to pay $14 a head for the beeves and $10 for for the bulls. The evidence shows that plaintiff called several times at the telegraph office at Stafford’s Point before he turned the cattle loose, and inquired if there was a telegram for him from Houston, and was told that there was not. It also appears that the operator, prior to his receipt of the telegram, was advised by the plaintiff that he was there for the purpose of selling and shipping his herd of cattle, and that he was expecting a telegram from Houston in regard to the shipment. The telegram was never delivered to plaintiff. The operator at Stafford testified, that he could not say whether he received the telegram on the 12th or 13th of May, but that he received it the same day that plaintiff turned his cattle loose and left for Houston; that he received it about 12 or 1 o’clock, and he immediately dispatched a messenger to the prairie with the telegram to be delivered to plaintiff, and the messenger returned without finding the plaintiff. When plaintiff arrived in Houston he interviewed the appellant’s manager there in relation to the telegram which had been delivered to the operator at Harrisburg on the 11th day of May, with instructions to send to plaintiff at Stafford’s Point, and the manager informed plaintiff that for two days the operator at Houston had been calling the operator-at Stafford’s Point, but had been unable to obtain a response, and the manager supposed that the absence of the operator from his post was the reason why plaintiff had not received the telegram. By his not receiving the telegram, the plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity of completing the sale of his cattle which Allen had negotiated for him. The plaintiff had in his herd about 178 beeves and 45 bulls. The bulls, as an indispensable preparation for shipment to market, had been dehorned, as bulls with their horns could not be shipped to market. The plaintiff upon the trial was permitted to show that the bulls with horns sawed off, in May, and turned upon the range in that section of the State, would suffer from flies, and that the probability was that not more than two-thirds of their number would survive the summer. The plaintiff was also allowed to show that it cost him $225 to collect and hold the herd at Stafford’s; there was evidence that plaintiff owned some of the bulls, and that he bought some of them, for which he paid $5 a head. There was a verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $500; and a motion for a new trial being overruled, defendant appealed. Several errors are assigned by the appellant, all of which may be considered under two heads: First. The message did not on its face apprise the operator at Harrisburg that loss or damage would probably result to the vendee if the message was not promptly received by him, nor was there any extrinsic evideuce that the operator was informed of the nature and object of the telegram, and the necessity for its prompt delivery. Second. That if the defendant be liable in damages for failure to deliver the message, the plaintiff can not recover the damages sued for, because the same are remote and speculative, and are not such as naturally result from breach of appellant’s contract to deliver the message. The damages for which a party may recover for a breach of contract are such as ordinarily and naturally flow from its nonperformance. This has been a rule of law recognized by both English and American courts since the decision of the well known case of Hadley v. Baxendale, 9 Exch., 341, and the application of this rule to the case now under consideration restricts the plaintiff’s right of recovery to the difference between the market value of his cattle and the price he would have obtained for them had he been able to deliver them under the contract negotiated for him by his agent in the city of Houston. We think, therefore, the court erred in permitting the plaintiff to show the cost incurred by him in gathering and holding the cattle at Stafford’s Point, and also his probable loss of bulls. For this error the cause must be reversed. The plaintiff, in addition to nominal damages, will be entitled to recover, as we have said, the difference between the value of his cattle at Stafford’s Point in the condition they were in while on the land and the price he was to have received under the contract made by his agent, less the cost of transportation of the cattle to Houston, if the contract required that they be delivered in Houston. To authorize a recovery for other than nominal damages from a telegraph company for failure to deliver promptly a message received by its operator for transmission over its wires, when the sender gives no explanation to the operator to whom the message is delivered of its nature and purpose, the message itself must upon its face advise the operator that it is in reference to a transaction from which loss or injury will probably result to the sender or him to whom it is sent, if the message is not promptly delivered. When we consider that in all telegraphic communications the utmost brevity of expression is cultivated, we are of the opinion that the message delivered to the operator on the 11th of May at Harrisburg, to be sent to the plaintiff at Stafford’s Point, does of itself advise the operator that it relates to a matter of business in which loss will probably result to either the sender or the plaintiff if the message is not promptly delivered; and if the failure to deliver the message to the plaintiff was the proximate cause of his not reaping the benefit of the contract of sale made for him by the sender of the message, the appellant is liable for such damages as naturally flow from the breach of cbntract. It would be an unreasonable rule (as seems to be contended for by the appellant) to hold, that to make the telegraph company liable for failure to deliver the message, the operator must have been made acquainted with both the terms of the contract and the parties to it. Such a rule would, in our judgment, not only be unreasonable, b.ut inconsistent, with the uses and purposes of the telegraph. The judgment of the lower court is reversed and remanded. Beversed and remanded. Delivered March 30, 1893.","Western Union Telegraph Company v. Frank J. Williford. No. 124. 1. Notice of Importance of Message.—To authorize recovery of other than nominal damages for failure to deliver a message promptly, when the sender gives no explanation of its importance, it must upon its face advise the operator that it is in reference to a matter out of which loss or injury will probably result. “How many beeves and bulls have you? Don’t go away. Will get them off,” is a message that gives such notice. The operator need not be made acquainted both with the terms of the contract and the parties to it. 2. Measure of Damages.—If there was failure to make sale of a herd of cattle caused by the nondelivery of a message, the measure of damages is the difference between the market value of the cattle in the condition they were in while in the herd, and the price the owner would have obtained for them had he been able to deliver them under the contract, deducting the cost of transportation if the contract required them to be delivered. The plaintiff should not have been permitted to prove the cost of collecting and holding them, nor the probable loss on bulls from dehorning them. Appeal from Harris. Tried below before Hon.

"KEY, Associate Justice. The court below sustained a general demurrer to the plaintiff’s petition; and he having declined to amend, judgment was rendered dismissing the suit, from which judgment this writ of error is prosecuted. There are three assignments of error, each raising the only question for this court to consider, which is the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s petition as against a general demurrer. This petition (omitting certain formal parts) is as follows: ‘ ‘ That plaintiff is a resident citizen of the city of St. Louis, State of Missouri, and that the Western Union Telegraph Company is a private corporation, duly incorporated under and by virtue of the laws of the State of New York, with Jay Gould as president thereof, and said Western Union Telegraph Company has for the last ten years continually held itself out as a telegraph company, and offered as such to receive and transmit messages from any point on its line to any other point thereon, which said points on its line do now and for ten years last past have embraced Belton and Austin in the State of Texas and St. Louis in the State of Missouri; which said business was carried on in consideration of the payment received therefor and the profits arising therefrom, and said defendant during said period of time has held itself as authorized and ready to do said business. “Plaintiff further alleges, that on, to-wit, the 16th day of February, A. D. 1884, he was associated with John Martin in the mercantile business in the city of St. Louis in the State of Missouri, under the firm name and style of Edward Martin & Co., and that they then and there held a claim, which was just and equitable, against Samuel T. Woodworth, of Belton, Bell County, Texas, amounting to the sum of $1575.80, all of which was due and payable excepting $655.65, which would become due and payable on March 4, 1884. That said Samuel T. Woodworth was then in failing circumstances and was about to be attached by other creditors on the 16th day of February, A. D. 1884, when Montieth & Furman, attorneys at law, of Belton, Texas, and who then and there were acting for said firm of Edward Martin & Co. at their request and as under their employment, prepared a dispatch to James P. Maginn, attorney at law, at St. Louis, Missouri, and who was then and there the attorney of said firm of Edward Martin & Co. in St. Louis, Missouri, and delivered the same at 2 o’clock and 45 minutes p. m. on February 16, A. D. 1884, to the Frontier Telegraph Company, and which was immediately received and transmitted by said Frontier Telegraph Company to the Western Union Telegraph Company, and by it received at 2 o’clock and 45 minutes p. m. on February 16, A. D. 1884, as first written, and sent and transmitted by it to James P. Maginn at St. Louis, State of Missouri. Plaintiff alleges, that said dispatch read as follows, or substantially as follows, and so read at the time when it came into the hands of defendant herein for transmission: “ Belton, Texas, February 16, 1884. “ ‘James P. Maginn, St. Louis, Mo.: “ ‘ Martin & Co. hold note of Sam. Woodworth; will be attached tonight; your bank telegraph Miller Brothers, bankers, to make bond. “ ‘ 22 collect. 2:45 p. m. Monteith & Furman.’ “ Plaintiff alleges, that by the negligence and carelessness of defendant, its agents and employes, the message was not delivered on that day nor on the succeeding day, but was carelessly and negligently withheld from said James P. Maginn, and he had no notice of the matters referred to-until the 18th day of February, A. D. 1884. Plaintiff alleges, that if said message had been transmitted with proper skill and reasonable rapidity it would have come to the hands of James P. Maginn by 3 o’clock p. m. of the 16th day of February, 1884, and then been by him communicated to Edward Martin & Co., and reply received by said James P. Maginn, and been by him or said Edward Martin & Co., or some good or solvent bank of St. Louis, Mo., answered, either by telegraphing Miller & Brothers or some one else who could have obtained the execution of a good and sufficient bond for attachment which would have been approved by the district clerk of Bell County, Texas, which said answer of said telegram should have been obtained and transmitted by said Western Union Telegraph Company and received by the person to whom the same was sent by 6 o’clock p. m. on the 16th day of February, 1884; and plaintiff alleges, that by the use of reasonable promptness on the part of said Western Union Telegraph Company and by the use of reasonable promptness by James P. Maginn and said Edward Martin & Co., which would have been executed, and by reasonable promptness on the part of said Western Union Telegraph Company in transmitting said replying message from St. Louis, Mo., to Belton, Texas, such answer could and should have been returned by 6 o’clock p. m., February 16, 1884; but plaintiff alleges, that if the same had been received by 8 or even 10 o’clock p. in. of February 16, 1884, the same would have been in time for said Martin & Co. to have saved their indebtedness by obtaining a writ of attachment. And plaintiff alleges, that said Monteith & Furman had prepared a petition, which was°in due form, and an affidavit for attachment in blank, which could, upon getting a telegram, be quickly closed and completed, and Miller Brothers, bankers, of Belton, Texas, had promised upon obtaining an authorizing telegram from some good and solvent bank to go upon said attachment bond as security thereon, and A. M. Monteith stood ready to make affidavit such as is required by law upon which an attachment should issue; and arrangements had been made with the clerk of the District Court of Bell County to stand read)7 to issue writ of attachment and approve bond in legal form and with approved security, which could and would have been readily made if a proper answer had been made to said telegram which had been promptly returned to Belton. And plaintiff alleges, that he stood ready and willing to answer said telegram, and could readily and promptly have provided an attachment bond through a good and reliable bank in St. Louis, Mo., who would have telegrahed Miller Brothers to make bond for Edward Martin, and the said bank would save said Miller Brothers from all loss and damage whatever. “And plaintiff alleges, that until 11 o’clock p. m. on the 16tli day of February, A. D. 1884, there were sufficient goods, wares, and merchandise of Samuel T. Woodworth subject to attachment to satisfy the debt, interest, and cost of suit, which would have been recovered by judgment from Samuel T. Woodworth at the suit of Edward Martin & Co., and which would have been duly collected by such attachment and judgment of the court; and plaintiff further alleges, that suit would have been instituted, and the goods of Samuel T. Woodworth sufficient to satisfy said indebtedness of Edward Martin & Co. attached, and said indebtedness of Samuel T. Woodworth fully paid and discharged, and that there was good and legal grounds for the issuance of said writ of attachment for such purpose. And plaintiff further alleges, that the nature and purpose of such dispatch, as revealed upon the face thereof, were sufficient to put the said Western Union Telegraph Company upon notice of the importance of such dispatch being promptly and correctly forwarded to said James P. Maginn, in order that the indebtedness therein referred to might be saved or secured, but that defendant, although it had such knowledge by its officers and agents for receiving, transmitting, and delivering, did so carelessly and negligently, so that a mistake was made in the transmitting and delivery of such message, and said message was not delivered until two days after it should have been, to plaintiff’s great damage, he now being the owner of such claim, in the sum of $3000. “And plaintiff further alleges, that said Edward Martin & Co., in reply to said telegram to James P. Maginn, would also have telegraphed to Monteith & Furman a statement of the amount of their claim against Samuel T. Woodworth, and also a statement as to when the same would become due, for the instruction of said Monteith & Furman as to filling in their allegation in their petition of Edward Martin & Co. v. Samuel T. Woodworth, and affidavit for writ of attachment and bond for attachment to said cause. And plaintiff alleges, that said Sam. T. Woodworth since the 16tli day of February, A. D. 1884, has been insolvent and no sum of money could be made out of him by process of law, and said Samuel T. Woodworth would not willingly pay anything on such indebtedness. “ Plaintiff further alleges, that said firm of Edward Martin & Co. prior to the institution of this suit was dissolved, and the claim of Edward Martin & Co. against the Western Union Telegraph Company was duly assigned and transferred for a valuable consideration to plaintiff herein and is now his property, and he now sues upon the same in his own name. And plaintiff alleges, that answer to said dispatch ought to have been received at Belton, Texas, by 6 o’clock p. m. of February 16, 1884. Plaintiff further alleges, that he gave due notice as required by law and regulations of the Western Union Telegraph Company of the loss and injury which was occasioned to said Edward Martin & Co., and within the time prescribed by the rules and regulations of said Western Union Telegraph Company, which company refused to pay and satisfy the same in whole or in part; and plaintiff alleges, that plaintiff paid toll for transmission of said message to St. Louis, Missouri, the sum of $1.35, which has not been returned to plaintiff. “ Wherefore, the premises considered, plaintiff prays that defendant be duly cited to appear and answer this petition, and that on final hearing plaintiff have judgment for said sum of $3000 damages caused to him, and for his toll paid $1.35, and for such other and further relief as plaintiff may in law and in equity be entitled to, and as in duty bound, and will ever pray,” etc. It is contended by defendant in error that the demurrer to the petition was properly sustained, because: 1. The petition charged a breach of contract with the Frontier Telegraph Company, and seeks to hold defendant in error liable therefor. 2. Unless there was a limitation to the contract by which the company restricted its liability to its line, or some statute controlled this, the Frontier Telegraph Company’s contract will be construed to bind it to deliver the message to the addressee.. 3. Plaintiff in error was neither the sender nor addressee of the message. 4. The petition showed too many contingencies to happen after a prompt delivery of the message before plaintiff could have secured his debt. As to the first of these propositions, the petition alleges that Monteith <Jr Furman delivered the message to the Frontier Telegraph Company and that it immediately transmitted it to defendant in error; that the latter received it and sent and transmitted it to Maginn at St. Louis, etc. Whether the Frontier Telegraph Company is to be considered in delivering the message to defendant in error as its agent or as the agent of the senders is not material; but when the defendant received and undertook to transmit the message, it rested under the implied obligation to do so with the same diligence and expedition as if it had expressly agreed to transmit it. The facts alleged show an implied contract. Concerning the second proposition, if we are correct in holding that the allegations of the petition show an implied contract by the defendant in error to properly transmit the message, it follows necessarily that it is liable for any breach on its part of such contract. It has been ’held in New York, that in the absence of a special agreement or arrangement either with the sender of the message or between the connecting lines, the company on whose line the default resulting in loss occurs is the proper party to be sued. Baldwin v. Tel. Co., 45 N. Y. (6 Hand), 744. With reference to the third contention, it is true that the message was sent by Monteith & Furman, but the petition avers that they were acting for Edward Martin & Co., and the message itself shows that it was intended for their benefit. It discloses the fact that they held a claim against Woodworth that was in peril. It has been held in this State, that where one person, for a valuable consideration, agrees to pay a debt owing by the other party to the contract to a third person, that such third person, though not a party to the contract, can maintain an action thereon. Spann v. Cochran & Ewing, 63 Texas, 240. The contract being for their benefit, we think Martin & Co. had a right to sue; and having transferred their cause of action to plaintiff in error, he can maintain an action thereon. Nor do we concur with defendant in error in its fourth proposition, that the damages are too remote and contingent. The message was sufficient on its face to indicate to defendant that Martin & Co. held a pecuniary claim against Woodworth, that there was danger of its loss through the insolvency of the debtor, and that prompt delivery of the message was necessary to avert such loss. Such being the case, if defendant in error was guilty of negligence, as charged in the petition, in the transmission of the message, and if as a result of such negligence Martin & Co. lost their debt, then upon sound principles of law and justice plaintiff in error is entitled to recover from defendant in error the full amount of such debt. Tel. Co. v. Sheffield, 71 Texas, 570; Parks v. Tel. Co., 13 Cal., 422. Of course, before plaintiff in error can recover he must produce such testimony as will induce the court or jury trying the case to believe with reasonable certainty that if the message had been promptly transmitted and delivered to the addressee, Martin & Co. would have obtained an attachment against Woodworth, and thereby secured their debt. The petition alleges that they would have done so. Delivered October 19, 1892. Our conclusion is, that as against a general demurrer the petition is good, and the judgment must be reversed and cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","THIRD DISTRICT, OCTOBER, 1892. Edward Martin v. Western Union Telegraph Company. No. 1. 1. Liability of Telegraph Company for Failure to Forward Dispatch. — A telegraph company receiving a dispatch from a connecting line is under the implied obligation to forward it with the same diligence and care as if it had expressly agreed to transmit it. So, whether the company delivering the message is agent of the sender or of the company receiving it. 2. Same. — The telegraph company receiving a dispatch from a connecting line is liable for damages caused by its want of diligence and expedition in transmitting and delivering the message. 3. Same — Liability of Connecting Telegraph Lines. — Where a message is sent over connecting telegraph lines, any one of such lines causing injury by its default is liable, and is the proper party to be sued. 4. Message Sent by Agent — Principal may Sue. — Attorneys in interest of their client sent a message by telegraph. The client, being damaged by the negligent failure of the telegraph company to deliver the message with proper dispatch, has cause of action against the telegraph company guilty of the failure. 5. Notice by Contents of Telegraph Message. — The dispatch following: “Belton, Texas, Feb. 16,1884. James P. Maginn, St. Louis, Mo.: — Martin & Co. hold note of Sam. Woodworth; will be attached to-night; your bank telegraph Miller Bros., bankers, to make bond. [Signed] Monteitb & Furman,’’ on its face indicated to the telegraph company that Martin & Co. held a money obligation against Woodworth in danger of being lost through his insolvency: and of the necessity of the prompt delivery of the message to prevent the loss of the debt. 6. Assignee of Claim for Damages may Sue. —Claim for damages to a firm was assigned to a member; in such case the assignee could maintain suit for such damages. 7. Cause of Action. — See petition held sufficient if sustained by testimony to support a claim against the telegraph company for failure to deliver a dispatch with due promptness, whereby a debt was lost ,by the plaintiff in whose behalf the message was sent. Error from Bell. Tried below before Hon. W. A. Blackburn. Montieth & Furman and J. P. Maginn, for plaintiff in error. 1. The demurrer should have been overruled, as plaintiff was entitled to nominal damages at least, the demurrer admitting the defendant’s alleged negligence in failing to transmit and deliver the message within a reasonable time to the agent of plaintiff. “A telegraph company, in.the performance of its contract, is under an obligation to communicate with reasonable speed to the person addressed the intelligence which it receives from its employer, and it is liable for a negligent delay, or, a fortiori, for a total failure in doing so.” Gray on Com. by Tel., sec. 22, citing the following cases: On negligent delay in placing the intelligence on the lines.

Co. v. Drvburg, 35 Pa. St., 298; Daniel v. Tel. Co., 61 Texas, 456. 2. Plaintiff had a right to sue the defendant, on whose line the negligence is alleged to have occurred, and was not restricted, as was the opinion of the District Court in this case, to the Frontier Telegraph Company, which first got the message, and promptly and correctly transmitted same to defendant, who undertook its further transmission and delivery. Stevenson v. Tel. Co., 16 U. C. Q. B., 530; Leonard v. Tel. Co., 41 N. Y., 544; Squire v. Tel. Co., 98 Mass., 232; Baldwin v. Tel. Co., 45 N. Y., 744; Tel. Co. v. Carew, 15 Mich., 525; Gray on Com. by Tel., secs. 58, 59. The only case seemingly adverse to this proposition is Thurn v. Telegraph Company, 15 California, 472, and that arose under a penal statute, and was held therefore subject to a strict construction. 3. Under the rule laid down in Hadley v. Baxindale, 9 Exchequer, 341, 354, approved by this court repeatedly, and notably in Telegraph Company v. Edsall, 63 Texas, 668; discussed and approved in Gray on Communication by Telegraph, section 80, and amplified and applied in Telegraph Company v. Bertram & Mueller, 1 Court of Appeals Civil Cases, 654, plaintiff is entitled to the amount of the claim lost through the defendant’s negligence, the message notifying the company of the nature of the business to be done. ‘ ‘All that the law required to fix the company for actual damages resulting directly and proximately from the nondelivery of the message was notice to the company, in a general way, of the business to which the message related and the purpose to which it was intended to contribute.” Tel. Co. v. McKinney, 2 Ct. App. C. C., 565; Gray on Com. by Tel., sec. 82, and cases cited. In Parks v. Telegraph Company, 13 California, 422, there'was almost precisely a similar state of facts to those in this case, and the plaintiff's loss of his debt was adjudged the proximate and natural damage from the defendant’s failure to transmit the message. Gray on Com. by Tel., sec. 84; Tel. Co. v. Harris, 19 Ill. App., 347; Thompson v. Tel. Co., 64 Wis., 531. Stemmons & Field, for defendant in error. 1. The petition alleged a breach of contract made with the Frontier Telegraph Company, and seeks to hold the defendant in error liable for its breach. De Rutte v. Tel. Co., 1 Daly, 547. 2. Unless there was a limitation to the contract, by which the company restricts its liability to its line, or some statute controlled this; the Froritier Telegraph Company’s contract will be construed to bind it to deliver the message to the addressee. 3. The plaintiff in error was neither the sender nor addressee of the message, and can not recover. Railway v. Levy, 59 Texas, 569; 6 Wait’s Act. and Def., 17; 2 Thomp. on Neg., 847. 4. The plaintiff’s pleading showed too many contingencies to happen after a prompt delivery of the message before plaintiff could have secured his debt."
"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Defendant in error, Mrs. Bryan, who was plaintiff below, owned a homestead situated at the corner of Main and Calhoun Streets in the city of Houston. When her homestead was improved in 1869, there was a ditch, known as “the city ditch,” kept open by the city, which ran along Calhoun Street, passing by her property, and which afforded sufficient drainage for that and the neighboring lands. Subsequently the city dug ditches along other streets above her property, which opened into the city ditch at right angles, thus conducting into it a volume of water larger than had formerly passed through it; too large, indeed, for its capacity as it was originally made. Weeds and rubbish were allowed to accumulate in the city ditch in the neighborhood of Mrs. Bryan’s property, and to gradually and materially diminish its depth, thus rendering it still less sufficient to carry off the water which concentrated there when there was copious rainfalls. The consequence was, that the water was impeded in the passage opposite to her house, backed up to the Main Street crossing, and there overflowed, running into her yard and house and damaging her. It sufficiently appears from the evidence, that by means of the other ditches which were opened into the city ditch, water was collected and emptied into it which would not otherwise have flowed through it, but would have passed off in other directions; and that because of this increase and the filling up of the city ditch, plaintiff’s property was overflowed at every rain of the duration of an hour or two. This overflowing of plaintiff’s property began six or seven years before the trial, and seems to have increased in magnitude up to the time this suit was brought. In the trial below, defendant having pleaded the statute of limitations, plaintiff was restricted in her recovery to such damages as she had sustained within two years next preceding the institution of this suit. She introduced evidence tending to show, that within that time, by the operation of the water which flowed into her house, a floor had rotted out which it cost her §120 or §125 to replace; that she and her young daughters had been made ill with chills and fever for about half the time, and had incurred from §200 to §300 as doctor’s bills; that bad odors had been generated, and that her house was rendered damp and uncomfortable for a large part of the time. There was evidence of much further damage, such as the destruction of garden, shrubbery, flowers, etc., and the rotting of other floors, but the time when it occurred and the .value of the things destroyed or injured are not shown. In view of the verdict, we find the foregoing facts to have been established. Quite a number of witnesses gave it as their opinion, that the overflows of plaintiff’s premises were not increased, but rather diminished by the ditch, and that her property was not injured but benefited by it. But facts to which other witnesses testified, if true, rendered it apparent that those opinions were based upon a partial conception of the question, and the jury was warranted in disregarding them. The city was not originally bound to furnish ditches or sewers for the purpose of draining plaintiff’s property of the surface water which naturally passed over it, and it was not therefore bound to keep open the ditch which it had dug, so long as it did not by its negligence increase- or divert the flow of such surface water to plaintiff’s injury. But when it collected water from other territory and concentrated it in this ditch, it was bound to provide sufficient outlet for it, so that it would not be forced upon plaintiff’s land in larger quantities than would have flowed over it without such act. The rule of law applicable in such cases is thus stated by Judge Dillon: “ There will be liability [of a. municipal corporation] if the direct effect of the work, particularly if it be a sewer or drain, is to collect an increased body of water and to precipitate it on the adjoining private property to its injury.” And further: “ There is municipal liability where the property of private persons is flooded, either directly or by water being set back, when this is the result of the negligent execution of the plan adopted for the construction of gutters, drains, culverts, or sewers, or of the negligent failure to keep the same in repair and free from obstruction; and this whether the lots are below the grade of the street or not.” Dill, on Mun. Corp., 1051; see, also, Gross v. Lampasas, 74 Texas, 195. It follows from this that the city was liable upon the facts above stated. The court gave the jury the following instructions, of which numbers 1 and 3 are assigned as error: “ 1. ""As to any injury resulting to plaintiff from overflow of city ditch, if any, you will find for plaintiff, if from the evidence you find such overflow was occasioned by reason of negligence in the city authorities charged with that duty in not maintaing such ditch in proper repair and condition. “ 2. If you find that plaintiff’s property was overflowed from Main Street, or from surface water flowing on it or on adjacent property not occasioned from said city ditch, then your verdict should be for defendant. “ 3. If you find from the evidence that plaintiff’s property has been damaged from overflow of the city ditch, if such overflow was-occasioned by reason of bad condition of said city ditch, by reason of weeds, etc., filling up, then you must confine your inquiries to such injuries received within two years next before filing this suit. And you will exclude any or all injuries or damages to plaintiff not occurring within two years next before September, 1890, for all such damages are barred by limitations and can not be allowed for.” These instructions are complained of as having been 11 calculated to impress the jury with the idea that it was the duty of the city authorities to maintain the ditch in such condition that its capacity would be sufficient to prevent an overflow of plaintiff’s premises from surface water, regardless of the question as to whether the ditch in its then condition was injurious to plaintiff or not.” The general charge was certainly quite vague and indefinite, and did not inform the jury as to the conditions upon which the liability of the city would depend. We think it is defective rather than positively erroneous. At the request of plaintiff the following instruction was given: “ If the jury believe from the evidence, that by means of the ditch in question surface water that would naturally have overflowed elsewhere was diverted in large quantities from its natural outlet and carried into the ditch, then if the evidence further shows that the defendant permitted the ditch to become and remain insufficient to carry off the water so collected in it, and that by reason thereof large quantities of water, diverted from its natural outlet, were thrown from said ditch upon the plaintiff’s premises, the plaintiff is entitled to recover such damages, if any, as resulted to her therefrom under the rules elsewhere given, and the jury shall so find.” And the court at defendant’s request charged as follows: “ Defendant can not be held liable for a mere neglect to provide ditches of sufficient capacity to properly drain the premises of the plaintiff; and if the overflows, if any, of the plaintiff’s premises were not caused by any direct act or omission on the part of defendant, or if said premises would have overflowed to as great an extent without the acts of the defendant complained of, then you will find for the defendant.” The rules upon which they were to rest their verdict were thus clearly given to the jury, and with the aid of these special charges there was no probability of a misunderstanding of the main charge. The other charge asked by defendant, so far as it is correct, was involved in that which was given. The effect upon the case of the two charges would be the same, except that the one which was not given was incorrect in one particular. It is as follows: “If you believe from the evidence, that notwithstanding the negligence, if any, of the city in failing to keep the ditch on Calhoun Street in proper repair and of sufficient capacity, the premises of the plaintiff 'have nevertheless been as well drained for the last two years as the same would have been had no ditch been there, you will find for the defendant.” It might be true that the premises have been as well drained for the last two years as the same would have been had not the city ditch been there, consistently with defendant’s liability. The other ditches had been opened into it more than two years before the trial, and while it may be conceded that this ditch, defective as it was, helped to carry off the water thus collected, and thereby drained the land as well or better than it would have been drained had it not been there, it by no means follows that it was sufficient to conduct away the increased flow which had been introduced into it since its original construction. Unless it was sufficient to do that, defendant was liable. The fourth assignment is too general. The fifth is, that the verdict is excessive. The verdict can not be sustained upon the proof of the killing of fruit trees, gardens, shrubbery, flowers, etc., because no statement was made of their value. The same is true as to the rotting of floors. The plaintiff could not recover the full cost of putting in a new floor, because the value of the old one was not entirely destroyed. The testimony of the plaintiff and of the doctor, taken together, did, however, establish as well as can be required the facts, that plaintiff was made sick, that her health was gradually undermined, and that she was exposed to bad odors and discomforts and to much inconvenience, resulting from the flooding of her house, and that her bills incurred to Dr. Burroughs alone amounted in one year to 8200 or $300. As we understand his evidence, he attributes these bills to the sickness resulting from the causes assigned. In view of these facts, we can not say that the jury was not warranted in finding a verdict for plaintiff, nor that the amount they awarded, $675, is excessive. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 23, 1893.","The City of Houston v. Mary A. Bryan. No. 118. 1. City Drainage—Liability for Overflow. — The city was not originally bound to furnish ditches or sewers for the purpose of draining plaintiff’s property; but when it collected water from other territory and concentrated it in the ditch which it had dug along the street in front of plaintiff’s property, it was bound to provide sufficient outlet for it. so that it would not be forced upon plaintiff’s land in larger quantities than would have flowed over it without such act. 2. Charge Approved.—If the jury believe from the evidence that by means of the ditch in question, surface water that would naturally have overflowed elsewhere was diverted in large quantities from its natural outlet and carried into the ditch, then if the evidence further shows that the defendant permitted the ditch to become and remain insufficient to carry off the water so collected in it, and that by reason thereof large quantities of water, diverted from its natural outlet, were thrown from said ditch upon the plaintiff's premises, the plaintiff is entitled to recover such damages, if any, as resulted to her therefrom. 3. Defective Charge.—See opinion for charge asked by defendant held to be defective. 4. Verdict not Excessive.—The testimony of the plaintiff and the doctor taken together established, as well as can be required, the fact that plaintiff was made sick, and that her health was gradually undermined, and that she was exposed to bad odors and discomforts, and to much inconvenience resulting from the flooding of her house, and that her bills incurred to one doctor alone amounted in one year to $200 or $300; and as we understand his evidence he attributes these bills to sickness resulting from the causes assigned; therefore a verdict for $075 was not excessive.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. By this suit appellant, as the nonresident owner of a large body of land in Borden County, sought to enjoin the collection of the tax levied and assessed against said land for the year 1891, by the proper officers of Borden County. A preliminary injunction was granted, and afterward upon final hearing was dissolved; hence this appeal. The case was tried before the court without a jury, on an agreed state.ment of facts, about which there is no controversy, and upon which the district judge filed separate conclusions of law and fact. From these conclusions and the agreed statement, it appears, that Borden County was duly organized on the 17th day of March, 1891, and that her duly elected officers qualified on April 1, 1891, at which last named date the tax assessor of Howard County, to which Borden had been up to that time attached for judicial purposes, had not begun to assess the taxable property of the latter county. That the assessor of Borden County, after the Commissioners Court had levied a tax, and prior to June 1, proceeded to assess all taxable property in said county for the year 1891, and to this end gave timely notice to the duly authorized agent of appellant, a nonresident of said county, to render these lands for taxation, which he refused to do. Thereupon the assessor placed these lands updn the unrendered tax roll, valuing them at $2 per acre, which valuation was approved by the board of equalization. It appears that the acts of the different officers of Borden County in levying, assessing, and proceeding to collect these taxes were in all respects regular. In January, 1891, the aforesaid agent of appellant handed to the Comptroller a list of said lands, without valuation and not under oath, with the statement that said list contained all of appellant’s lands situated in Borden, Dawson, and Garza counties. The State Board of Equalization valued all lands in unorganized counties at 81.50 per acre. On the 30th day of December thereafter, said agent offered, for the first time, to pay to the Comptroller the taxes claimed to be due on these lands, as per the rendition made to him as aforesaid; but the Comptroller declined to issue receipts for taxes on lands situated in Borden County, stating as his reason therefor that it was an organized county, and returned to said agent the money so refused. Appellant offered to pay appellee as tax collector of Borden County the amount of taxes appearing to be due on said lands for said year, as the same was extended by the Comptroller upon the basis of paying taxes upon lands in unorganized counties by nonresidents, and refused to pay the amount as shown by the assessment rolls of Borden County. Error is assigned upon the conclusion of law, upon which the judgnient appealed from seems to be founded, that appellant had not made a valid rendition of its lands to the Comptroller prior to the organization of Borden County. We are not prepared to hold that the failure on the part of appellant to place the value upon its property or to swear to the list rendered the assessment invalid, provided the Comptroller accepted the rendition without objection on these grounds. Rev. Stats., art. 4706. We are, however, of the opinion that the judgment must be sustained upon the broader ground, that upon the organization of Borden County and the levy and assessment of State and county taxes by the proper officers of that county within the time prescribed by law, the power of the Comptroller to proceed any further in the assessment and collection of taxes in Borden County was arrested. Const., art. 8, secs. 11, 12; Rev. Stats., arts. 4728, 4728a, secs. 1-6, 14-16; Folkerts v. Powers, 42 Mich., 285. It seems to us, that in making the rendition to the Comptroller, appellant must be held to have contemplated, that under the Constitution and laws of this State, Borden County might become an organized county and assess and collect taxes, both State and county, for the year 1891. The organization and assessment having been accomplished prior to the 1st day of June of that year, appellant was not justified in refusing, after receiving timely notice, to bear its proportion of the burden of taxation; and there is nothing in its case which appeals to the equity powers of the court. If it had paid the taxes to the Comptroller prior to the organization of the county, a different question might be presented; the mere acceptance by the Comptroller of the list tendered did not, we think, exhaust the taxing power for that year. It follows that the judgment must be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 23, 1893.","The Magnolia Cattle and Land Company v. T. D. Love, Tax Collector. No. 683. 1. Taxation—County Just Organized—Taxes Assessed and Paid, ""Where.—Where lands of a nonresident situated in an unorganized county are, in January, rendered to the Comptroller for taxation, and in March following the county is organized, and prior to June 1, through its county officers, duly assesses State and county taxes on the lands, the taxes for that year are payable to the tax collector of the county, not to the Comptroller, and in the amount shown on the collector’s rolls, instead of the amount shown by the Comptroller’s rolls on the rendition made to him. 2. Same — Comptroller’s Acceptance of Rendition not Conclusive, When.—The Comptroller’s acceptance of the rendition in such case did not exhaust the taxing power for that year, and was not conclusive against the right of the county, when subsequently organized, to levy and collect the taxes, especially as he declined to receive payment of the taxes due on the rendition so. made to him. Appeal from Borden. Tried below before Hon. William Kennedy. R. H. Looney, for appellant. 1. Taxes in this State accrue on the 1st. day of January, and subsequent changes do not affect the tax. Rev-Stats., art. 4662. 2. Borden County being unorganized on the 1st day of January, 1891,. when the taxes accrued, and appellant having rendered his lands for taxation to the Comptroller in January, 1891, before said county was organized, it was the right of plaintiff to pay taxes on his land at Austin, as. for an unorganized county; appellant being a nonresident of said unorganized county. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 4728a, secs. 2, 3. I. P. Skinner and Cowan & Fisher, for appellee. 1. The value and ownership of property as existing on the 1st day of January simply forms, basis for the exercise of the taxing power; and until assessment in some of the modes prescribed by law, it can not be said that taxes have accrued; certainly none can be collected. Rev. Stats., art. 4662; Sayles’ Civ. Stats., title 95. 2. All powers conferred upon counties attach on organization, and when a county is organized it can at once proceed to exercise any of its political powers not previously exhausted. For the year 1891 no assessment of taxes for Borden County had been made prior to its organization, no legal rendition had been made, and no taxes had been paid; hence the power to assess and collect taxes in said county for that year had in no way been exhausted by any previous authority."
"HEAD, Associate Justice. Appellee having a large number of beef cattle which he desired to ship to Chicago, made a verbal contract with appellant’s agent at Sanger, a station on its road in Denton County, to have the necessary cars and engine ready for him on the morning of November 8, 1889;'and relying upon this contract, he drove his cattle from his pasture to said station, where they arrived at about 11 a. m. Appellant had the necessary cars in compliance with his contract, but no engine at said station to handle the same, and appellee was compelled to put his cattle in the pens of appellant, which were very muddy, where they remained until about 2 or 3 o’clock of the morning of the 9tli. For the damages thus received appellee instituted this suit and recovered judgment for the sum of $1040. On the trial of the case in the court below, appellee was permitted to ask several of his witnesses, “ How much, in their opinion, the cattle were damaged per head by reason of the fact that they remained in the muddy pens of the company thirteen hours on a cold, damp day and night, and did without food or something to eat from early Friday morning until about 9 or 10 o’clock Saturday night?” to which the defendant objected, for the reason that the opinion of the witness as called for respecting the damage per head was improper and misleading, and the testimony of the witnesses should have been confined to facts, leaving the jury to determine the amount of damage per head. The witnesses, in answer to this question, stated from the best of their knowledge it would be from $3 to $4 per head. We think the action of the court in admitting this evidence was error, for which the judgment.will have to be reversed. In this case these witnesses should have been allowed to state- the effect the treatment mentioned in the question would have had upon the cattle, in reducing their weight and in affecting their saleable value in the several items alleged in the plaintiff’s petition, leaving the jury to estimate the amount-of damage resulting from these causes. From the general answer of these witnesses, giving the gross amount of damage per head, we are unable to state that in arriving at this amount they confined themselves to the legitimate items of damage to be taken into consideration in making the estimate. As to what is the effect of a given kind of treatment upon an animal, either in reducing or increasing its weight, or in injuring or benefiting its appearance, is a proper matter of opinion to be stated by a witness to the jury; but as to whether these several items constitute the legal damage in a given case, and the amount of such damage, the jury must decide under proper instructions from the court. Railway v. Great-house, 82 Texas, 109; Kauffman & Runge v. Babcock, 67 Texas, 241; Clardy v. Callicoate, 24 Texas, 170. We think the court did not err in refusing to charge the jury that it would devolve upon plaintiff to prove authority on the part of defendant’s station master to make the alleged verbal contract to furnish the engine and cars. This question has recently been fully considered by our Supreme Court. Easton v. Dudley, 78 Texas, 236; McCarty v. Railway, 79 Texas, 33; Railway v. McCarty, 82 Texas, 608. We find no error in the charge of the court as set forth in appellant’s fourth assignment of which it has just cause of complaint. We do not find it to be a charge’ upon the weight of the evidence, or objectionable in failing to use the term “ market value;” but, on the contrary, we regard it as a very clear exposition of the law of the case, in so far as it did not admit of any recovery against appellant not authorized by the law. Upon the trial of the case in the court below it was shown that after the cattle were loaded in the cars, and just as the journey was commencing, appellee signed a written contract for the shipment of said cattle, in which the following clauses appear: “ 2. The shipper agrees to waive and release, and does hereby release, the company from any and all liability for or on account of any delay in shipping said stock after the delivery thereof to its agent, and from any delay in receiving the same after tender or delivery, and for breach of any alleged contract to furnish cars at any particular time; and the shipper hereby releases and does waive and bar any and all cause of action for any damage whatsoever that has occurred to the shipper by any written or verbal contract prior to the execution hereof, concerning said stock or any of them.” “9. That for the consideration aforesaid said shipper further agrees, that as a condition precedent to his right to recover any damages for any loss or injury to his said stock during the transportation thereof, or at any place or places where the same may be loaded or unloaded on the company’s road, or previous to loading thereof for shipment, he, they, or his or their agents in charge of the stock will give notice in writing of his claim therefor, specifying the nature of the claim to its station master, at said last named station on the company’s road, before said stock is removed from said station, and before the same shall have been removed, slaughtered, or intermingled with other stock, and will not move said stock from said station until the expiration of three hours after the giving of such notice, to the end that such claim may be fully and fairly investigated; and that a failure to fully comply with the terms of this clause shall be a complete bar to any recovery of any and all such damages. The written notice herein provided for can not and shall not be waived by any person except such station master, and by him only in writing.” Appellant requested the court to instruct the jury that by this contract appellee had waived and released all claim for damages accruing to the cattle before the execution of the same, and in its sixth assignment complains at the refusal of the court to give this instruction. In the case of Railway v. McCarty, 82 Texas, 608, because there was no evidence of any consideration for such waiver introduced upon the trial, it was held that the court did not err in disregarding this clause in the written contract in question in that case. We are unable to say from the report of that case whether there was any proper plea of a want of consideration for such written contract or not, but suppose such plea was filed, as no question was raised thereon. In this case appellee filed no 2)1 ea of want of consideration, and in such state of the pleading we are of opinion that the written contract made the basis of appellant’s answer imported a sufficient consideration, which could Only be called in question by a proper plea, supported by affidavit. Delivered November 29, 1892. Article 4488 of the Revised Statutes provides that “ every contract in writing hereafter made shall be held to import a consideration, in the same manner and as fully as sealed instruments have heretofore done,” and by subdivision 10 of article 1265 of the Revised Statutes it is required that an answer setting up that a written instrument upon which a ¡heading is founded is without consideration, or that the consideration of the same has failed in whole or in p>art, shall be verified by affidavit; and we see no reason why these provisions of our statute should not be held to apply to the contract ¡headed in this case. Appellant also requested the court to charge the jury, that if they believed from the evidence that, in the exercise of ordinary diligence, the agent of the plaintiff could have served the written notice or claim of damage on defendant’s station master at Purcell, and failed to do so, to . find for the defendant, and in its seventh assignment complains of the refusal of the court to give such charge. Appellant in its brief has not called our attention to the particular clause in this contract which it claims required the giving of notice to its agent at Purcell. It might be, however, that the expression that notice should be given “ to its station master at said last named station” refers to Purcell as such station. If this be'a correct interpretation of the contract, we are of opinion that the court, in view of the allegation in appellant's answer that its agent at Purcell was known to ap>p>ellee, and was easily accessible, should have given this charge. The jury, however, in passing upon the reasonableness of such requirement, would be authorized to take into consideration the length of time the cattle were stopped at Purcell, and the facilities afforded appellee for giving this notice, and all of the attendant circumstances. If appellant relied upon this clause in its contract as being reasonable, it would be its duty to afford reasonable time, opportunity, and other facilities for compflying therewith; and as to whether this was done in the particular instance would be a question for the jury to decide. Railway v. Childress & Co., ante, 302, and authorities therein cited. For the errors above indicated the judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded.","The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. W. C. Wright. No. 50. 1. Evidence — Opinion of Witness as to Damage. — 41 How much, in your opinion, were these beef cattle damaged per head by reason of the fact that they remained in the muddy pens of the railway company thirteen hours, on a cold, damp day and night, without food from early Friday morning until about 9 o’clock Saturday night?” held, to be an improper question, as calling for the opinion of the witness. 2. Same — Jury to Estimate the Damage. — As to what is the effect of a given kind of treatment upon an animal, either in reducing or increasing its weight, or in injuring or benefiting its appearance, is a proper matter of opinion to be stated by witness to the jury; but as to whether these several items constitute the legal damage in a given case, and the amount of such damage, the jury must decide under proper instructions from the court. 3. Railway Company — Authority of Station Master. — Where a station master of a railway company verbally agrees with a shipper to furnish an engine and cars at a given time, it is not necessary for the shipper, in a suit against the company for damages resulting from a failure to so furnish the cars, to allege and prove that such station master has authority to make such verbal agreement. 4. Pleading — Failure of Consideration — Cattle Shipping Contract. — Where plaintiff sues a railway company for damages occurring in the shipment of live stock, and desires to avoid a stipulation in the written contract of shipment releasing all damages that may have occurred from delay in receiving the stock, furnishing cars promptly, etc., on the ground that such release is without consideration, he should plead such want of consideration under affidavit, as required by article 1265 of the Revised Statutes. 5. Same — Written Notice of Claim of Damage — When Reasonably Required. — Where such shipping contract contains a stipulation that the shipper will give written notice of his claim of damages to the station agent at point of delivery before the stock are removed, etc., and the railway company pleads such stipulation, alleging that its station agent there was known to the plaintiff (shipper), and was easily accessible, it then becomes a question to be submitted to the jury, and to be decided by them under all the facts of the case, as to whether such requirement of written notice was reasonable or not. Appeal from Denton. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Alexander & Clark and J. W. Terry, for appellant. 1. The determination of the amount of damage per head was a mixed question of law and fact, and was for the jury to decide under appropriate instructions from the court. Railway v. Burke, 55 Texas, 323; Railway v. De Milley, 60 Texas, 194; 2 Sedg. on Meas. Dam., 633. 2.

The court erred in refusing defendant’s special charge No. 2, viz., “If you believe from the evidence that in the exercise of ordinary diligence the agent of the plaintiff could have served the written notice or claim of damage on defendant’s station master at Purcell, and that he failed to do so, you will find for defendant;” because said provision in the written contract made the submission of such a charge proper under the evidence in the case, and the stipulation was valid if reasonable. Good v. Railway, 11 S. W. Rep., 854. 4. It is competent for a party qualified so to do, to execute a release of a cause of action for a valuable consideration, and such a release is binding upon a party unless it is shown to be the result of fraud or mistake. Jagoe & Ponder, for appellee. 1. It is competent for a witness, where it is impossible to give to the jury or court a fair or intelligible understanding of the matter in controversy, to give his opinion. In such instances it is received in furtherance of justice. 60 Texas, 194; 7 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 492, 496; 2 Ct. App. C. C., 365; 69 Texas, 622. 2. An agent of a railway company has authority to bind it by special contracts relating to the business of the company. 63 Texas, 381. 3. There was no valuable consideration for the release clause in the written contract, and the same is therefore not valid, because its effect is an unreasonable limitation of the common law liability of the defendant."
"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. The judgment in this cause was affirmed by the Court of Appeals at its last term at this place, and on motion of appellant a new hearing was granted, and the cause comes to this court for disposition. There are two questions presented, viz.: First. Is the amount sued for and recovered below due as current wages for personal services ? Second. If it is, can it be offset by a debt due to appellant from appellee, which is in no way connected with it ? The facts are, that appellant employed appellee to nurse him during an attack of sickness, promising to pay him well for his services. There was no agreement fixing the compensation to be paid, either for the entire service, or by'the hour, day, week, or month. Appellant, before the present suit was brought, biit after the controversy arose, procured an assignment from one Mrs. Harrison of a debt which appellee owed her for board, and pleaded it as a setoff when sued by appellee. The court below held that the sum due appellee was for current wages for personal services, and „could not be offset as attempted. The meaning of the language “current wages for personal services,” was considered by the Court of Appeals in First National Bank v. Graham, and the terms were defined as follows: “ Current means running, now passing or present in its progress. Wages means a compensation given to a hired person for his services. Current wages are such compensation for personal services as are to be paid periodically, or from time to time, as the services are rendered; as when the services are to be paid for by the hour, day, week, month, or year. The services rendered must be such as that the compensation therefor is measured by the time of the continuance of the service.” It was held that the fee of an attorney is not exempt from garnishment 61 where he has not been hired for his services by the day, week, month, or year, to be paid at the expiration of the time for which he was hired, and not in proportion to the business done.” In case of Lydnor v. The City of Galveston, 15 Southwestern Reporter, 202, the same court held, that the fees of a physician, where he was employed and his compensation fixed per diem, were exempt. See also Bell v. Live Stock Company, 11 Southwestern Reporter, 344, in which the meaning of “ current wages” is discussed, but not authoritatively decided. The difference between the first case and this seems to be, that in the former an attorney was employed at a compensation fixed for given services, without regard to time; while here no compensation was agreed on, but the amount appellee should receive necessarily depended upon the length of time he served. The mere circumstance that the rate of compensation is not agreed on in advance ought not, in our opinion, to take the case out of the exemption. In nursing, appellee was actually occupied by the day, and his-right to compensation accrued as he served, being measured by customary or reasonable rates rather than by express contract. The remuneration to which he thereby became entitled was certainly ‘1 compensation to-a hired person for services;” and it was current, because it was accruing during the continuance of his service, and because its amount was measured by the time of his employment. The contract, it is true, did not fix the rate for stated periods of time, nor can we see anything in the language of the law to make the exemption depend on that circumstance. The accrual of his right to payment for his services was concurrent with the time during which he rendered them. The language used in the opinions referred to must be restricted to the facts of the cases then before the court. We therefore hold that the sum due appellee was correctly held to be current wages for personal services. The question remains wjiether or not the demand for current wages could be offset by an ordinary debt. We will limit our decision to the facts of this case. The statute provides, that “ the following property shall be exempt from attachment or execution, or every other species of forced sale for the payment of debts,” and in the enumeration of subjects exempted includes “ all current wages for personal services.” This language is used with reference to property which is usually subjected to payment of debts by the writs named. The terms employed would be wholly inapplicable if used with reference to debts due for wages alone, for they are not reached by being levied upon. They had already been exempted from garnishment by the Constitution and by the statute. Rev. Stats., art. 218; Const., art. 16, sec. 28. The mention of them in the provision above quoted was intended, in our judgment, to express the legislative intent that they should not be subjected to debt in any way except by the consent of the debtor; in other words, that they should be exempted from an enforced application to the discharge of debts. We need not consider what discounts arising out of the transactions between the master and servant, pending the employment of the latter, the former may deduct from the wages in settlement. No such questions arise here. The setoff pleaded accrued to another person, and had no connection with the contract of service, so far as the answer alleges. Had Mrs. Harrison garnished appellant, she could not have reached by that process the debt which he owed appellee, and, in our opinion, she can not accomplish the same result indirectly by assigning the claim and having it pleaded as a setoff. This question is decided m Colier v. Murphy, 16 Southwestern Reporter, 465 (Tennessee). See, also, William Deering Co. v. Ruffner, 49 Northwestern Reporter, 771. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 9, 1893.","Daniel Dempsey v. R. K. McKennell. No. 208. 1. Current Wages.—Appellant employed appellee to nurse him through a spell of sickness, and promised to pay him well for his services, but there was no agreement fixing the compensation to be paid, either for the entire service, or by the hour, day, week, or month. The mere circumstance that the rate of compensation is not agreed on in advance, ought not to take the case out of the exemption. In nursing, appellee was actually occupied by the day, and his right to compensation accrued as he served, being measured by customary or reasonable rates, and was certainly “ compensation to a hired person for services,” and current because accruing during the continuance of service, and the amount measured by the time of his employment. 2. Offset Against Current Wages. — Appellant, before suit but after-controversy had arisen, procured an assignment from one Mrs. Harrison of a debt appellee owed her for board, and pleaded it as setoff when sued by appellee. The setoff pleaded accrued to another person, and had no connection with the contract of service. Had Mrs. Harrison garnished appellant, she could not have reached by that process the debt he owed appellee, and she can not accomplish the same result virtually by assigning the claim and having it pleaded as a setoff. Appeal from Jackson. Tried below before Hon. Hugh L. White, County Judge. A. B. Peticolas, for appellant. 1. The court erred in holding the claim sued on by plaintiff to be current wages. In Bank v. Graham, 3 Willson’s Civil Cases, the court uses this language: “Current wages arc-such compensation for personal services as are to be paid periodically from time to time as the services are rendered, as where the services are to be paid for by the hour, the day, the month, or the year. The services must be such as that the compensation therefor is measured by the time of the continuance of such service.” 3 Willson’s C. C., 462; Jenks v. Dyer, 115 Mass., 235; Branard v. Shannon, 60 Mo., 342; Somers v. Kelcher, 115 Mass., 165. 2. A just counter-claim is good against current wages or any character of debt which may be sued on by a plaintiff. Rev. Stats., art. 645; Eason v. Locherer, 42 Texas, 173; Townsend v. Quinan, 47 Texas, 6; Bennett v.Carsner, 1 W.&W. C. C., 619; Bolton v. Sadler, 1W. & W. C. C., 1226. W. A. McDowell, for appellee. An outstanding claim, purchased after services have been rendered, can not be used as an offset against “ current wages for personal services” due by the purchaser of such claim to the performer of such “services,” as between the purchaser and the wage worker upon demand for such wages.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This is an appeal prosecuted by M. S. Swearingen from a judgment rendered by the District Court of Childress County in behalf of Fannie A. Reed, the wife of James A. Reed. This lady, joined by her husband, brought this suit, in the nature of an action of trespass to try title, to recover from appellant, M. S. Swearingen, in her separate interest, 10 acres of land out of the south half of section 576, block H, in Childress County, Texas. This section was located by virtue of certificate number g-fg, granted to the Waco & Northwestern Railway Company. In 1886 the State Land Board, under the Act of 1883, and upon the application of J. A. Reed, sold and awarded to him the south half of the section described, which was school land. January 13, 1888, James A. Reed, for the recited consideration of §450, executed a deed with clause of general warranty to his wife, Fannie A. Reed. This deed contains no recital that the conveyance is intended for the separate use and benefit of the wife. It purports to be executed in Childress County, Texas. The land conveyed is described therein as “the south half of section number 576, block H, Waco & Northwestern Railway Company survey, certificate number gJ-g.” The State or county in which the land is situated is not recited. The deed, properly acknowledged, was recorded in Childress County, January 13, 1888. It is alleged in the petition, that the proper number of the certificate referred to in the deed is g|g, and that the number recited in the deed as gj-g was inserted by mistake. James A. Reed, the grantor, testified that the deed should have recited the certificate number as gf-g, instead of g-J-g; that the former is the true certificate number of section 576. On this conveyance rests the claim of the appellee Fannie A. Reed. August 6, 1890, James A. Reed filed an instrument designating 200 acres of the south half of section 576 as the homestead of himself and family. On the same day he executed to J. W. Swearingen a deed conveying 10 acres out of the south half of the survey named, the 10 acres, however, not being included in the homestead designation. August 11, 1890, J. W. Swearingen conveyed the 10 acres named to M. S. Swearingen, the appellant herein. The appellant and the appellee Fannie A. Reed claim under James A. Reed as a common source of title. The two assignments of error inserted in appellant’s brief contain, in effect, the same complaint, viz., that the court erred in concluding as a matter of law that by the deed from James A. Reed to his wife, Fannie A. Reed, the former was divested of all title to the entire south half (including the 10 acres in controversy) of section 576, block H, Waco & Northwestern Railway Company stirvey, located by virtue of certificate T|g-, in Childress County. 1. As the appellant deraigns his title from James A. Reed as the common source, we find no merit in his several propositions asserting the existence of an outstanding title in the State, because of the fact alleged by Mm (though not found by us to exist), that Reed failed to comply with the statute of 1883 providing for the sale of school land. The appellant will not be permitted to impugn the title of Reed, under which he claims, but is held to admit its validity. Glover v. Thomas, 75 Texas, 506. 2. The deed from James A. Reed to his wife indicates on its face, we think, an intention by him to vest in her as her separate property the land therein described. In a transaction between husband and wife it is not necessary that the deed, in order to have the effect referred to, should contain a recital that the conveyance is intended for the separate use of' the wife. Lewis v. Simon, 72 Texas, 475; Callahan v. Houston, 78 Texas, 494. Only creditors or subsequent purchasers without notice can question the validity of such a deed. De Garca v. Galvan, 55 Texas, 53;. Brown v. Brown, 71 Texas, 355. James A. Reed testified, “ that he executed the deed in question to his wife for the purpose of inducing her to come to Texas and live with him; that he did not intend by the execution of the deed that the property therein described should become the separate property of his wife; that he had intended that himself and his wife should own it equally, living on it and using it together; that he did not communicate to his ^ife that such were his intentions in making the deed.” The court, in a finding of fact, holds this evidence to be inadmissible and declines to consider it in arriving at his conclusions. Under a proposition in appellant’s brief, to the effect that the evidence shows that it was not the intention of James A. Reed to vest the title in his wife to the property in question, it is sought, in an argumentative way, to complain of this finding of the court. It was the duty of appellant, if he desired to invoke a review by us of this action of the court, to complain of it by specific assignment of error. As he has failed so to suggest the question, we decline to consider it. We think that had the court weighed the testimony and. notwithstanding, found that it was the intention of James A. Eeed to convey the property to the separate benefit of his wife, there would be sufficient evidence gathered from the terms of the deed itself to sustain this finding. We express no opinion, however, on the admissibility of the statement of the husband. 3. It appears that at the date of the execution of this instrument James A. Eeed had made to the State only one payment of the purchase money of the land, the remaining indebtedness not having matured. On this fact appellant founds the contention, that the contract between Eeed and his wife (having necessary reference to future payments for the land to be made out of the community funds) was void. We are unable to sustain this proposition. As appellant does not pretend to have occupied the attitude of a creditor of James A. Eeed, he can not complain of the transaction by which the husband secured to the separate use of his wife future acquisitions which would, in the absence of such a contract, be community property. Thus, though interest accruing upon the separate money of the wife is of the community, the husband, nevertheless, can so contract with the wife that such interest, except as to the existing creditors, shall be the separate property of the wife. Hall v. Hall, 52 Texas, 294; Martin Brown Co. v. Perrill, 77 Texas, 204. 4. We are of opinion that the court was justified in concluding that the appellant and his vendor should be held to be affected at the time of their purchase with notice of the conveyance by James A. Eeed to his wife. The description of the land, though defective and incorrect as to the certificate number, as already pointed out, was, inasmuch as it indicated the correct section and name of the survey, and inasmuch as the deed was duly recorded, sufficient to put a prudent man upon inquiry with reference to the scope and character of the instrument and of the property thereby conveyed. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 16, 1893 A motion for rehearing was overruled.","M. S. Swearingen v. F. A. Reed and J. A. Reed. No. 89. 1. Trespass to Try Title—Common Source as Estoppel.—Where, in trespass to try title, hath parties deraign title through a common source, the defendant is held to admit the validity of the title, and can not impugn it by the assertion of outstanding title back of the common source. 2. Deed of Husband to Wife — Recitals — Separate Property.— Where the husband conveys land to the wife, it is not necessary, in order to vest, the title in her as her separate property, that the deed should contain a recital that the conveyance is intended for her separate use. 3.

Reed to said school land, the title thereto was held by the State of Texas, and the right a,nd title to said land was to be earned only by onerous conditions, such as the payment of the purchase money, residing upon, occupying, and improving the land for the term of three years. Such conditions and requirements rendered void any contract between husband and wife that-the after-acquired title to said property should enure to the sole and separate use and benefit and should become the separate property of the wife.

Reed is insufficient to put any one on notice of the claim of F. A. Reed to the south half of section 576, block H, because the deed describes said land as “ the south half of section number 576, block H, Waco & Northwestern Railway Company survey, certificate number g-J-g,” not stating in what State or county the said land was situated, and giving to the certificate number a false designation; and the court erred in admitting the deed in evidence over defendant’s objection.

The deed of the husband conveying community property to the wife implies the husband’s intention to change the character of the property from community to separate property of the wife.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On the 1st day of August, 1873, judgment was rendered in the District Court for Harris County, Texas, in favor of W. C. O. Driscoll against S. S. Munger for §931.16 in gold, and bearing interest at the rate of 30 per cent per annum from rendition, a copy of which was properly recorded in Montague County on January 12,1874. On the 2d day of June, 1874, an execution was issued on said judgment, directed to the sheriff or any constable of Harris County, and was returned unsatisfied, the return stating that no property of defendant was. found in said county subject to execution. On the 1st day of August, 1874, S. S. Munger conveyed the land in controversy to W. C. McGowan by general warranty deed, which was recorded in Montague County, August 24, 1874. On the first Tuesday in March, 1875, the land in controversy was sold under an execution issued upon the judgment aforesaid, and at said sale defendant W. A. Morris bid it in for the sum of §26.50, and sometime thereafter had a deed made to himself, but at the time of said bid he was the agent of Driscoll, the plaintiff in the execution, and was bidding for him. This suit was instituted in 1875 by Driscoll against Morris to have the deed to the latter declared a trust in favor of the former. In this suit McGowan intervened. Since the filing of his plea of intervention, McGowan has died, leaving the appellees B. A. McGowan, Floyd McGowan, Mary Slaughter, and Josephine Runech as his heirs. W. C. O. Driscoll has also died, leaving appellant McKinnon and one Margaret Drew as his. only heirs. The last named having released all her interest to McGowan, the plea of intervention by McKinnon at the trial below was prosecuted to recover only a one-lialf interest in the land. The land at the time of the execution sale aforesaid was worth from $1.50 to $2 per acre, and the price at which it was bid in by Morris was a grossly inadequate consideration therefor. The verdict of the jury under the charge of the court establishes, that at the time of the issuance of the first execution upon the judgment in favor of Driscoll to Harris County, the defendant Munger had personal property in that county subject to execution sufficient to satisfy the same, but the sheriff did not call upon him for a levy, and he had no opportunity to point out said property. The execution upon which the land was sold did not show upon its face that any previous execution had been issued upon the judgment, and it appeared to have been issued more than one year after the rendition thereof. There was no direct evidence that the irregularities above referred to conduced to the inadequacy of the consideration at which the land was sold. Upon the verdict of the jury judgment was rendered in the court below cancelling the sheriff’s sale of the land, and in favor of the heirs of McGowan for the recovery thereof, from which plaintiff McKinnon appeals. The other defendants claim under Morris, and none of them occupy the position of innocent purchasers, and they have not appealed from the judgment rendered against them. The case has already twice been before our Supreme Court. 53 Texas, 213; 11 S. W. Kep., 532. The court below gave the following charge to the jury: “ If you find from the evidence that said S. S. Munger resided in Harris County, where the judgment in favor of Driscoll against him was rendered, and owned personal property situated in said county subject to execution at the time of the suing out of said execution sufficient to satisfy said judgment, but that said Driscoll, without pointing out said personal property or causing the sheriff to require said Munger to point out said property, sued out the execution to Montague County without the knowledge of said Munger, and caused the land in controversy to be sold under said execution without the knowledge of said Munger, these facts, if you find they are true, would constitute an irregularity.” Appellant in his first assignment complains of this charge, “ because there was no testimony to warrant same, and because the same is not the law, and was calculated to mislead and confuse the jury; and because, if an irregularity, could not have injured the rights of appellees nor in any way have affected the sale of the land to the prejudice of the judgment debtor, and is a charge upon the weight of the evidence.” The other members of the court are of opinion that none of these objections to the charge are well taken, and we are all of opinion that the charge is not subject to either of the objections made to it in the propositions presented by appellant under this assignment. The first proposition by appellant under this assignment is as follows: “ Mere irregularities in making a judicial sale, when taken in connection with gross inadequacy of consideration, will not alone be held a sufficient ground to vacate such sale, unless the facts show that the identical irregularities conduced to such inadequacy of price.” A subsequent paragraph of the charge completely meets this proposition. This paragraph of the charge is as follows: “ If you find from the evidence that the land in controversy, at the sale thereof on the 2d day of March, 1875, when the same was struck off to W. A. Morris as the agent of W. C. 0. Driscoll, sold for a grossly inadequate price, and that the irregularities above mentioned conduced to such inadequacy of price, then you will find for the intervenor; but if you find from the evidence that said land did not sell for a grossly inadequate price, or if it did sell for a grossly inadequate price, yet if the irregularities herein before mentioned did not conduce thereto, then you can not find for the intervenor; and the burthen of proof is on the intervenor to show that said land sold for a grossly inadequate price, and that the irregularities above mentioned, or some of them, conduced thereto.” We are of opinion that this charge presented the law upon the question involved in the proposition as favorably to appellant as the previous decisions of our Supreme Court would justify. Allen v. Pierson, 60 Texas, 604; McKinnon v. McGowan, 11 S. W. Rep., 532; Irvin v. Ferguson, 83 Texas, 491. The second proposition submitted under this assignment was as follows: “ The trial court should never go out of the record and hatch up theories and charge on general propositions of law when the facts of the case at bar do not support it.” It will be observed that the charge complained of only instructed the jury that certain facts therein detailed, if found to exist, would constitute an irregularity. Munger, the defendant in the execution, testified that he had personal property in Harris County sufficient to satisfy the judgment, and that no one called upon him for a levy, and he had no opportunity to point out the same. There is evidence in the record which tends to contradict his statement that he had such property, but none beyond the return of the officer that he was called upon for a levy; and we agree, that if the facts as detailed in the charge constitute an irregularity in law, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury finding that they in fact did exist, and that this proposition therefore is not well taken. Appellant in his second assignment of error complains at the action of the court in charging the jury, that the failure of the execution under which the land was sold to show on its face that the judgment had been kept alive by the issuance of previous executions was an irregularity; the ground of objection being, as alleged by appellant, that the execution did show that two previous executions had been issued, and because, if an irregularity, it could not have injured the rights of either Hunger or appellees, and was a charge upon the weight of the evidence. It is recited in the statement of facts, that the execution was in the usual form, except that on its face it made no mention of any previous execution having been issued on said judgment, and did not mention any rate of interest; but the bill of costs attached to the execution contained one item, as follows: “Alias execution, .75; pluries, .75; total, Si.50.” And the execution was endorsed as follows: “ W. C. O. Driscoll v. S. S. Munger. Al. execution. Issued January 11, 1875.” We are of opinion that the court did not err in holding that these recitals did not comply with paragraph 7 of article 2281 of the Revised Statutes, which says, “ When an alias or pluries execution is issued, it shall show upon its face the number of previous executions which have been issued on the judgment;” and we are also of opinion that the charge was not upon the weight of the evidence. It was proper for the court to tell the jury that this failure to comply with the plain requirements of the statute was an irregularity. Appellant’s fourth and sixth assignments complain at the failure of the court in its charge to instruct the jury, that the fact that Driscoll’s judgment lien was prior to the sale to McGowan would prevent those claiming under McGowan from setting aside the sale on account of the irregularities and gross inadequacy of the consideration above referred to; but we are of opinion that this is not the law of the case. We do not understand that the fact that appellant’s lien may have been prior in time would prevent those owning the land from objecting to irregularities in its sale. They were still interested in its bringing its full value, notwithstanding such prior lien. If, however, they succeeded in setting aside the sale, this would not cancel such lien if it existed, and appellant, unless precluded upon other grounds, could still enforce the same. The land would still remain subject to the judgment. Appellant does not contend that in such case it would be necessary for the owner of the land to tender the full amount of the judgment in order to vacate the sale, nor are we prepared to hold this to be the law had he so contended. Upon the trial in the court below intervenors offered in evidence as a recorded instrument the deed from Hunger to McGowan, the certificate of acknowledgment to which did not recite that the grantor was known to the officer, to which appellant objected. This acknowledgment was taken in 1874, and it has been decided that the law in force at that time did not require the officer to certify that the grantor was known to him, but only required him, in case the grantor was not known, to attach certain proof of his identity. These proofs not being attached to the certificate of acknowledgment, we think it should be presumed that the grantor was known to the officer, and the acknowledgment therefore be held sufficient. Watkins v. Hall, 57 Texas, 4. Appellant’s only remaining assignment of error isas follows: “Because the court erred in not giving the plaintiff a new trial.” Plaintiff’s motion for a new trial embraced a number of distinct grounds, and appellees object to our considering it because it is too general, and we think this objection must be sustained under repeated decisions of our Supreme Court. The sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict and judgment is therefore not presented for our consideration; but we do not wish to be understood as intimating that even if it had been so presented we would hold it insufficient. As to this, we do not decide. We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 9, 1893.","W. C. O. Driscoll et al. v. W. A. Morris et al. No. 112. 1. Execution Sale —Alias Execution Irregularly Issued, When. The issuance of an alias execution to another county, to be levied on land there, while the judgment debtor owns personal property in the county where the judgment was rendered, which has not been levied on, and which he has not been called on to point out, constitutes an irregularity. 2. Same—Alias Execution Should Recite Previous Executions. An endorsement of “ al. execution” on the back of a writ of execution, and a mention in the bill of costs attached to such writ of the items of costs for the issuance of previous executions, is not a compliance with the requirement of the statute, that11 when an alias or pluries execution is issued, it shall show upon its face the number of previous executions which have been issued on the judgment.” 3. Same—Irregularities Affect Validity of Sale, When.—The court did not err in charging that if the jury found that at the sale under the alias execution the land was struck off to the execution plaintiff at a grossly inadequate price, and that the irregularities above mentioned conduced to such inadequacy of price, they should find in favor of the party seeking to have such sale cancelled and annulled; but if the irregularities did not conduce to such inadequacy, they' should not find in favor of such party. 4. Same—Judgment Lien—Right of one Purchasing Subject to. That a purchaser of land bought it subject to a prior judgment lien thereon, does not preclude him from the right to attack a sale made under the judgment, on the ground of irregularities in such sale, and gross inadequacy of price realized thereat. 5. Acknowledgment of Deed—Certifying Identity of Grantor.— The law in force in 1874 did not require that the officer taking the acknowledgment of a deed should certify that the grantor was known to him. Following Watkins v. Hall, 57 Texas, 4. 6. Practice on Appeal — Assignment of Error. — Where plaintiff’s motion for new trial in the lower court embraced a number of distinct grounds, an assignment of error specifying only that “ the court erred in not giving plaintiff a new trial,” is too general, and will not be considered. Appeal from Montague. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Sparks & Smith, for appellant J. D. McKinnon.

The charge of the court complained of by appellant correctly submitted to the jury the law governing the question at issue, viz., did the irregularities prior to the sale cause or tend to cause the inadequacy of the price which the land brought at the sale ?

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This case went off on demurrer. Appellant, a corporation chartered in Illinois, sued the trustees of a school district in Clay County on a promissory note executed by their predecessors, under the school law of 1884, for school furniture for said district; alleging that the furniture was necessary, and that the school community continued to use it, etc., and praying in the alternative to recover on a quantum meruit. We are of opinion that the law did not authorize the trustees to bind the school district in the manner alleged, and that appellant’s only remedy was to recover the furniture. We are confirmed in these views by the case cited by appellant from the Supreme Court of the State of its domicile, which decides both propositions squarely against it. Clark v. School District, 78 Ill., 474. The judgment will be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 30, 1893. A motion for rehearing was overruled.","A. H. Andrews & Co. v. John Curtis et al., Trustees. No. 748.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. Appellant prosecutes this appeal from a judgment rendered against it, and in favor of appellees, on account of personal injuries resulting in the death of D. H. Bledsoe, husband and father of the appellees, respectively. It is apparent from the pleadings and from the record, that the injuries were received while the property of the defendant company was in the hands of John C. Brown and Lionel A. Sheldon, as receivers. Under such circumstances a recovery, it is well settled, can not be adjudged against the receivers. Turner v. Cross and Eddy, 83 Texas, 218; Receivers v. Selph, 83 Texas, 607. Nor could a recovery be adjudged against the company for the negligence of the receivers. Railway v. Collins, 84 Texas, 121. Appellees seek to maintain the judgment in this case on two grounds, which, as they contend, were not considered by the court in the case of Turner v. Eddy and Cross, above cited. These grounds are as follows: First. Appellant is liable under subdivision 2 of article 2899, Revised. Statutes, which subdivision reads as follows: “2. When the death of any person is caused by the wrongful act, negligence, unskillfulness, or default of another.” Second. Appellant is liable under subdivision 1 of article 2899, not indeed as9the ‘1 proprietor, owner, charterer, or hirer ” of a railroad (the sole relation considered in the Turner case), but because the receivers must be regarded as the “servants or agents” of the appellant at the-time the injury was inflicted. We are unable to sustain either of these propositions. Subdivision 2 is applicable only when the act or omission complained of is chargeable to the direct or immediate agency or negligence of the person sought to be bound. Hendrick v. Walton, 69 Texas, 192. We do not understand it to be here contended that the receivers were personally and immediately guilty of the negligence complained of. With reference to the first subdivision: Receivers (in the absence, at least, of facts specially affecting and qualifying their relation) are to be regarded not as the agents of the railway company itself, but as the representatives of the court appointing them, for the preservation and management of the property. Brown v. Warner, 78 Texas, 543; Railway v. Geiger, 79 Texas, 13. These views remain unchanged after a careful perusal of the case of Railway v. Cox, 145 United States, 593, cited by appellees, which involves the construction of the liability of receivers under a statute of Louisiana. We decline to adopt the suggestion of appellant, to reverse and dismiss this case. We are not prepared to say that a state of facts might not exist, and be made to appear on another trial, requiring the receivers to be considered agents or representatives of the railroad corporation. In any event, we prefer the course usually followed by our Supreme Court, to reverse the judgment and to remand the cause. It is accordingly so ordered. • Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 3, 1893.","SECOND DISTRICT, JANUARY, 1893. Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. Mrs. D. H. Bledsoe et al. No. 412. 1. Beceiver of Bailway Company.—The receiver of a railway company is ordinarily to be regarded not as the agent of the company but as the representative of the court appointing him, for the preservation and management of the property; and a recovery can not be had against the company for the negligence of the receiver. 2. Same—Company not Liable, When—Statute Construed.—Under subdivision 2, article 2899, of the Revised Statutes, a railway company can not be held liable for negligence resulting in the death of a person from injuries received while the road was in the hands of a receiver, where it does not appear that the receiver was personally and immediately guilty of the negligence complained-of.

Templeton & Kern and Hunter, Stewart & Dunklin, for appellees. 1. The decision in Turner v. Cross and Eddy, 83 Texas, 218, was based' solely on the question whether or not the receiver could be considered: “the proprietor, owner, charterer, or hirer of any railway.’’ Under the-circumstances of this case, the receiver was the agent or servant of appellant, and by reason thereof appellant is liable, even under this subdivision 1 of article 2899, Revised Statutes. Ryan v. Hays, 62 Texas, 42. 2. Subdivision 2 of article 2899 gives a right of action on account of injuries occasioning death, “ when the death of any person is caused by the wrongful act, negligence, unskillfulness, or default of another;” and this was intended to cover every case of death so resulting and not provided for in the preceding subdivision of the same article.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. In December, 1883, appellant sold to appellee 160 acres of land in Parker County, for which appellee agreed to pay $1400, paying $400 cash, and executing his two notes for $500 each, secured by vendor’s lien. Appellee, not having paid said notes in full, left the place on January 1, 1888, and appellant, with the consent of appellee, took possession of the same and held such possession during the years 1888 and 1889. In 1889 appellee returned and demanded possession of the place, and instituted suit of forcible entry and detainer to recover same. On the 21st of April, 1889, appellant and appellee filed in the County Court of said county an agreement under the statute to arbitrate the matters in controversy between them, a part of which agreement is as follows: ‘ ‘ Whereas, heretofore J. K. Bowden sold a certain farm in said county to S. M. Crow, containing 160 acres, vendor’s lien notes being executed by said Crow, and that as a substitute for said notes said Crow gave, on January 1, 1887, his note for §854, bearing interest from date; and whereas, J. K. Bowden, with the consent of S. M. Crow, went into possession of said farm January 1, 1888, and now holds the same; and whereas, said Crow has sued for possession; now, therefore, we hereby agree that the matters herein after mentioned shall be submitted to arbitration, to-wit: “1. How much rent shall J. K. Bowden pay to S. M. Crow for the use of said land as rents from January 1, 1888, to date ? “ 2. How much shall S. M. Crow pay J. K. Bowden for improvements made on said land since January 1, 1888 ? “3. How much is due by S. M. Crow as principal and interest on said §854 note ? “ 4. How much interest is due to S. M. Crow on rents on said lands held by J. It. Bowden for the years 1888 and 1889 ?” It was also stipulated in the agreement for arbitration, that upon filing the report of the arbitrators with the county clerk the forcible entry and detainer case should be dismissed, and that Crow should save Bowden harmless on the §854 note, which had been deposited with the Corsicana Loan Agency as collateral security. W. R. McCreary was named as one of the arbitrators by Crow, and N. M. Dennis by Bowden. The two arbitrators thus selected, having heard the evidence and failing to agree, an umpire was named by the clerk in compliance with the statute, and the three thus selected again heard the evidence, and on July 18, 1890, filed the following award: “S. M. Crow v. J. K. Bowden.—Matter of Arbitration. July 18,1890. The undersigned N. M.

Dennis, Arbitrator. “ I think the above award is too high and illegal, and I hereby dissent therefrom. “W. R. McCreary» “ Filed July 18, 1890. “ B. W. Aicard, “ County Clerk Parker County, Texas.”' Appellee being dissatisfied with this award, on October 20, 1890, filed his amended petition, objecting to its being made the judgment of the court, charging in general terms that the arbitrators in making the same were actuated by gross partiality, fraud, and mistake, and also alleging that the items of $20 for hauling rock, and $150 and $60 for grubbing, did not come within the terms of the submission. He also contended that the first and fourth questions submitted to the arbitrators had been ignored by them. Appellant filed general and special exceptions to the plea of appellee attacking this award. The special exception objected to the general terms in which the alleged fraud, partiality, and mistake were charged, and we are of opinion that this exception should have been sustained. It is well settled in this State, that where it is sought to set aside an award by arbitrators on the grounds above set forth, the facts constituting the objection to the award must be specifically averred; and in order to prevent the award from being made the judgment of the court in compliance with the agreement, it is necessary that the facts alleged be sufficient to vacate it when impeached in a court of equity. The principles governing such cases are so well settled by repeated decisions in this State, that it would be a useless consumption of time for us to undertake to review them. Payne v. Metz, 14 Texas, 56; Forshey v. Railway, 16 Texas, 532; McHugh v. Peck, 29 Texas, 150; Alexander v. Mulhall, 1 Posey’s U. C., 764. We are also of opinion, that appellant’s assignment challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to set aside this award is well taken. We find no evidence whatever in the record to sustain the charge of fraud and partiality made against these arbitrators, and if any mistake was made by them, so far as this record discloses, it must be classed as a mistake of judgment and not of fact. The evidence introduced by the appellee in support of the charges made by him seems to relate almost entirely to the merits of the controversy between the parties, as though no award had been made,, and no attempt seems to have been made by him to show that these men had any prejudice against him or partiality for his adversary. That the first and fourth items contained in the agreement for submission were not overlooked by the arbitrators, but that full evidence was heard thereon, is made clear by all the witnesses, including the arbitrator selected by appellee; and upon such hearing a majority of the arbitrators decided that appellee was not entitled to rent for the years 1888 and 1889, but in a spirit of liberality they decided to allow him credit for $140, interest that had been paid by appellant, in lieu of such rent. Certainly the allowance of this sum, when the arbitrators were of the opinion that appellee was entitled to nothing, furnishes no ground of complaint to him, unless their action in failing to allow him rent was erroneous, and as to whether or not such rent should have been allowed was decided by them against appellee after hearing the evidence, in which there was a sharp conflict. We are also of opinion that the items of $20 for hauling rock, $150 for grubbing 15 acres of land at $10 per acre, and $60 for grubbing 30 acres of .shrubbed land, were properly considered by the arbitrators as coming within the meaning of improvements made on the land, as submitted by the second clause of the agreement. The $20 item was evidently for hauling rock to be used in building the chimneys; and while it might have been technically more correct for the arbitrators to have valued the chimneys at $50 after they were completed, instead of itemizing the cost at $20 for hauling the rock and $30 for putting it up, yet there was no substantial ground of complaint if they preferred the latter course. We also believe that the cost of putting wild land in cultivation is generally classed under the head of improvements in actions of trespass to try title, and we see no good reason why the same rule should not apply in this case. Certainly it would not be equitable to require one, under the circumstances of this case, to expend more in putting timber land in cultivation than the value of the land itself, and receive no compensation therefor. It seems that upon the trial of the case in the court below, the jury were impanelled and the evidence submitted upon the whole case, and the court first passed upon the issues as to whether or not the award of the arbitrators should be made the judgment of the court or should be set aside, and the issues upon the merits of the controversy were then submitted to the jury upon the evidence; and it must be conceded that, there is an expression in the syllabus to the case of Shulte v. Hoffman, 18, Texas, 678, which would indicate it to be the correct practice for the court to decide the issues of fact raised upon objections to receiving an award; but we are of opinion that the practice which should be adopted in such cases is that which obtains in an equitable proceeding to set aside a judgment subsequent to the term at which it was rendered. The grounds for vacating an award by arbitrators are quite similar to those for setting aside a verdict of a jury or a judgment of a court; and in this class of cases the practice is now quite well settled to be, that when complaint is made of a verdict or judgment after the conclusion of the term, the complainant must set forth the facts of his case, as well as the grounds upon which he seeks to set aside the judgment, and the whole ease is decided by the jury under proper instructions from the court. If the jury find that the judgment should be set aside, they at the same time pass upon the merits of the case; but if they find that the judgment should not be vacated, they proceed no further. Taylor, Knapp & Co. v. Fore, 42 Texas, 256; Roller v. Wooldridge, 46 Texas, 485; Overton v. Blum, 50 Texas, 417; Raymond v. Conger, 51 Texas, 536; O'Neill v. Brown, 61 Texas, 34. We think the charges of fraud and partiality on the part of the arbitrators are questions which should be passed upon by the jury under appropriate instructions from the court, as well as the questions involving the merits of the controversy. Appellant complains of the general way in which the court below submitted the issues to the jury on the merits of the case. We are of opinion that the charge of the court in such cases should be as full upon all the issues as in other cases tried before it, but if the court fails to give a proper charge the complaining party should request appropriate instructions. Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance herewith. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 2, 1893.","SECOND DISTRICT, MARCH, 1893. J. K. Bowden v. S. M. Crow. No. 739. 1. Award—Pleadings Necessary to Avoid.—Where it is sought to set aside an award hy arbitrators on the grounds of fraud, partiality, or mistake, general allegations are not sufficient, but the facts constituting the objection must be specifically averred, and they must be such as would be sufficient to vacate it when impeached in a court of equity. 2. Same—Evidence Requisite to Vacate Award.—Charges of fraud, partiality, and mistake in making an award are not sustained by evidence relating to the merits of the controversy between the parties as though no award had been made, and which fails to show fraud or partiality by the arbitrators, or any mistake of fact by them of a material character. 3. Same—Practice—Issues.—In a proceeding to set aside an award the entire controversy should be submitted to the jury, under proper instructions— the grounds for vacating the award, and also the merits of the case. If the jury find that the award should not he set aside, they proceed no further; otherwise, they pass upon the merits of the case. 4. Charge of Court — Instructions Must be Requested, When.— Complaint of the general way in which the court submitted the issues to the jury is not available on appeal where the complaining party failed to request appropriate instructions.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This suit was brought in Justice Court by appellee against appellant upon two drafts or bills of exchange drawn by appellant in favor of appellee on the Houston, East & West Texas Railway Company, payment of which had been refused by the drawee on presentation. Appellant filed in the Justice Court a written plea under oath, alleging, in substance, that the drafts were given for tie timber purchased of appellee for the Houston, East & West Texas Railway; that it was understood between appellant and appellee, at the time the drafts were given, that appellant was not to be held liable upon them, but that appellee was to look to the railway company for payment; and that the drafts were intended only as memoranda or vouchers to show the amount due appellee from the compafiy for timber. Exceptions to this plea were sustained in the Justice Court; and in the ■ District Court, to which the case was taken on appeal, the same ruling was made; this ruling forms the basis of the only complaint made in this court on appeal. The ruling of the court below sustaining exceptions to the plea, was correct. The plea plainly sought to vary the written instruments sued on, by proof of parol contemporaneous agreement. Delivered October 11, 1892. By those instruments appellant agreed that the railway company would pay the amounts specified in them, and that if the company failed to do so, appellee would.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Suit by appellant to recover damages for the alleged negligent killing of her son, Jack Goolsby, by appellee. The cause was tried by the judge, a jury having been waived, and judgment, upon conclusions of law and fact, was rendered for appellee. There is no assignment of errors in the record, and unless there is fundamental error apparent the judgment must be affirmed. The findings of fact by the court below are sustained by the evidence, and, briefly stated, are as follows: Deceased was lying asleep on appellee’srailway track, and was run over and killed by one of its trains. Appellee’s servants discovered him as soon as they could do so with reasonable care, and used all proper diligence to stop the train, but were so close to him that they could not do so until the cars had passed over his body. The conclusion of law, that appellee was not liable, resulted necessarily from these facts. Appellant sought a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. It seems that one Simmons had misled appellant’s attorney by statements, made before announcement for trial, which tended to show that the servants operating the train could have stopped it after discoving the body upon the track, and thus avoided injury to the deceased, and that they were guilty of negligence in not doing so; and that the witness on the stand testified to a different state of facts, admitting at the same time that he had made the statements imputed to him. Without going into all the facts shown in the motion and the accompanying affidavits, it will suffice to say that appellant, when she discovered during the trial that the witness had deceived her attorney, should have applied for leave to withdraw her announcement, and to continue the case. Having proceeded with the trial and taken the chances of a judgment, she-ought not to be allowed to complain. Besides, we can not see from' the showing made that appellant was justified in relying so implicitly on one witness, when the facts were disputed, and when those shown by the affidavits made in connection with the motion for new trial were of a character to have been easily proven, if true. There being no error apparent, the judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 9, 1893.","Martha Gregory v. Southern Pacific Railway Company. No. 74. 1.

Practice when Witness Misleads the Party Calling Him.—A witness for plaintiff made statements to plaintiff before the trial tending to show a different state of facts than that testified to by him.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On the 1st day of January, 1889, appellant was the owner of 22,893 acres of land situated in Stonewall County, which, through his agents, Thomson & Donnan, he rendered to the assessor for taxation at the rate of 81 per acre. This rendition was made out at Austin, and forwarded to the assessor by mail, who, upon receipt of same, notified appellant’s said agents that this valuation was too low, and would be referred by him to the board of equalization. On the 27th of June the board of equalization of Stonewall County raised the valuation of this land from $1 to $3.50 per acre. Prior to this, on the 27th of May, 1889, the Commissioners Court of said county met as a board of equalization and ordered the clerk to give, ten days notice of the sitting of the board, and the clerk, in obedience to said order, in person posted one notice at the court house door of Stonewall County, but did not post such notices in each justice’s precinct in said county. Said, clerk also mailed to Thomson & Donnan a written notice that the board of equalization desired to raise the valuation of said land so rendered by them for appellant, but he did not issue notices in the name of the State of Texas, directed to the sheriff or any constable of Travis County, Texas, or any other constable or sheriff of the State, citing Thomson & Donnan to appear before the said board to show cause why the rendition of S. M. Swenson’s property should not be raised, as it is contended is required by article 1531, 1 Sayles’ Civil Statutes. The board raised the valuation-above set forth without hearing any evidence as to the value of the land, but acted upon their own knowledge in fixing its value. On the 13th day of February, 1889, the Commissioners Court of Stonewall County, assuming to act under article 3731, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, divided said county into a convenient number of school districts, and thereafter a petition, in form in compliance with the law, was presented to the Commissioners Court of said county praying for an election to beheld in district number 1 to determine whether or not a tax of 20 cents on the $100 should be levied for school purposes. To said petition was signed thirty-two names. In compliance with this petition, said court ordered an election as prayed for therein, to be held on April 20, 1889, which is in words as follows: “ It is ordered by the court, that the application for an election on school tax in district number 1 be accepted and approved, and that an election be held' on the 20th day of April, A. D. 1889, for the purpose of voting 20 cents on the $100 for such purposes; and that B. C. Wray be appointed manager in election precinct number 1, at Rayner, and that J.. S. Orr be appointed manager in precinct number 2, at J. S. Orr’s, in school district number 1.” No order was entered by the Commissioners Court directing the sheriff to give notice of such election, as required by article 3733, but on March 19, 1889, the county judge of Stonewall County issued the following notice: “school election notice. ‘ ‘ The State of Texas, County of Stonewall.—To all whom this may concern : Notice is hereby given that there will be held an election on Saturday, the 20th day of April, 1889, in school district number 1, at Eayner, Texas, and at the residence of J. S. Or in said county. The polls in said district will be opened at 10 o’clock on said day for the purpose of determining whether or not there shall be levied an annual tax of two-tenths (two mills) cents on the dollar for school purposes, as provided for by the acte of the special session of the Eighteenth Legislature of the State. [Seal County Court, Stonewall County.] [Signed] “ F. C. Cook, County Judge.” On the back of one of these notices was endorsed the following: “ Came to hand March 19, 1889, and executed by posting and causing to be posted one copy of the within notice at the court house door, and one copy at two other places in said district. This 21st day of March, 1889. [Signed] “J. C. McLaren, Sheriff.” It does not appear what the result of this election was, but the Commissioners Court levied the tax as indicated in the order, and as no question is raised in the briefs as to this defect in the statement of facts, it will be assumed that the result of the election was in favor of making the levy. Appellant tendered the amount of taxes due from him upon his valuation in court, and sought to enjoin appellee, as tax collector, from collecting the remainder of the taxes complained of in his petition. This tender, however, did not include the 20 cents school tax in precinct number 1. The court below refused the injunction as prayed for, and from this judgment this appeal is prosecuted. By the third paragraph of the Act of March 22, 1879 (1 Sayles* Civil Statutes, article 1517a), it is provided, that “the board of equalization shall have power to correct any errors in the assessment of property at any time before the tax is paid on said property;” and in Duck v. Peeler, 74 Texas, 268, it is held, that until a tax payer has exhausted the legal remedy thus given, the courts should refuse him the equitable remedy by injunction, .and in that opinion it is said: “ This is a broad statute, and covers errors in valuation as well as all others.” And again: “The petition failing to show that appellee had been denied this plain remedy, existing when this suit was brought, or that for some reason it was inadequate,, was fatally defective and should have been so held.” Appellant in his petition fails to allege that he had applied to the Commissioners Court to correct the alleged irregularity and over valuation complained of by him, and we are of opinion that if it be conceded that the proceedings of the board of equalization were irregular, and that the proper notice was not given appellant or his agents, yet appellant was provided by this statute with an adequate legal remedy to correct such errors, and if he failed to avail himself thereof, the injunction prayed for by him was correctly denied. If, however, the proceedings of the board were regular and the notice sufficient, then the action of the board was final, and appellant’s petition-showed that he was without remedy, and the injunction for this reason-was correctly denied in so far as it was sought on account of the alleged irregular assessment of his property. Duck v. Peeler, supra. Appellant contends, that after the first Monday in October, 1884, none of the Commissioners Courts had the power to divide their counties into ' school districts. The part of article 3731, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, relied upon to sustain this contention is as follows: “ It shall be the duty of the County Commissioners Courts of all counties not exempted from this section to subdivide their respective counties into school districts at least one month before the first Monday in October, 1884.” In Sutherland on Statutory Construction, section 448, it is said: “ Provisions regulating the duties of public officers and specifying the time for their performance, are in that regard generally directory. Though a statute directs a thing to be done at a particular time, it does not necessarily follow that it may not be done afterwards. In other words, as the cases universally hold, a statute specifying a time within which a public officer is to perform a final act regarding the rights and duties of others is directory, unless the nature of the act to be performed, or the phraseology of the statute is such that the designation of time must be considered as a limitation of the power of the officer.” And again, in section 450: “ The assessors of a school district were directed by statute to assess the district tax within thirty days after the clerk had certified the vote for raising the tax, and it was held to be merely directory, as there were no negative words in the statute limiting their power to make the assessment afterwards.” Such we believe to be the general rule (Flatan v. The State, 56 Texas, 93), and we see nothing in this statute which requires a different construction to be placed upon it. We find no negative words in this provision; and in view of the fact that at the time of its passage many of the counties in this State were unorganized, and could not comply therewith within the time named, it would be unreasonable to hold that such counties were intended to be deprived of all benefit to be derived from our district school system. We are of opinion that the action of the Commissioners Court in subdividing Stonewall County into"" school districts in 1889 was legal. Appellant also complains of the tax of 20 cents on the $100, levied in school district number 1, as being irregular and illegal, because the sheriff, was not ordered by the court to give notice of the election at which said tax was voted, and did not give such notice in the manner required by law. .From the findings of fact it will be seen, that while the sheriff posted up these notices, they were not signed by him, but were signed by the county judge, and there was nothing upon the face of the notices from which an elector could infer that either the sheriff or the Commissioners Court had anything to do with summoning him to vote at this election. Upon its face the notice appeared to be only the act of the county judge. Mr. Cooley, in his work on Taxation, section 335, in speaking of these special elections to vote taxes, says: “All special meetings must be regularly called as the statute may have prescribed, for no one is under obligation to pay heed to any but the legal notice, and those who come together in pursuance of any other do not, for legal purposes, represent the electors. The following are customary regulations: That the meeting shall be called by the officers of the municipality, either on their own motion or on the application of a certain number of the voters or freeholders; that it shall be notified either by a warning delivered or its contents stated to the several voters, or by notice published or posted in a manner particularly indicated by the statute; and that the subjects to be considered at the meeting shall be specified in the warning or notice. With all these provisions there must be careful compliance, and the meeting when held must confine itself strictly to the subjects indicated in the notice or warning.” To sustain this a great number of cases are cited, in a number of which it is held, that a school district tax voted at a meeting not legally called is void. To the same effect is 2 Desty on Taxation, 1126 to 1133; also, see Reynolds Land and Cattle Company v. McCabe, 72 Texas, 57. We are therefore of opinion that the irregularities attending the ordering and giving of the notice of this election as above indicated renders the tax voted thereat illegal and void. It will be noted one of the provisions of the statute requires, that “the Commissioners Court shall order the sheriff to give notice of such election by posting three notices in the district for three weeks before the election, and the sheriff shall obey such order,” and no authority is given the county judge to give such notice, and we are of opinion that the tax payers were not called upon to assemble at his call. Appellant upon the trial below also attacked the election in this precinct, on the ground that twenty of the signers to the petition for this election were not qualified property holding tax paying voters of said district, and to prove this offered in evidence the last assessment roll of Stonewall County. If it be conceded that this could be inquired into after it had been passed upon by the Commissioners Court in ordering the election (which we do not decide; see City of Fort Worth v. Davis, 57 Texas, 225, and Dwyer v. Hackworth, 57 Texas, 245), we are nevertheless of the opinion that the action of the court was correct. If it be desired to show that a certain instrument does not appear of record in a county, it has been held, that the proper practice is to have the custodian of the record make a careful examination, and then prove by him as a witness this fact (Edwards v. Barwise, 69 Texas, 84); and we believe the same rule should apply where it is sought to prove that a name does not appear upon the tax rolls. It would seem to be impracticable to have the entire tax roll introduced in evidence, and the jury required to search through it to see if the name appears thereon. For the error above indicated, let the judgment rendered by the, court below be reversed and here rendered, perpetuating the injunction as to the tax of 20 cents on the §100, levied for school purposes in district number 1, and dissolved as to all other taxes sought to be enjoined in the petition; appellee to pay the costs in this court and in the court below. Reversed and rendered. Delivered February 7, 1893.","SECOND DISTRICT, FEBRUARY, 1893. S. M. Swenson v. J. C. McLaren, Tax Collector. No. 87. 1. Collection of Tax not Enjoined, When. — Equity will not enjoin the collection of a tax on the ground of over valuation of the property by the hoard of equalization, and irregularities in the manner of giving notice of their action, where the complainant fails to allege that he had applied to the Commissioners Court to correct such over valuation and irregularity. 2. Time Within Which Official Act may be Done.—Under article 34.31, Sayles’ Civil Statutes, providing for the subdivision of counties into school districts, “ at least one month before the first Monday in October, 1884,” such subdivision is not invalid because made after the date thus stated, as the statute is in this respect merely directory. 3. Special School Tax—Notice of Election for.—Where the notices that an election would be held to determine the levy of a district school tax were signed by the county judge, and there was nothing upon the face of the notices from which an elector could infer that either the sheriff or the Commissioners Court had anything to do with summoning him to vote, such election is invalid and the tax levied thereunder is illegal. 4. Evidence—Assessment Rolls.—If it be desired to show that a certain name does not appear upon the assessment rolls, the proper practice is to have the custodian of these records make a careful examination, and then to prove such fact by him as a witness, instead of introducing the rolls themselves in evidence.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. At about 10 o’clock on the 4th day of March, 1889, appellee, through his agent, delivered to the agent of appellant at Gainesville, Texas, the following telegram: “Gainesville, Texas, March 4, 1889. “ To A. C. Evans, Mount Vernon, Texas: “ Go to Henry Simpson and get $50. You and your ma come. Luther better. “ W. A. Evans.” At the time of delivering this message to appellant’s agent he was informed of its importance, and was paid the usual charges for its transmission. The message was forwarded by appellant’s agent in due time, and was received at Mount Vernon at 11:35 a. m. of the same day. The delivery of the message to A. C. Evans was delayed at Mount Vernon until about 9 o’clock of the day after its receipt, from the fact that he lived some two or three miles in the country, beyond the free delivery limits of appellant at said place, and its agent at Mount Vernon had not been advised that payment had been made for special delivery in time on the day preceding for it to have been delivered on that day. About an hour after the delivery of the message to appellant’s agent at Gainesville, W. A. Evans, the sender of the message, called at appellant’s office, and was informed by its agent that the message would not be delivered unless an additional payment was made to cover a special delivery, and thereupon Evans paid to said agent $2, the amount demanded for this purpose, and urged upon the agent the necessity for a speedy delivery. The usual time required to send a message from. Gainesville to Mount Vernon was about ten minutes. Had the agent at Gainesville notified the agent at Mount Vernon of the deposit to cover the special delivery, the message could have been delivered on March 4; and had it been so delivered, appellee’s wife, the mother of Luther, referred to in the message, could have reached Gainesville on the evening of March 5, in time to have been with her son Luther about twenty-four hours previous to his death; but not having been delivered until March 5, she was unable to reach her son until the evening of March 6, about twenty minutes after his death. A. C. Evans, the person to whom the message was addressed, anticipating such a message, on March 3 had arranged with appellant’s agent at Mount Vernon, in case such a message for him was received, to deliver the same to a Mrs. Foster, who lived in a short distance of appellant’s office at said place, and who had agreed to attend to the prompt delivery of the same; and had appellant’s agent complied with this arrangement when the message was received on March 4, it would have been delivered to appellee’s wife in time for her to have reached the bedside of her son on March 5, whether any sum had been paid for the special delivery or not. Appellee sued for damages alleged to have been caused to his wife from the mental anguish suffered by her on account of her failure to see her son before his death; and upon the trial the jury awarded him the sum of $5000; and judgment being rendered upon this verdict, appellant prosecutes this appeal. The verdict of the jury finding negligence on the part of appellant in the delivery of said message was well sustained by the evidence. The petition of appellee contained an allegation to the effect that his son Luther, prior to his death, frequently called for his mother, and desired to talk with her before dying, and constantly urged plaintiff to procure, some means to bring her to him; and appellant’s third assignment of error calls in question the action of the court in overruling its special exception to this portion of the petition. We are of opinion that the action of the court was correct. This suit was instituted to recover damage for the mental anguish claimed to have been caused appellee’s wife by her failure to see her son before his death, and we are , not prepared to say that the jury would not be authorized to conclude that this anguish would be increased by the knowledge that her son wished to see her, and was unable to do so. In such ease the damage would be for the injury thereby caused the wife, and not.for any damage that might have been suffered by the son. In this case, however, no injury could have resulted to appellant, as no evidence was offered upon the trial to sustain this allegation. Delivered November 1, 1892. In its eleventh assignment of error appellant complains that the court below refused a special charge requested by it, to the effect that it was not required to deliver a message beyond the free delivery limits until special compensation for this service had been secured to it, and if the jury found such payment was made too late for the message to reach Mount Vernon prior to the regular hour for closing appellant’s office at said point, it would not be guilty of negligence. We think the charge of the court was all if not more than appellant had the right to ask upon this branch of the case, as settled by previous decisions of our Supreme Court. Anderson v. Tel. Co., 84 Texas, 17; Tel. Co. v. Bruner, 19 S. W. Rep., 149; Tel. Co. v. Broesche, 72 Texas, 657; Thomp. on Law of Elec., 300. Appellant’s thirteenth assignment complains of the verdict rendered as being grossly excessive in amount, and as being more in the nature of a punishment of defendant than compensation to plaintiff, and we are of opinion that this assignment is well taken. The verdict in this case was for $5000. We think-the appellee, had the message been promptly delivered, would have reached the bedside of her son about twenty-four hours before his death, but on account of the negligence of appellant she only reached him about twenty minutes after he had died. That her mental anguish was great can not be doubted, but in a case quite similar our Supreme Court held, as we think correctly, a verdict for $4500 such an amount as to shock a sense of justice, and concluded that it must have-been the result of passion or prejudice on the part of the jury; and so-we conclude in this case. Tel. Co. v. Houghton, 82 Texas, 562. We have carefully examined the other assignments of error in appellant’s brief, and are of the opinion that there is nothing in any of them of which it can justly complain. For the failure of the court below to grant to appellant a new trial on account of the excessive verdict of the jury, let the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded.","Western Union Telegraph Company v. W. A. Evans. No. 21. 1. Telegraph Company — Office Hours — Cases Approved. — The cases of Telegraph Company v. Broesche, 72 Texas, 657, and Telegraph Company v. Bruner, 19 Southwestern Reporter, 149, approved and followed, in relation to the liability of telegraph companies for negligent delay of messages received after office hours. 2. Damages — Pleading—Matter of Aggravation. — Where a mother sued for damages for mental anguish resulting from negligence in the delivery Of a telegram that should have brought her in due time to the bedside of her dying son, she was entitled to allege and prove that the son, just before dying, frequently called for her and desired to see her, as a knowledge of this fact increased her own suffering. 3. Damages for Mental Anguish — Excessive Verdict. — By reason of the negligence of a telegraph company in the delivery of a message, a mother did not reach the bedside of her son until a few minutes after his death, instead of twenty-four hours earlier. Meld, that a verdict for $5000 damages for mental suffering occasioned thereby was excessive. Appeal from Cooke. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Stemmons & Field, for appellant. The verdict of the jury herein is grossly excessive in amount, and is more in the nature of a punishment of defendant than a compensation of plaintiff, and is the result of passion and prejudice, and caused by the passionate appeals of plaintiff’s counsel in his concluding argument. E. A. Blanton and Potter, Potter & Eddleman, for appellee. Both the agent sending the message from Gainesville and the one receiving the same at Mount Vernon were told, and they knew before they were so told, of the serious sickness of Luther, and of the relation that he bore to Mary C. Evans, his mother, and A. C. Evans, his brother. Arrangements were made at both ends of the line for the speedy delivery of the message. No special delivery of the message was ever made, but appellant retained the $2 paid to insure the same. Railway v. Smith, 65 Texas, 173; Railway v. Lee, 69 Texas, 560; Railway v. Silliphant, 70 Texas, 631; Railway v. Douglas, 73 Texas, 333."
"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellants sued appellees in two actions of trespass to try title, to recover two tracts of land in Rusk County, of which A. C. Horton was the original grantee. Appellees pleaded not guilty, limitation under the three, five, and ten years statutes, improvements, and a special plea which need not be here stated, as it is not involved in their appeal. The causes were consolidated and tried together, by jury, and verdict and judgment rendered for appellees. Appellants asked for a new trial on the grounds hereinafter discussed, upon the overruling of which they appealed. Appellants showed themselves to be the heirs of A. C. Horton. Appellees claimed under a sale of the land made under an execution against A. C. Horton’s executors. Upon the trial they offered what purported to be a copy of Horton’s will, from the probate records of Wharton County. Appellants objected to its admission, because it was not accompanied by the order of any court admitting the will to probate. Attached to the copy of the document was the affidavit or testimony of one of the subscribing witnesses, purporting to have been taken before the Probate Court of Wharton County, August 26, 1866, proving the proper 'execution of the will; but no order of the court was shown. Appellants objected to the evidence on this ground, and the objection was overruled and they reserved exception. Appellees offered also a duly certified copy of a judgment of the District Court of Wharton County rendered December 9, 1871, in a cause styled T. J. Davis v. Eliza Horton executrix, and I. N. Dennis executor, of A. C. Horton, deceased, and numbered 754, which adjudged that the plaintiff recover of the estate of A. C. Horton, the testator of defendants, the sum of $2030, with interest and costs; and that execution issue to be levied upon the “ effects” of said estate. They then read in evidence, over objection of appellants, an execution issued to Rusk County, January 4, 1875, which recited a judgment in favor of T. J. Davis against Eliza Horton, executrix, and I. N. Dennis, executor, of A. C. Horton, and commanded the sheriff, “that of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the said Eliza Horton, executrix, and I. N. Dennis, executor, of A. C. Horton, deceased,” he make the moneys adjudged. In all other respects the execution correctly described and followed the judgment, which had been put in evidence. Endorsed upon the execution was the return of the sheriff, showing a levy upon and sale of the lands in controversy as the property of “the defendants,” which was also read in evidence. Appellants objected to the execution and levy upon the grounds that the judgment did not warrant the execution, in that the judgment ordered a levy upon the ‘ ‘ effects ’ ’ (personal property) of the estate of Horton, while the execution directs a levy upon lands, etc., of Eliza Horton, executrix, and I. N. Dennis, executor, of A. C. Horton, deceased. These exceptions were overruled by the court, and a bill of exceptions was duly taken. Appellees also read a deed from the sheriff to W. J. Phillips for the lands sold, as above stated, which deed was in accordance with the sale. Appellants objected to this on the same grounds as were the objections taken to the execution. Objections were overruled and exceptions reserved. Appellees also read in evidence the petition of T. J. Davis against Eliza Horton and Dennis, as independent executrix and executor of A. C. Horton, based on a note given by the latter in his lifetime, the judgment in evidence being based on it. To the admission of this also, over their objection, appellants reserved exception, on the ground that all rights secured by the petition were merged in the judgment. These rulings of the court are all assigned as error, and presented in appellants’ brief. Appellees’ title depended on the sale under the execution, with which they connected themselves by mesne conveyances from the purchaser, no evidence of any other title being shown. From these facts we conclude that the court below erred in admitting in evidence the copy of the will of Horton. It is settled in this State, that to authorize the admission of a will in evidence, an order of a proper court admitting it to probate must be produced or its absence accounted for. Lagow v. Glover, 77 Texas, 450. This error, however, is not such as would necessarily lead to a reversal of the judgment, if appellees succeeded in showing a valid sale under the judgment against Horton’s estate. The first point urged against that sale is, that the judgment did not warrant a sale of lands, but only of the effects of the estate, by which, appellants contend, is meant personal property. Delivered October 18, 1892. It is true that the word “ effects,” unaffected by context, is generally held to include only personal property. But when we consider the facts, that no distinction could properly have been made by the court render ing the judgment, between personal and real property of the estate, as both were equally subject to the debt, and that it was not necessary for the judgment to define what property, should be levied upon, further than to indicate that it should be satisfied out of property belonging to the estate, rather than that belonging to the executors individually, we can not conclude that by this direction more than this was intended. Its only purpose was to show that the assets of the estate, and not property of the individuals, who were executors, were to be subjected. The law gave execution and defined the property subject to fit. This execution, however, did not command the sheriff to levy upon property of the estate, but upon that of Mrs. Horton and Dennis, describing them as executrix and executor. The levy was made upon the land, as the property of “ defendants.” The defendants named in the writ were Horton and Dennis. The additional description of them as executrix and executor did not supply the place of a direction in the writ to levy upon and sell property belonging to the estate, and there is not, either in the recitals or commands of the writ, anything to warrant the sheriff in assuming that property of the estate alone was subject, or to authorize him to levy upon such property. In the case of Hart v. McDade, 61 Texas, land of an estate was sold under an execution, commanding the sheriff “ that of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of the said S. C. and B. M. Herndon, executors of the will of J. H. Herndon, deceased, you cause to be made,” etc., just as in this case. There were several defects in that sale, and, after disposing of them, Justice Stay ton says, on page 212: “If, however, all of these things had been shown, the execution would not have authorized the sale in form and manner drawn, for it uses no language indicating that it is to be satisfied out of property belonging to the estate of Herndon, or empowering the officer to seize and sell any property of that estate.” Appellees refer to many authorities to show that an execution will not, after a sale, and in collateral proceeding, be held void for irregularity, such as variances between it and the judgment in names, dates, etc. A clear distinction exists between defects which affect the power to sell, and those which do not. Appellees’ cases are of the latter class. This case belongs, as shown, to the former. Appellants’ objection to the execution, levy, and sheriff’s deed should have been sustained, and as appellees showed no title without those documents. a new trial should have been granted. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded.","Robert J. Horton et al. v. C. J. Garrison et al. No. 15. 1. Will as Evidence. — To authorize the admission of a will in evidence in this State, an order of a proper court admitting it to probate must be produced or its absence accounted for. Ho such order being shown, the will in this case was improperly admitted in evidence, although attached to the will was the affidavit of one of the subscribing witnesses purporting to have been taken before the proper court, which proved its execution. 2. Judgment Sufficient. — It is not a valid objection to the admissibility of a judgment in evidence as a link in a chain of title to land, that it directs the execution to be levied upon the “ effects” of the defendant. Unaffected by the context, the word “effects"" is generally held to include only personal property, but no distinction could properly have been made by the court rendering the judgment between real and personal property, as both were equally subject to the debt, and it was not necessary for the judgment to define what property was to be levied on, further than to indicate that it was to be satisfied out of the property of the defendant. 3. Invalid Execution. — An execution on a judgment which directed that execution issue to be levied upon the effects of the estate of A. C. Horton, deceased, which commands the sheriff, “that of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of Eliza Horton executrix, and I. W. Dennis executor, of A. C. Horton, deceased."" he make the moneys adjudged, did not authorize or empower the sheriff to levy upon the property of the estate. The defendants named in the writ were Horton and Dennis, and the additional description of them as the executrix and executor did not supply the place of a direction in the writ to levy upon the property of the estate, and sale of property of the estate thereunder is invalid. Adhering to Hart v. McDade, 61 Texas, 212. 4. Irregularities in Execution. — A clear distinction exists between defects in an execution which affect the power to sell and those which do not. Many authorities are referred to, to show that an execution after a sale, in a collateral proceeding, will not be held void for irregularities, such as a variance between it and the judgment in names, dates, etc. But these authorities belong to the latter class; this case to the former. Appeal from Rusk. Tried below before Hon. A. J. Booty The opinion states the case. Martin Casey and John B. Arnold, for appellants. 1. The court erred in admitting in evidence, over the objections of the plaintiffs, a paper purporting to be the last will of A. C. Horton, on which is an affidavit by C. B. Betts, made before J. W. Yeazey, chief justice Wharton County, August 27, 1866, because there appears to be no judgment of the Probate Court adjudging said paper to be the last will and testament of A. C. Horton. Box v. Lawrence, 14 Texas, 555; Lagow v. Glover, 77 Texas, 450. 2.

Stats., arts. 206, 207; 37 Texas, 19; 6 Bac. Abr., 28. (2) Because the execution commanded a levy on property of Eliza Horton and I. N.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This action was brought in the name of the State of Texas on a liquor dealer’s bond, for a breach of the condition of the bond that the dealer would keep a quiet house. The petition set out the bond, which is dated March 12, 1891. The following are the only allegations of the breach of the bond: “ That notwithstanding the bond and obligation of the said Whitcomb and his sureties as aforesaid, heretofore, to-wit, on the — day of -, 1891, in violation of his said obligation to the State, the said W. M. Whitcomb did not keep a quiet and orderly house or place of business for the sale of malt liquors capable of producing intoxication, and did allow therein music, loud and boisterous talking, and the use of indecent and vulgar language, and did allow large crowds of negro men and women to assemble in and near his house and place of business, all of which was in violation of his said bond to the State as aforesaid; whereby the defendants have become liable,” etc. The petition also alleged that the bond was executed for the purpose of enabling the defendant Whitcomb to procure a retail license to sell malt liquors capable of producing intoxication, in the county of Anderson, State of Texas, and that he did procure said license on the 12th day of March, 1891. Trial was had to a jury, and verdict and judgment were returned and rendered for the State. Defendants filed motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial, which were overruled by the court. From the statement of the facts in the record, we make the following conclusions: 1. Defendant Whitcomb executed the bond set out in the petition, with the other defendants as sureties, and obtained a license as alleged. 2. Defendant conducted his business of retail dealer of malt liquors in a house in the city of Palestine, Anderson County. In the front part of the house he sold groceries, and in the back part of it had a bar for the sale of beer. Just in the rear of defendant’s store house, and across an alley about twelve feet wide, there was an arbor arranged with tables, at which persons sometimes sat and drank beer, which was sold in the house and drunk in the arbor. A door opened from the side of the house next to the arbor. Defendant Whitcomb had control of the arbor. It was shown that during May, 1891, music was played some three or four times in the arbor. A witness also testified, that there was during the same month loud and boisterous talk and vulgar and indecent language in the house. This, however, Whitcomb denied. 1. There was no error in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment. While the petition was subject to special exception, it would have been good on general demurrer. Maier v. The State, ante, p. 296. 2. The court charged the jury as follows: “ The words house or place of business would include not only the house or room in which the liquor was kept for sale, but any arbor or structure kept by defendant for the purpose of the business of selling liquors. It would not include any other house or structure, however, not kept by defendant and not used for the purpose of such business. It would not, if such other structure was so kept and used for purposes of the business, be necessary that the liquor should be actually sold therein. Therefore, if you find from the evidence that in defendant’s place of business, as just explained, music, loud and boisterous talking, yelling, or indecent or vulgar language was allowed, used, or practiced, you will find for the plaintiff the sum of $500.” It is contended, that this charge is erroneous, because “ on the weight of evidence, in so far as it defined a place of business, and in effect instructed the jury, that defendant Whitcomb’s house or place of business included the arbor near by, though no liquors of any kind were ever sold in said arbor; and instead of so instructing the jury, the court should have submitted an issue of fact whether said arbor was or not defendant’s place of business.” The charge left it to the jury to say whether or not the arbor was kept by the defendant for the purpose of the business of selling liquors, with the instruction, that it would not be necessary that the liquor should be actually sold therein. This was a correct enunciation of the law, and the charge is adapted to the facts proved on the trial. It is immaterial whether the beer was sold at the bar or in the arbor. 3. Proof that the defendant sold beer in the back part of his store, when it was shown that he had obtained a license for the sale of malt liquors in quantities less than a quart, was sufficient to support the verdict and judgment, if it should be shown that he did not keep a quiet house. It will be presumed, in the absence of other evidence, that the beer was sold lawfully in accordance with the license, and the court will judicially know that beer is a malt liquor. Maier v. The State, ante, p. 296. It was shown by the evidence, that defendant kept a store, in the front part of which he sold groceries, and in the back part sold beer, which was drunk in the arbor. The jury could very correctly find that Whit-comb kept a house or place for the sale of malt liquors in quantities less than a quart, and that the arbor was a part of his place of business. The verdict is fully supported by the evidence, and there being no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 16, 1893. Justice Williams did not sit in this case.","W. H. Whitcomb et al. v. The State of Texas. No. 142. 1. Pleading — Petition on Liquor Dealer’s Bond. — See petition set out in this case for a pleading held good against a motion in arrest of judgment in a suit to recover the penalty of a liquor dealer’s bond, for failing to keep an ■orderly house. 2. Breach of Bond, Charge on.—Defendant sold groceries in the front room of his house, and in the back part of it had a bar for the sale of beer, and In the rear of the store house an arbor furnished with chairs, where beer was drank and music played. The jury were told that the place of business would include any arbor or structure kept by defendant for the purpose of the business ■of selling liquors, but it would not include any other house or structure not kept by defendant and used for such business; and that if music, loud and boisterous talking, yelling, or indecent or vulgar language was allowed, used, or practiced, to find for the plaintiff. This charge was a correct enunciation of the law, and not on the weight of evidence. 3. Evidence Sufficient.—Having obtained a license to sell liquors in quantities less than a quart, proof that it was sold in the back part of his house, and that he did not keep a quiet house, was sufficient. It is presumed that the beer was lawfully sold, and the court judicially knows that beer is a malt liquor. Appeal from Anderson. Tried below before Hon. F. A. Williams. Burnett & Gardner, for appellants. 1. The petition failed to allege any breach of the bond sued on, in that it did not state the time so as to show that the facts complained of occurred after the execution of the bond; and it is not alleged that defendant Whitcomb sold liquors, etc., in Anderson County, or otherwise committed a breach of the bond sued on.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. This suit was instituted by appellant, on the 2nd day of February, 1889, in the District Court of Karnes County, Texas, upon a written live stock contract, which was made a part of appellant’s petition, to recover from appellee the sum $1200 damages to 109 .head of stock, which appellee received from appellant on May 11, 1888, at Beeville, Texas, to be transported by appellee over its line of railway from said Beeville to Junction City, Kansas, under said written live stock ■contract. Appellee answered, and admitted that the stock mentioned were shipped under said written live stock contract, but set up that its line of railway on said route only extended to the city of San Antonio, Texas, and contended that by the terms of said written live stock contract its liability as a common carrier ceased upon the transportation of said stock to San Antonio; and that the injuries and damages to said stock resulted while the stock was in possession of another carrier. The case being tried by the court without the intervention of a jury, judgment was rendered for appellee against appellant. 1. On the lltli day of May, 1888, appellant and appellee entered into the following contract of shipment of the stock in controversy: “ THE SAN ANTONIO & ARANSAS PASS RAILWAY COMPANY. “ Rules and Regulations for the Transportation of Live Stock. “ No station master of this company has any power or authority to bind this company in regard to shipment of live stock except by written •contract, in the following form; neither has such station master power or authority to agree to furnish cars to be loaded with live stock, at any particular time, or to agree to furnish, under any circumstances, any particular class or kind of cars. “ Live stock will be taken in less than carload lots between points within the State of Texas at the rate of one-half of 1 cent per 100 pounds, actual weight, per mile, the rate in no instance to be less than 30 cents per 100 pounds. Between other points, the rates on less than carload shipments will be subject to the charge for estimated weights as provided by joint Texas classification in its application to interstate business. “ The San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company will not assume any liability over the actual value, and in no case exceeding 8100 per head on horses and valuable stock, except by special agreement. “ For the purpose of taking care of stock, the owner or men in charge, in proportion to the number of cars, as endorsed hereon, will be passed on the train with it, and all persons thus passed are at their own risk of any personal injury whatever, and will agree to sign release to that effect endorsed on the contract. “ LIVE STOCK CONTRACT. “ Beeville Station, May 11th, 1888. . “ This agreement, made between the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, of the first part, and H. H. Swank, of the «second part, witnesseth: That whereas the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company transports live stock as per above rules and regulations, all of which are hereby made a part of this contract by mutual agreement between the parties hereto; now, therefore, for the considerations and mutual covenants and conditions herein contained, the said first party will transport for the said second party the live stock described below, and the parties in charge thereof, as herein provided, viz.,-carloads of horses, said to contain-head of such stock, from the station where this contract is executed to Junction City, Kansas, station, the end of the line of road operated by the party of the first part on the route over which such stock are way-billed, there to be transferred to the railway company over which said live stock are way-billed for further transportation by said railway company, the said stock being way-billed through and consigned to H. H. Swank at Junction City station; and the party of the first part covenants and agrees that the freight charge from point of shipment to final destination shall be only the sum of-dollars per carload, the same being a through rate lower than the local rates which might be lawfully charged by party of the first part, and for and in consideration of which through rate and the guaranty thereof by the party of the first part, the party of the second part hereby covenants and agrees as follows: “ First. That he does hereby release said first party from any and all liability for delay in shipping said stock after delivery thereof to its agent, and from any delay in receiving«same after being tendered to its agent. “ Second. That he does accept for the transportation of said stock the cars tendered him by party of the first part, and agrees that they are in all things satisfactory to him; and he hereby assumes all risk of injury which the animals or either of them may receive in consequence of any of them being wild, unruly, or weak, or of their maiming each other or themselves, or in consequence of heat or suffocation or other ill effects of being crowded in the cars, or on account of being injured by the burning of hay, straw, or other material used by the person or persons in charge of said stock for feeding or bedding said stock or otherwise; and all risk of escape or robbery of said stock, or of loss or damage from any other cause or thing not resulting from the negligence of the agents of the party of the first part, said negligence not to be assumed, but to be proved by the party of the second part. “ Third. That the party of the second part will load, unload, and reload said stock at his own risk, and feed, water, and attend to the same at his own expense and risk while it is in the stock yards of the party of the first part awaiting shipment, and while on cars, or at feeding or transfer points, or where it may be unloaded for any purpose. “ Fourth.» That party of the second part will see that said stock are securely placed in the cars furnished, and that the cars are safely and properly fastened so as to prevent the escape of said stock therefrom. ‘ ‘ Fifth. That in case the party of the first part shall furnish laborers to assist in loading and unloading said stock at any point, such laborers shall be subject to the orders of the person representing the shipper in charge of said stock, and shall be deemed employes of the party of the second part while so assisting. “ Sixth. That in case the party of the first part should for any reason undertake to water and feed said stock, .it shall not be liable for insufficient supplies nor the imperfect discharge of said undertaking, it being expressly understood that the same is not a duty imposed upon it as a carrier of said stock. “ Seventh. And the party of the second part further agrees, that as a condition precedent to his right to recover any damages for any loss or injury to said stock, he, or his agent, the person in charge of said stock, shall give notice in writing of his claim therefor, and the full amount of such loss or damage, to the station agent of the party of the first part at the station hereinbefore named as the end of the line of the party of the first part, before said stock is removed from station, and before said stock is mingled with other stock or delivered to any connecting line of railway. “ Eighth. It is further stipulated and agreed between the parties hereto, that, as the live stock mentioned herein is to be transported over the road or roads of other railway companies and in other cars than those of this company, and as the party of the first part is only to transport said stock to the aforesaid station named as the end of its line on the route over which said stock is to be shipped, the party of the first part is only to be bound for the transportation of said stock to said station; it being understood and agreed by both parties hereto that the only purpose of making this contract is, that the party of the first part shall transport said stock to said station and protect the through rate of freight named herein for the benefit of the party of the second part; and the party of the first part shall in no manner be responsible for any loss or injuries occurring to said stock after the same has left the line of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, nor be responsible for the carriage beyond. “ Ninth. It is further expressly agreed by the party of the second part, that the other railway lines over which said stock are way-billed in order to reach their destination, having participated in making said through rate of freight of which the party of the second part has the benefit hereunder, when they receive said stock for transportation under this contract shall, like the party of the first part, not be responsible for injuries or loss occurring beyond their respective lines of road, and shall each be entitled to the same notice of loss or damage occurring upon their respective lines as is herein provided for the party of the first part, to be given to the agent of each railway company at the station ending the run of said stock over such road. “ Tenth. The second party further agrees, for the consideration aforesaid, that in case of total loss of any of said stock from any cause for which the carrier will be liable to pay for the same, the actual cash value at the time and place of shipment, but in no case to exceed $100 per head, shall be taken and deemed as full compensation therefor; and in case of injury or partial loss the amount of damage to be recovered shall be in the same proportion. And in the event of any proceeding in court to recover damages upon this shipment, said actual cash value at the time and place of shipment and not at the place of destination shall control the court and jury in estimating, the amount which may be due to the shipper. “ Eleventh. This contract does not entitle the holder or other parties to ride in the cars of any train except the train in which his stock referred to is drawn or taken. Neither does it entitle him (and the party of the second part, named in this contract, so expressly stipulates, admits, and agrees) to return passage from Junction City, Kansas, unless this said contract is presented within twenty days from the date hereof; and that no person except the party of the second part, and parties who accompany him in charge of said stock for the purpose of assisting him in taking care of same, as specified in and upon said contract, and does not include women, infants, or other persons unable to do and perform the services required of parties in charge, as expressed on this contract, shall be entitled to such return passage within the said twenty days; the object, purpose, and intent of the return passage being to enable the said party of the second part hereto, or his men in charge, as expressed in contract, and no other person, to return to Beeville, Texas, thereon at any time within twenty days from date hereof, and not thereafter. “ The evidence that the said party of the second part, after a full understanding thereof, assents to all the conditions of the foregoing contract, is his signature hereto. “ D. B. Saffold, ‘ ‘ Station Master at Beeville Station, San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company. “ H. H. Swank, “ Shipper. “Witness: H. C. Nash. “(Executed in duplicate.)” 2. The line of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, on the route from Beeville, Texas, to Junction City, Kansas, terminated at San Antonio, Texas. 3. The injuries and damage to the stock occurred at Taylor, Texas, on the line of the International & Great Northern Railway Company, a line of railway on the route from Beeville, Texas, to Junction City, Kansas. 4. The amount of damages sustained by appellant is the sum of $1090. The appellant contends that the court erred in permitting evidence to be introduced, over his objection, to the effect that San Antonio, Texas, is the terminus of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway, for the reason that the contract of shipment names Junction City, Kansas, as the station at the end of the line of railway operated by appellee, and that the effect of such evidence would be to vary and change the terms of the written contract; and that the court erred in giving such effect to the contract as would terminate the liability of appellee at San Antonio, Texas, and in not holding it liable under the contract for damages resulting on the entire line of route from Beeville, Texas, to Junction City, Kansas. These are the main questions in the case, although others are suggested by assignments of error, which we will not notice, as not necessary to a disposition of the case. The court below, in admitting evidence showing that San Antonio, Texas, was the terminus of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway, evidently regarded, from the entire range of all the provisions of the contract of shipment, that the terminal point of that railway was uncertain as gathered front the contract, and that in this respect the contract was ambiguous, and that such testimony was admissible as tending to give it certainty. If the contract in this respect is uncertain, the evidence was admissible; and the court properly construed the contract, as such evidence would not have the effect of changing the terms of the contract, but simply gives effect to its terms and renders that certain which was otherwise uncertain. If there is no uncertainty in the contract in this respect, the evidence was not admissible, and the court erred in its construction of the contract. By reference to the contract, it will be seen that it provides that the horses are to be shipped from Beeville station to “Junction City, Kansas, the end of the line of road operated by the party of the first part [the appellee] on the route over which such stock are way-billed, there to be transferred to the railway company over which said live stock are way-billed for further transportation by said railway company, the stock being way-billed through and consigned to H. H. Swank at Junction City station.” This is the provision of the contract that appellant contends fixes Junction City, Kansas, as the terminal point on appellee’s line of road. The eighth and ninth subdivisions of the contract of shipment are as follows: “ Eighth. It is further stipulated and agreed between the parties hereto, that as the live stock mentioned herein is to be transported over the road or roads of other railway companies and in other cars than in those of this company, and as the party of the first part is only to transport said stock to the aforesaid station named as the end of its line on the route over which said stock is to be shipped, the party of the first part is only to be bound for the transportation of said stock to said station; it being understood and agreed by both parties hereto that the only purpose of making this contract is, that the party of the first part shall transport said stock to said station and protect the through rate of freight named herein for the benefit of the party of the second part; and the party of the first part shall in no manner be responsible for any loss or injuries occurring to said stock after the same has left the line of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company, nor to be responsible for the carriage beyond. “ Ninth. It is further expressly agreed by the party of the second part, that the other railway lines over which said stock is way-billed in order to reach their destination, having participated in making said through rate of freight, of which the party of the second part has the benefit hereunder, when they receive said stock for transportation under this contract shall, like the party of the first part, not be responsible for injuries or loss occurring beyond their respective lines of road.” It is seen by these provisions of the contract, that it is expressly agreed that the stock is to be shipped over lines of road other than that owned or controlled by appellee, and that appellee shall in no manner be responsible for any loss or injuries occurring to said stock after the same has left the line of the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Kailway Company, nor responsible for carriage beyond. Delivered December 7, 1892. It is not questioned but that Junction City, Kansas, was the final destination of the stock shipped. It is evident, from the two provisions of the contract last quoted, that the stock, in order to reach their final destination, would have to pass over roads other than those owned or controlled by appellee. If such was not the case, why these provisions of the contract that in effect so provide ? If the stock was to be carried through on the line of road owned or controlled by appellee, then these provisions of the contract are out of place, and express a fact that is not true, and provide for a contingency that in no possible event could in the nature of things occur. We can not assume that the parties to this contract intended that these provisions should not be given a meaning as well as other parts of the contract; and it is our duty in construing the contract to view it as a whole and give it such meaning as will best effectuate the intention of the parties to the instrument. That provision of the contract stating that Junction City, Kansas, is the end of the line of road operated by appellee is evidently inconsistent with those provisions of the contract stating that the stock must go over other lines of road in order to reach their destination — that is, Junction City. This inconsistency does not produce such an uncertainty as would render the contract void, but we think effect can be given to all of its provisions, and it can be explained upon the hypothesis that Junction City was simply named in the contract of through shipment as the place of final destination of the stock, and that appellee should not be responsible for damages resulting beyond the terminus of its own line, which is shown by the evidence to be San Antonio, Texas. We find no error in the record, and affirm the judgment of the court below. Affirmed","H. H. Swank v. San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company. No. 43. I. Construction of Contract. — Example of application of the rules, that in the construction of a contract the whole instrument is to be regarded, and one part interpreted by another, and that every part should take effect, if possible, consistent with the rules of law and the intent of the parties. 2. Same. — See example where an inconsistent statement was disregarded in-view of the manifest intent of the parties as expressed in other parts of the contract. 3. Same. — In a shipping contract executed by the San Antonio & Aransas Pass Railway Company for the transportation of horses from Beeville station on its line to Junction City, Kansas, it was recited that Junction City was the end of the roa'd operated by said railway company. The contract also recited that its end was at San Antonio, Texas, limiting its liability to losses on its own line. In suit for damages to the freight while on a connecting line, held. that, the entire contract corrected the misrecital as to the end of the line of railway-of said company. Appeal from Karnes.

This being a suit upon a written contract, in which it is expressly stipulated that appellee operates the line of railway from Beeville, Texas, to Junction City, Kansas, and that its road terminated at Junction City, Kansas, it was not competent for appellee to plead that its line of road terminated at any other point than at Junction City, Kansas, without alleging some fraud or mistake in the execution of same. 2.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. R. D. Simonton brought this suit in the District Court of Montgomery County, against the Gulf, Colorado <fe Santa Fe Railway Company, to recover damages for depredations upon his crops and premises by stock, which, as alleged in the petition, entered said premises through openings left by defendant in the construction of its railway. There was no proof that stock entered by any other opening left by the defendant than over the platform of its depot building, which extended about four feet into plaintiff’s enclosure. With respect to this opening, after alleging that the company was operating its railway through the enclosed premises of plaintiff, consisting of about 200 acres of land, including farm, pasture, garden, truck patches, lawn, barns, lots, yard, residence, etc., all adjacent to the town of Montgomery, and had negligently and wrongfully torn down and destroyed and removed plaintiff’s fence; and having specified two other openings left unguarded, the petition averred, that “ another of said openings in plaintiff’s said fence and enclosure is where defendant company unlawfully and willfully tore down and removed plaintiff’s fence, and constructed and extended its depot platform from its depot on the outside of said enclosure to a point on the inside of said enclosure, and this place said defendant company did then negligently leave open, and has ever since negligently left open, an easy passage way for stock of all kinds into said enclosed premises of plaintiff; and did then and there negligently fail and omit, and has ever since negligently failed and omitted, to guard or protect said place with a cattle guard, or hinder the invasion of said premises by stock through said openings;” and further averred, that by the construction of its depot platform into said enclosure from the outside, a broad, easy, and inviting opening was made into the premises for stock of all kinds, to-wit, “ a low, broad, flat structure, or apron walk, made of pine lumber, and not exceeding fourteen inches in heighth, upon which hogs and cattle and all other stock can and do easily enter and pass into said enclosure.” It was averred, that plaintiff had often requested the defendant to erect cattle guards and restore said fence, or to provide some adequate means or devices to protect his said farm and premises against the invasion and depredation of stock, invited and made easy by said openings. Damages were laid at 81500 actual damages, which were itemized under quite a number of heads. Exemplary damages were also claimed by reason of defendant’s alleged gross and willful negligence in failing after-repeated notices to fix the openings; but the portion of the petition setting up exemplary damages, on exception made by defendant, was stricken out by the court. Defendant pleaded also contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff, and want of due care. An exception in the nature of a general demurrer, made by the plaintiff to the plea of contributory negligence, was sustained by the court, and so much of the answer stricken out. Trial was had without a jury, and the court rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff for $700. Defendant’s plea of contributory negligence was, that plaintiff, by building a few yards of fence around defendant’s passenger depot, could have prevented all the damages. The pleading does not advise us as to whether or not the plaintiff had a right to build the fence so as to close the passage over the platform, nor of other facts that might be pertinent to the inquiry as to whether or not the fence could have been built; but we are of opinion that it was good on general demurrer, and that the court erred in striking it out on plaintiff’s exception. As far as shown by the evidence, defendant’s plea of contributory negligence might have been good. Plaintiff testified: “I have a farm and premises joining next to the depot of defendant in the town of Montgomery. Defendant’s road runs through it. Defendant’s passenger platform at said depot extends [upon] the line of the east fence enclosing my premises, and into the same about four feet, said platform being about two feet above the ground, and hogs and cattle walk over the said platform into my premises, and have been doing so continually for about fourteen months.” There was no evidence that stock ever entered plaintiff’s premises through any hole in his fence made by defendant, except over said platform. There was no other evidence as to the position of the depot and fence, and it does not appear but that plaintiff built his fence after the depot building had been put up. But if we may assume that the back part of the platform extends about four feet into the pasture, that the building was constructed after the fence had been built, and that the track at this place lay outside the pasture, we do not think that the statute with reference to cattle guards would be applicable in such case. It is certainly not shown by the evidence to be applicable. Rev. Stats., art. 4240; Railway v. Young, 60 Texas, 202; Railway v. Adams, 63 Texas, 204. The amount of damages as found by the court is clearly excessive. Plaintiff could not recover more for any particular item of damage than he sustained as alleged in his petition; and when the allegation was that his pasture had been damaged §50, he could not recover more than that sum for damage to his pasture on proof of $200 or $300 damage to it. It was shown by the evidence, that there was a cross or partition fence between plaintiff’s pasture and his field fence, which he testified was a very poor fence and did not turn hogs. He said he. could have repaired it and protected the property, but he did not regard it as his business, but looked upon it as the duty of the defendant railway to have fixed its exit so that his premises on the inside would have been protected. If this fence could have been repaired at a moderate cost, and the crops thereby protected, it was plaintiff’s duty to have done so; and failing to do it, his measure of damages would be only a sufficient amount of money to have made such repairs. It is hardly necessary to say that plaintiff should not be allowed to recover for crops that belonged to his tenant, nor for damages thereto caused by stock getting in at other places than over the platform. The method of getting at the value of crops destroyed has been considered in several cases. Railway v. McGowan, 73 Texas, 355; Railway v. Pape, 73 Texas, 502. If the witness should qualify himself as an expert, his opinion as to the value of a crop at a particular stage of development should be received. Railway v. Borsky, decided by this court on March 16, 1893 [ante, p. 545]. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 23, 1893.","Gulp, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. R. D. Simonton. No. 120. 1. Contributory Negligence — Sufficient Allegations of.—Plaintiff sued appellant company for damages for depredations on his crops by stock, which entered his premises over the depot platform, which was partly within and partly outside his enclosure, and was not protected by cattle guard or otherwise. Defendant's plea of contributory negligence was, that the plaintiff, by building a few yards of fence around defendant’s passenger depot, could have prevented all the damages. This plea was good against a general demurrer, and the court below erred in striking it out on plaintiff’s exception. 2. Cattle Guards.—The platform extends about four feet inside the pasture, and the track is outside. The statute with reference to cattle guards would not be applicable in such a case, and it was not shown by the evidence to be applicable. 3. Allegation and Proof — Damages. — The amount of damages found by the court is clearly excessive. Plaintiff could not recover more for any particular item of damages than he alleges in his petition he sustained; and when the allegation was that his pasture had been damaged $50, he could not recover more than that sum by proof of $200 or $300 damage to it. 4. Duty of Plaintiff to Protect Himself Against Damage.—There was a partition fence between plaintiff’s pasture and field, which was a poor fence and did not turn hogs. He could have repaired it, but did not. If it could have been repaired at a moderate cost, and the crops thereby protected, it was the plaintiff’s duty to have done so; and failing to do it, his measure of damages would be a sufficient amount of money to have made such repairs. 5. Crops of Tenants Destroyed.—Plaintiff should not be allowed to recover for crops that belonged to his tenant, nor for damages thereto caused by stock getting in at other places than over the platform. 6. Value of Crops.—If the witness should qualify himself asan expert,his opinion as to the value of a crop at a particular stage of development should he received. Appeal from Montgomery. Tried below before Hon. James Mastebson. C. K. Lee and J. W. Terry, for appellant. 1. Where a tort is committed, the law makes it the duty of the injured party to make all reasonable efforts to reduce his damages as much as practicable. The evidence in this case shows that by the exercise of a very little care and trouble plaintiff could have prevented the greater part of his injury. 1 Sedg. on Meas, of Dam., 7 ed., 167-171; Loker v.

The amount of damages is excessive and not supported by the evidence, in this: The amount of damages suffered by the plaintiff, as testified by himself, only amounted to 8660, and the court rendered judgment against the said defendant for 8700. Plaintiff alleged in his petition that his pasture was damaged 850, and testified that it was damaged $200 to 8300. Under his petition he was only entitled to recover 850 for said item; and if he were allowed the full amount of damages shown by his testimony on all other items testified to by him, he would only have been entitled to judgment for $410, while he received judgment for $700. 1 W. & W. C. C., sec. 581, and cases cited; Gay v. Raines, 21 Texas, 460; 3 Willson’s C. C., sec. 192. 3. The undisputed evidence shows, that part of the crops which plaintiff testified to having been damaged were raised by. a tenant on plaintiff’s place, and the evidence shows no assignment of the same to the plaintiff; therefore plaintiff was not entitled to recover for the same. Railway v. Bayliss, 62 Texas, 570. 4. A witness is not allowed to give his opinion of the amount of damages which a party sustains from a given act or omission. It is the province of the court or jury to assess damages according to the rule of law, and witnesses are allowed only to furnish the data upon which the amount is arrived at. 1 Suth. on Dam., 794; 1 W. & W. C. C., secs, 461, 1109. W. P. McComb, for appellee. 1. “A railroad company whose railway passes through a field or enclosure, is required by law to place a good and sufficient cattle guard or stop at the points of entering such field or enclosure, and keep them in good repair.” Rev. Stats., art. 4240. “ Such cattle guards or stops shall in all cases be so constructed and kept in repair as to protect such fields and enclosures from the depredations of stock of every description.” Rev. Stats., art. 4242. “ Should any such company neglect to construct such cattle guards or stops and keep the same in repair as required by law, such company shall be liable to the party injured by such neglect for all damages that may result from such neglect, to be recovered by suit in any court having jurisdiction.” Rev. Stats., art. 4244. And it was not the duty of plaintiff in this case to become a trespasser on defendant’s right of way and run a fence between its depot and its track. Railway v. Adams, 63 Texas, 200; Railway v. Young, 60 Texas, 201. 2. Plaintiff alleged his actual damages to be $1500, and he and others testified to the destructions, devastations, injuries, harassment, expenses, and annoyances to which he was subjected, and furnished the data upon which the court, hearing all the evidence and to whom the whole case was submitted, arrived at the amount of damages assessed. There are numerous items of damage, general and special, alleged in the petition and shown in the evidence, which plaintiff in* his testimony did not specifically estimate. Railway v.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This writ of error was prosecuted by W. Y. Robertson to the Court of Appeals from a judgment rendered in the County Court of Hill County, against Tom Sanders as principal and said Robertson and another as sureties on an injunction bond. On May 9, 1891, the judgment was affirmed by an oral opinion of the Court of Appeals, and a rehearing was granted. Defendants in error, Schneider & Davis, in 1884, brought an attachment suit in Johnson County against Hudspeth & Co., in which they caused to be seized under a writ of attachment the property of said Hudspeth & Co. in Johnson County, and also certain alleged property of said Tom Sanders, in Hill County. Sanders, after an ineffectual attempt, by a proceeding under the statute for the trial of the rights of property, to wrest the Hill County property from the attachment levied thereon, in the spring of 1885 obtained a writ of injunction, with plaintiff in error as one of his sureties on the injunction bond, by which injunction writ the judgment rendered against him in the suit for the trial of the rights of property in the sum of three hundred and odd dollars was enjoined. After this injunction was obtained, defendants in error recovered judgment in their attachment suit in Johnson County against Hudspeth & Co. for several hundred dollars, to which was applied a credit — resulting from the sale of the property attached in that county — which reduced the amount due on that judgment to about $250. Thereafter, on the 17th day of March, 1887, a judgment was rendered, from which this writ of error is prosecuted, dissolving said injunction, and against said Tom Sanders and his sureties on the injunction bond, W. Y. Robertson and E. Y. Taylor, in the sum of $252.52, the amount remaining unpaid on the Johnson County judgment. As a ground for this recovery, Schneider & Davis alleged in their answer the amount due them upon the Johnson County judgment, without alleging any damage or injury resulting from the granting of the injunction. Delivered November 29, 1892. The record contains no statement of facts, although the trial seems to have been upon both pleading and proof. It is perfectly clear, however, under the well settled rule adopted by our Supreme Court, that the judgment is without support in the pleadings, and must therefore be reversed. Reasons for this conclusion may be found in the following cases, to-wit: Railway v. White, 57 Texas, 130; Avery & Son v. Stewart, 60 Texas, 154; Ferguson v. Herring, 49 Texas, 130; Fernandez v. Casey, 77 Texas, 452. The judgment will therefore be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","W. Y. Robertson v. Schneider & Davis. No. 724. Injunction Bond— Pleadings Necessary to' Recovery' Thereon.— Where property is levied on to satisfy a judgment, and one who is not a party to the judgment obtains an injunction restraining the sale of the property, the plaintiffs in the judgment are not entitled, upon a dissolution of the injunction, to recover against the principal and sureties in the injunction bond the amount of their judgment then remaining unpaid, without alleging damage or injury resulting from the grant of the injunction. Error from the County Court of Hill. Tried below before Hon. A. W. Parham. Smith & Davis, for plaintiff in error. There are no such pleadings in the case as warrrant the judgment against the sureties on the injuction bond. The 10 per cent damages allowed by law on the amount of the debt is the measure of the damages to which Schneider & Davis were entitled on the dissolution of the injunction, unless by pleading and evidence a necessity for further relief had been shown. All that is stated by them is that they recovered judgment against Hudspeth & Co., and that $252.52 and interest is unpaid. The principal in the bond, Tom Sanders, is not a party to that judgment, and does not in his injunction suit ask that it be interfered with in any way, except that certain goods be not sold under execution issued thereon. In order for Schneider & Davis to hold Sanders and his sureties liable, they should have averred what said goods were worth at the time the injuction was granted, and that by reason of its having been granted the goods had become worthless, in whole or in part, and if in part, to what extent, and that their judgment remained unpaid to a certain amount, and that said goods were the only property of which they knew belonging to said Hudspeth & Co. subject to their judgment.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. This is a suit, under the statute, for the trial of the right of property in certain machinery and live stock, which were owned by. one W. F. Bachman and transferred by him to O. F. Parks. A short time after this transfer, appellants W. C. Howard & Co. sued out a writ of attachment against Bachman and had the same levied upon the property transferred to Parks as aforesaid. . Parks filed his claimant’s bond as required by law, with I. L. Dunn and C. A. Arnold as sureties, which bond was dated April 14, 1885. In the issues between the parties in the suit for the trial of the right of property arises the question as to whether or not the transfer from Bachman to Parks was in fraud of the creditors of the former. It seems that Bachman and Parks were in partnership, and Parks claimed that a large amount of money he had furnished to be used in the partnership business had been fraudulently appropriated by Bachman to his own use and to the payment of his individual debts, without having been applied to the partnership business, and that when he learned this he had a settlement with said Bachman, in which the latter was found to be indebted to him for the money so misapplied in the sum of $5400, and the transfer of the property in controversy was made in consideration of a credit upon this indebtedness to an amount more than the full value thereof. Appellant’ s contention was, that the transfer from Bachman to Parks was only colorable, to enable the latter to hold the property from creditors of the former, who at that time was alleged to be insolvent, and that the pretended consideration from Parks to Bachman was much less than the value of the property; also, that the pretended transfer from Bachman to Parks was fictitious and fraudulent, and if any indebtedness existed at all it could only be ascertained by a settlement of the partnership business, which had not been had. The evidence upon the issue of fraud thus raised was very conflicting, and a verdict for either party thereon would be well sustained. In September, after the transfer from Bachman to Parks in April, the latter instituted suit to recover of the former the $5400 indebtedness alleged to be due him as above set forth, and in this suit he gave Bachman credit for the consideration he was to pay for the property in controversy under the transfer thereof to him; and on the trial of the suit between appellants and appellee for the trial of the right of property, Parks was permitted, over the objection of appellants, to introduce in evidence his own petition in his suit against Bachman above set forth, with a lengthy exhibit thereto attached, showing the state of accounts between them, and the recital of a credit given to Parks for this property upon said account, for the purpose of rebutting the charge of collusion, alleged by appellants to exist between Parks and Bachman, resulting in such transfer. The explanation made by the court below for admitting this evidence is endorsed on the bill of exceptions as follows: “Approved, with the explanation that the same [referring to the petition and exhibits aforesaid]' were offered to rebut the presumption of collusion charged to exist between defendant and Bachman, and was supplemented by the evidence of D. T. Bledsoe, a reputable lawyer, to the effect that Bachman was represented by him, and that the issues in said case were contested by him, and also to show that defendant had credited his demand with $2000, the amount of his several purchases.” That the admission of this evidence was error we think perfectly clear from the reasons given by the learned judge for its admission. We do not understand how, as against appellants, defendant could rebut this charge of collusion by any statement he might make in the petition filed by him against Bachman, and in which appellants were in nowise parties; and especially could this not be done after appellants had attached this property and appellee had filed his claim bond, and the issue of fraud and collusion was thus being litigated. The evidence was clearly inadmissible and will necessitate a reversal of the case. In their second amended tender of issues, appellants alleged that the indebtedness from Bachman to them was evidenced by twelve certain promissory notes for $100 each, in each of which a lien was reserved upon part of the machinery in controversy to secure its payment, and that these notes were merged into a judgment rendered in the suit in which the attachment under which the levy in this case was made was issued; they also alleged the insolvency of Bachman, and prayed that the issue thus raised as to the validity of this lien be litigated in this proceeding and foreclosed, and if the court found it necessary, that Bachman be made a party for this purpose. Appellee filed a special exception to this part of appellants’ issues, to the effect that this alleged lien could not be litigated in this proceeding, and the court sustained this exception; and a majority of the court are of opinion that this was error, believing that under the peculiar facts of this case appellants should have been permitted to foreclose their lien, if valid, on-that portion of the property in controversy upon which it might have been shown to exist. As they had already obtained a judgment against Bachman, who was alleged to be insolvent, for the debt secured by the lien, which judgment they think may be inferred from the pleading to be still in force and not dormant, and as Bachman had conveyed all his interest in the property to Parks, they do not believe it necessary for him to be made a party to the suit for foreclosure; and as the parties, therefore, were all before the court and the property in the custody of the law, under Revised Statutes, article 4823, they do not believe there is any feature in the very speedy and informal method of procedure provided by our statute for forming and trying the issue as to the right of property which would preclude the foreclosure of a lien on the same property in the same suit between substantially the same parties, especially as that statute provides that the practice under it shall be as nearly as practicable the same as in other cases. Rev. Stats., art. 4837. They think that while under the present statute the claimant’s bond secures the cost of the suit, this was not formerly so, and the judgment to be entered for costs on such bond is not peculiar to this remedy. Rev. Stats., art. 4843; 49 Texas, 170; 80 Texas, 233. In their view, while it maybe that it would be simpler and better not to allow the joinder, yet they think that this objection would lie to our whole system, which seeks to settle as far as possible controversies between the same parties in one suit. For an intimation that a joinder in such cases would be proper, see Dupuy v. Ullman, Lewis & Co., 78 Texas, 341. The writer, however, can not agree with this view of the law as being applicable to this proceeding. In their tender of issues, which was filed May 27, 1889, appellants allege that the judgment in their favor against Bachman was rendered on the 7th day of March, 1887, and it will thus be seen that more than two years elapsed between these dates, and there is no allegation that execution had been issued so as to prevent the judgment from being dormant at the date this foreclosure was sought. If this judgment was dormant, it is settled that Bachman would be a necessary party to obtain this foreclosure (Slaughter v. Owens, 60 Texas, 668), and the writer is not prepared to say that he would not be a necessary party even though the judgment be in full force. It would seem, under our statute, that the amount due upon this judgment at the time of foreclosure would have to be ascertained (Revised Statutes, article 1340), and to do this Bachman would at least be a proper party. He should be allowed to show what part, if any, of this judgment had been paid since its rendition. An examination of the different cases in which suits have been brought in this State to foreclose liens after the rendition of judgment for the debt to pay which the lien is foreclosed, seems to disclose the fact that the debtor in the judgment has invariably been made a party to the foreclosure suit; but there are intimations m the opinion delivered in the case in 60 Texas, cited above, which would indicate that this might not be necessary in case the judgment was not dormant. Proceeding, however, upon the idea that appellants’ issues will be so amended as to show that their judgment against Bachman is still in force, and conceding that for this reason it will not be necessary that he be made a party to this proceeding, the writer does not believe that even in such case it would be proper practice to allow the joinder of these two distinct causes of action herein. Ordinarily a lien is foreclosed by filing a petition, which is answered in the usual way, but in this case it is sought to be foreclosed by a tender of issues in a statutory proceeding seemingly authorized for the sole purpose of determining as to whether or not the property levied on is subject to the writ. It must be admitted, however, that our courts have gone to great lengths in the line indicated by the views entertained by the majority of the court, and many causes of action have been permitted tobe joined-that under the practice obtaining in the tribunals of other States would not be allowed; but even in this State the practice is not without its limits, and the writer is aware of no case where a special proceeding, such as this, has been joined with a suit that ordinarily could be prosecuted only under the forms prescribed for cases generally, and he believes that no good purpose can be subserved by attempting to engraft on our already liberal practice an additional feature of this kind. It will be borne in mind that appellants do not claim to have a lien upon all of the property in controversy, but only upon some of the machinery. As a basis for this proceeding appellee was required to give bond for the trial of the right to this property, conditioned as required by our statute; and if he should fail to maintain his claim, his securities would be required to pay the costs of this proceeding. So far, then, as the trial of the question of the liability of this property to appellants’ attachment is involved, the securities on appellee’s claim bond are parties to this proceeding, and liable to have judgment rendered against them, from which they could prosecute an appeal; and the writer believes that this being a statutory proceeding, the liability of these securities should be measured strictly by the terms of their bond, and that they should not be forced into a litigation involving other issues than those properly raised in deciding their liability. If the joinder of this separate and distinct cause of action is to be permitted, and plaintiffs should be successful upon one or both issues, and appellee or his securities desire to appeal from the judgment rendered, would both cases go up on such appeal, or only the one of which they desired to complain ? How would the appeal bond be payable and conditioned ? How would the cost of the two proceedings be adjusted ? If appellants should succeed in holding the property subject both to their attachment and contract liens in the same judgment, and the securities on the claim bond should appeal by giving a supersedeas bond, what would be their liability thereon, in case the judgment should be affirmed, for having thus delayed the foreclosure proceedings ? The securities on the claimant’s bond, it is believed, should not be held responsible for any part of the costs incurred in litigating over the contract lien, and the adjustment of these complicated issues, it seems to the writer, would suggest the better practice to be to keep the suits separate. Certainly this is the view that has heretofore been entertained by the profession. Commencing in 12 Texas, mortgagees out of possession attempted to maintain this statutory proceeding for the trial of the right of property, and since that time numerous cases have arisen in which the plaintiffs therein occupied the same position in reference to the property claimed as appellants in this case, but it seems that none of them understood that they would have the right to foreclose their respective mortgages in case they failed to maintain their right to the property itself. The majority of the court, however, as indicated above, are of the opinion that the rights of the different parties can be sufficiently protected in the judgment that is rendered, and that it will be more in harmony with our system of practice to allow, upon proper pleading, all claims in reference to any of the property in controversy to be settled in this proceeding, without driving the parties to the necessity of instituting a separate suit, and the action of the court below in not permitting this to be done will be held to be error. Some of the more recent cases illustrating the practice in our courts in reference to the joinder and misjoinder of causes of action are as follows: Stewart v. Gordon, 65 Texas, 344; Bank v. Emery, 78 Texas, 498; Callahan v. Houston, 78 Texas, 494; Construction Co. v. Meddlegge, 75 Texas, 634. Delivered December 13, 1892. There are quite a number of other assignments of error, but we believe no useful purpose could be subserved in their discussion, as the questions suggested therein are not likely to arise upon another trial. We will add, however, that the practice of submitting cases upon special issues is not only recognized as being proper by our decisions, but is also left to the discretion of the trial judge by our statute. 1 Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 1333. We will also add, that we are of opinion that if appellants had a contract lien, as alleged, upon a part of the machinery in controversy, this lien was not waived by suing out an attachment upon the debt secured by such lien. We see no such inconsistency in the two suits as that the suing out of the attachment should have this effect. Allyn & Co. v. Willis & Bro., 65 Texas, 72; Byram v. Stout, 127 Ind., 195. Since Mc-Alpin v. Burnett, 19 Texas, 497, it has been repeatedly held in this State, that suing upon a note secured by a lien without having the lien foreclosed is not a waiver of such lien. Slaughter v. Owens, 60 Texas, 668. The authorities referred to in Jones on Chattel Mortgages, section 565, intimating a different view, are reviewed in Byram v. Stout, 127 Indiana, above cited. In this State a mortgage only has the effect of a lien on the property, as in Indiana. For the errors above indicated, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","W. C. Howard & Co. v. O. F. Parks. No. 44. 1. Evidence — Intent to Defraud Creditors. — On a trial of the right of property levied on by attaching creditors of A., and claimed by P., his vendee, the claimant can not, for the purpose of disproving fraud and collusion in the transfer of the property to himself, and of showing a consideration therefor, give in evidence his petition (and the allegations therein) filed in a suit instituted by himself against A. after the levy of the attachment, and to which latter suit the-attaching creditors were not parties. 2. Joinder of Actions and Parties — Trial of the Bight of Property. — Where a lien is reserved in notes given for the purchase of personal property, on which notes a judgment not foreclosing the lien is recovered, and in that suit an attachment is issued and levied on the property covered by the lien, such contract lien may in the statutory action for the trial of the right of property be foreclosed and enforced against a claimant holding the property under transfer from the judgment debtor, and this without making the judgment debtor a party thereto. Justice Head dissenting. 3. Lien — Waiver.—A contract lien is not waived by suing out an attachment on the debt secured by such lien. Appeal from Johnson. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. Tillman Smith, for appellants. 1. The trial court erred in holding that the contract lien of appellants could not be asserted and foreclosed in the trial of the right of property. The court had jurisdiction over the subject matter, and our law abhors a multiplicity of suits. Chambers v. Cannon, 62 Texas, 293; Douglass v. Neil, 37 Texas, 547; Bourke v. Vanderlip, 22 Texas, 224; Smith v. Clopton, 4 Texas, 114; Johnson v. Heidenheimer, 65 Texas, 267; Fitzhugh v. Custer, 4 Texas, 391; Neill v. Keese, 5 Texas, 23. 2. When a note is secured by a mortgage or lien, the same is not lost, waived, or affected by bringing a suit on the note, and not in the suit foreclosing the lien. Cannon v. McDaniel, 46 Texas, 305; Byram v. Stout, 127 Ind., 195. Crane & Ramsey, for appellee. 1. In a suit of trial of right of property under our statute, the sole issue that can be tried as to the plaintiff is, by what authority he had caused the property to be levied on under his writ; and as to the claimant, by what right he resisted the execution of the writ. Wright v. Henderson, 10 Texas, 204; Wright v. Henderson, 12 Texas, 43; Gillian v. Henderson, 12 Texas, 48; Wootton v. Wheeler, 22 Texas, 338; Belt v. Raguet, 27 Texas, 471; Raysor v.

"GARRETT, Presiding Judge, Section B. Plaintiffs brought this suit as the heirs of John D. Womack, Jr., and Archie Womack, to recover of the defendant, E. L. Dohoney, a two-tliirds interest in a tract of 825-J acres of land of the S. M. Fulton survey, in Lamar County. They pleaded their title, deriving it from one W. W. Stell; recognized an interest of one-third of the land in the defendant as the grantee of Mrs. Mollie E. Pass, one of the heirs of John D. Womack, Jr., and Archie Womack; alleged that the deed of conveyance from W. W. Stell to John D. Womack, Sr., had been lost or mislaid; and that the defendant claimed the entire tract under an after deed from Stell, which inured to their benefit as well as his own. The defendant answered, that he had purchased certain portions of the land at tax sales; that he had bought 65 acres from one McCuistion; that he had purchased the entire tract from the said Mollie E. Pass and her husband, and that he had procured a deed therefor from the said W. W. Stell, which conveyed to the defendant a legal and equitable title, because no deed had ever been executed from Stell to the said John D. Womack, Sr. The case was tried without a jury, and resulted in a judgment for the plaintiffs for two-thirds of the land, and a decree of partition. Defendant has appealed, and has assigned errors for which he seeks a reversal of the judgment of the court below. The court’s findings of fact were as follows: “1. That W. W. Stell had a valid title to all the land described in plaintiffs’ petition, and that plaintiffs and defendant claim through him as a common source. “ 2. That W. W. Stell bargained and sold the said- land in 1864 to John D. Womack, Sr., and received the purchase money therefor, and that afterward, about 1867 or 1868, he executed a deed to said Womack for said land, which deed is lost. “ 3. That on April 21, 1868, John D. Womack, Sr., by deed, sold and conveyed said land to Wm. H. Womack. “4. That on the 23d day of February, 1870, Wm. H. Womack, by deed, conveyed said land to John D. Womack, Jr., and Archie Womack. “5. That plaintiffs and Mrs. Mollie E. Pass are the sole surviving heirs of Archie and John D. Womack, Jr., and that as such plaintiffs inherited an undivided two-tliirds interest and Mrs. Mollie E. Pass an undivided one-third interest in and to said land. “ 6. That on the 4th day of December, 1885, Mrs. Mollie E. Pass, joined by her husband, conveyed by deed all her interest in said land to E. L. Dohoney, the defendant. “ 7. That in June, 1887, W. W. Stell executed a quitclaim deed to the defendant, without any consideration except as recited therein, to-wit, the purpose to supply the lost deed from Stell to John D. Womack, Sr., mentioned in No. 2 of the preceding findings.” There is also a statement of facts in the record. W. W. Stell acquired his title to the land by deed from B. F. Mc-Cuistion, as administrator of his wife Mary McCuistion, deceased. This deed was admitted in evidence over the objection of the defendant, without proof of the proceedings in the Probate Court ordering the sale and confirmation thereof. A bill of exceptions was taken and the action of the court assigned as error. The subsequent introduction of the same deed by the defendant was a waiver of the error in its admission in behalf of the plaintiffs. Again, as Stell was common source, it can not be seen how the error was material, if it was error at all. In order to lay the predicate for the introduction of secondary evidence to prove the contents of the alleged lost deed from W. W. Stell to John D. Womack, Sr., witnesses were permitted by the court to testify on the stand as to the execution and loss of such a deed, without a preliminary affidavit. The evidence of a witness on the stand may suffice instead of such affidavit. Parks v. Caudle, 58 Texas, 220; Trimble v. Edwards, 84 Texas, 497. But it is contended that the proof of the execution of the deed is not sufficient to sustain the finding of the court. W. W. Stell, the alleged grantor, testified: “About the year 1864 I sold the land described in plaintiffs’ petition to John D. Womack, Sr. He paid me cash the purchase money, which was about $8000 in Confederate money. I thought until recently that I made him a deed for the land at the time he purchased the same, but recently I have investigated the records, and am now of the opinion that I only then made him.a bond for title, from the fact that McCuistion did not make me a deed until 1867. Until I searched the records I had firmly believed that I had made a deed, and now I have no other reason for believing that the deed was not made than the fact that I failed to find it by such search. I now think that I have made three different deeds to this land. “Sometime between the 1st day of April, 1867, and the 1st day of April, 1868, F. W. Miner, representing the Womack side of the question, approached me about this land and said his client wanted a deed from me. The matter was satisfactorily settled at that time, and I am confir dent that I made Womack a deed for the land then, though I could not swear positively that I did make it. I am perfectly well satisfied now that I first made a title bond to John D. Womack, Sr., and that I again, in 1867 or 1868, made a deed when approached by F. W. Miner. “In June, 1887, the defendant, E. L. Dolioney, informed me that no deed was of record from me to John D. Womack, Sr., stating at the same time that he held a fee simple title from all the heirs of said AVomack; said Dolioney thus induced me to sign him a quitclaim deed to supply this loss or lack of recorded deed from me to John D. Womack, Sr. Defendant knew at the time he received this last mentioned deed from me of the former sale to said Womack, and also of the fact that the purchase money had been paid by said AVomack to me. E. L. Dolioney has never paid me anything for said 8251,- acres of land, nor did he pay me anything for said deed. Womack paid me cash for the land, and I have never claimed the land since I sold to him, nor do I now claim any interest in it. It has been known ever since said sale as the Womack .land, and so recognized by me, and I am perfectly satisfied with said sale now.” The deed from W. W. Stell to E. L. Dohoney recited that, “ for and in consideration of the fact that sometime between April 8, 1867, and April, 1868, for value received, I sold and conveyed the hereinafter described land to John D. Womack, now deceased; and whereas, my deed to said Womack was never recorded and is now lost or mislaid and can not be found; and whereas, E. L. Dohoney is now the owner of said land, by purchase and conveyance from the assignees and surviving heirs of said John D. Womack, deceased; now, therefore, to pass whatever technical or legal title may appear from the record to remain in me to the real and equitable owner, I have granted, sold, and conveyed, and by these presents do grant, bargain, and sell and convey unto the said E. L. Dohoney, and to his heirs and assigns, a certain tract of land,” etc. * * * “ To have and to hold the above described premises, together with all and singular the rights, members, improvements, hereditaments, and appurtenances thereto in any way belonging, unto the said E. L. Dohoney and his heirs and assigns forever, in fee simple; it being understood that this is only a quitclaim deed.” Dohoney was claiming the land by tax deeds, by a deed from McCuistion for 65 acres out of 100 acres sold to J. W. Wooldridge by Archie Womack, Jr., and by a deed from Mrs. M. E. Pass and husband for their right, title, and interest in the land. F. W. Miner testified, that in 1867 Womack told him that he had bought the land from Stell for Confederate money, but had no deed or bond for title, and employed witness to procure a deed. The witness detailed negotiations with Stell about getting a deed, and said that the matter was delayed and deferred and no deed was ever executed by Stell to Womack. Defendant pleaded, that the recital in the deed from Stell to him that a deed had been executed by Stell to Womack and was mislaid or lost was, in fact, untrue, and that the deed from Stell to him invested him with the full legal and equitable title to the land in controversy. The recital in the deed from Stell to Dohoney that a deed had been executed by Stell to Womack was admissible as evidence of that fact. McCutchen v. Purinton, 84 Texas, 603. We think that the finding of the court below that such a deed was executed was supported by the evidence, and that there was sufficient testimony as to its contents. In announcing its conclusions of law it was stated by the court: “ If the court should be mistaken in its findings that W. W. Stell executed a deed to John D. Womack, Sr., in 1867 or 1868, yet the court is of the opinion that the deed executed by W. W. Stell to the defendant in June, 1887, being made for the purpose of carrying out the original contract made by Stell with John D. Womack in 1864, inures to the benefit of plaintiffs as well as to the defendant, and perfects plaintiffs’ title to an undivided two-thirds interest in the land.” The conveyance was made upon a pre-existing consideration for the purpose of vesting the legal title where Stell supposed it equitably belonged; and if, in fact, Stell had not before executed a deed to Womack for the land, then Dohoney, who took the conveyance with full notice of the rights of Womack, and was himself claiming under him, became the trustee by construction of the legal title for the benefit of himself and the plaintiffs. Soye v. McCallister, 18 Texas, 98. It was not necessary that the transaction should be such as to create a resulting trust, as contended by the appellant under his fourth assignment of error, in order to make the deed inure to the benefit of plaintiffs as well as Dohoney, because a conveyance may be made under such circumstance as would imply a constructive trust; and we think that the circumstances in this case are such as would make it inequitable for the defendant to hold the entire title against the just claim of the plaintiffs, of whose rights he had full notice outside of the recitals in the deed from Stell to him, because he knew that there were in fact other heirs besides Mrs. Pass, who conveyed to him only what interest she had in the land, and procured the deed by representing to Stell that he owned the title of the heirs. No objection was made to the deed in the court below, that there was not a sufficient consideration shown to support its execution. It has, however, been frequently held that Confederate money was a valuable consideration; and if the land was paid for in 1864 with Confederate money, that would be a sufficient consideration for the execution of the deed after that character of money had become entirely worthless. There is an assignment of error that the court erred in admitting in evidence the deed of partition by a portion of the heirs of John D. Womack. Whether or not there was error in this matter is immaterial, because title was shown in the heirs without reference to that instrument. Appellant’s seventh assignment of error relates to the exclusion from the evidence of the deed from Archie Womack to J. W. Wooldridge for 100 acres of the land in controversy, to be taken wherever the grantee might select; and a deed from J. W. Wooldridge to M. H. McCuistion for 65 acres of the 100 acres, and a similar deed from McCuistion to the appellant for the 65 acres. It was error to exclude the Wooldridge deed, because a deed for a given number of acres to be selected from a larger tract is not void for uncertainty. Nye v. Moody, 70 Texas, 434. We do not pass on the admissibility of the other two deeds, as not necessary to a disposition of the case, and the party to be affected by' them is not before the court. As this error will lead to a reversal of the case, it is proper to note that the owner of the remaining 35 acres of the 100 acres will probably be a necessary party to the suit. The fact that the track of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railway Company ran across the land did not make that company a necessary party; and it was not necessary that the defendant should be in possession of the premises to enable the plaintiffs to. maintain a suit against him. For the error above indicated, we conclude that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Adopted May 24, 1892.","E. L. Dohoney v. W. O. Womack et al. No. 10. 1. Common Source of Title — Proof of Deed Constituting. — Where plaintiff gave in evidence, over objection, an administrator’s deed, without proof of any order of sale or confirmation thereof, defendant's objections on this ground are waived when he subsequently offers the same deed as part of his own title; and such deed being a common source of title, the action of the court in first admitting it, if error at all, is immaterial. 2. Lost Deed — Written Affidavit as Predicate. — The evidence of a witness on the stand as to the execution and loss of a deed may suffice in lieu of a written affidavit as a predicate for secondary evidence to prove the contents of such deed. 3. Lost Deed, Proof of. — See proof held sufficient to establish the loss and contents of a deed. The recitals in a second deed made to supply the lost deed, of the execution of such prior deed, is admissible as evidence of that fact. . .4. Constructive Trust-Deed of Confirmation. — A quitclaim deed of confirmation was made to B. in consideration of a former sale to A., in order to supply a deed supposed to have been then executed to A., and upon the assurance that B. was the vendee of all of A.’s rights. Held, that whether the supposed prior deed had been executed in fact or not, the second deed conveyed the title; and as B. was in truth the vendee of only part of A.'s right, he held the remainder of the title in trust for the real owners. 5. Consideration of Deed — Confederate Money. — Where a sale was made in 1864 for Confederate money then paid to the grantor, this was a sufficient consideration to support the deed made by him to carry out such sale, although such deed was not executed until after such money had become wholly worthless. 6. Description in Deed — Undivided Interest. — Where a tenant in common makes a deed for a specified number of acres, to be selected by the grantee from the whole tract, such deed is not void for uncertainty. 7. Parties to Suit — Eight of Way. — In a suit of trespass to try title and for partition of a tract of laud through which a railway has been constructed, the railway company is not a necessary party. ON REHEARING. 8. Deed by Tenant in Common of a Specific Part. — A deed by one tenant in common for a number of acres (not exceeding his interest) to be selected by the vendee out of a larger tract, is not void, and upon waiver of right toi select, the vendee becomes tenant in common in the entire tract. His share will be represented by a fraction whose numerator is the number of acres conveyed to him, and whose denominator the number of acres in the whole tract. 9.

The grantee in deed takes title with full notice of all facts recited in said deed, and is afterward precluded from denying that such recitations are facts. Such recitations are admissible as evidence of the facts recited. Hardy v. De Leon, 5 Texas, 244; McCutchen v. Purinton, 84 Texas, 603; Polk v. Chaison, 72 Texas, 502. 3. In determining who the real grantee is, in a deed for land, the intention, as shown by the recitations in deed, must be looked to in preference to express names. Soye v. McCallister, 18 Texas, 80. 4. An instrument which describes the land attempted to be conveyed as 100 acres in S. M. Fulton survey, Lamar County, Texas, to be taken in any part of an 825 acres tract that the grantee might select, is void as a deed for want of sufficient description, and conveys (if anything) no legal title, but only an equitable right to make a selection, which right could be barred in ten years under a plea of stale demand. Dull v. Blum, 68 Texas, 299; Montgomery v. Noyes, 73 Texas, 208; Gresham v. Chambers, 80 Texas, 548; Flanagan v. Boggess, 46 Texas, 335; Hunter v. Morse, 49 Texas, 235; Jones v.

"KEY, Associate Justice. This is an action of trespass to try title, commenced May 14, 1885, by Priscilla Calvert, Mattie Shelby, Alfred Shelby, and Mary Watkins, against Victor Beze, John Twohig, Angel Martinez, and Benito Lopez. The plaintiffs’ petition described the land sued for as follows: “Two thousand acres of land in Wilson County, Texas, bounded and described as follows, to-wit: Beginning at the lower corner of the Arocha eight leagues grant, at the mouth of the Pajaritos Creek; thence up said creek with its meanders, and with the southeast boundary line of said survey, 2200 varas to a stake set on said line for the northwest corner of- Hernandez survey; thence with the back line of Hernandez survey south 61° east 2460 varas to a stake; thence south 50° west 4850 varas to the San Antonio River; thence up said river with its meanders to the beginning.” The defendants Lopez and Beze filed pleas of not guilty and five and ten years statutes of limitations. Defendant Martinez disclaimed, and before trial plaintiffs dismissed as to defendant Twohig. Mary 1ST. Cortez, Rusu de Cortez, Jennie Davis Cortez, Amelia Laplace, Josephine Summars, Alice Laplace, Clemente (Jortez, John Carr, Emma Carr, Clara Carr, Maria Carr, and Maud Evite Kunneman intervened, and claimed the land as the heirs of Juan Cortez. October 12, 1888, J. B. Dibrell, administrator of the estate of the plaintiff Priscilla Calvert, made himself a party plaintiff. December 3, 1889, plaintiffs and intervenors dismissed as to defendant Lopez. The cause was tried, and upon a verdict of a jury to that effect, judgment was rendered for plaintiffs for the land, and for defendant Victor Beze for $300, the value of his improvements. The latter and the intervenors have prosecuted appeals. The briefs of appellant and intervenors present a number of questions; but we decide the case on one point only. The deed executed by J. C. Morgan, as deputy sheriff of Bexar County, to Thomas M. Dennis, dated October 2, 1839, constitutes a link in the chain of title upon which the plaintiffs and the intervenors rest their claims to the land involved. The introduction of this deed in evidence was objected to by appellant Victor Beze, because of its failure to describe the land in controversy. Error is assigned upon the action of the court in overruling this objection. The deed describes the land which it purports to convey as follows: 6 £All the right, title, and claims of the said Mariano Rodiguez in and to the aforesaid interest in the old Hernandez tract, the said interest being one-half of that part and portion of the said tract which was transferred to the Manchacas; the said part and portion being on the east bank of the San Antonio River, below and adjoining the lands of the Arochas, commencing at Pajaritos Creek and running down, and known as the Manchaca tract, the interest and half of the same above sold and herein conveyed being the upper half.” The only preceding references in this instrument to the land it purports to convey are contained in the following extracts therefrom: “Which said execution was by the said J. C. Morgan, deputy sheriff as aforesaid, levied upon divers real properties (therebeing no goods or chattels found), to-wit: *' * * and an interest in a tract of land known as the old Hernandez tract on the San Antonio River,” and, “I, the aforesaid deputy sheriff and party of the first part in this indenture, did on the specified day offer the same, to-wit, the aforesaid interest in the Hernandez tract, for sale.” The rule is well settled, that less indulgence will be shown in favor of descriptions of property contained in deeds based on compulsory sales under judicial process than applies to descriptions given in deeds and other instruments voluntarily executed by the owner of the property. And in the former class of cases, if there is a patent ambiguity in the description of the land, it can not be aided by paroi evidence, and the deed is void. Wofford v. McKinna, 23 Texas, 36; Norris v. Hunt, 51 Texas, 615; Mitchell v. Ireland, 54 Texas, 301; Wooters v. Arledge, 54 Texas, 395. In our opinion, the description contained in the deed under consideration involves more than one patent ambiguity, which, considered in the aggregate, render it void for uncertainty. For instance, it does not name the county, state, or other political division wherein the land is situated; it does not give the name of the original survey of which the land conveyed is a part, but merely calls it “ the old Hernandez tract;” it describes the land conveyed as “ one half ” of the portion of said Hernandez tract transferred to the Manchacas, without disclosing whether the “ one half” so conveyed isa segregated moiety of, cran undivided interest in, the whole of the Manchaca tract; it calls it one half the portion which was transferred to the Manchacas, but fails to show when or by whom it was transferred, and to how many and which of the Manchacas the transfer was made, and the quantity of land so transferred to them; and gives no other means of identifying the Manchaca land than the statement that it is on the east bank of the San Antonio River, below and adjoining the lands of the Arochas, commencing at Pajaritos Creek and running down, and known as the Manchaca tract. And the final clause, “ the interest and half of the same above sold and herein conveyed, being the upper half,” is equally as uncertain. If “ the interest” constitutes the upper half, it is difficult to perceive how ‘' half of the same ’ ’ can also be the upper half. And the word “upper” may mean up the river, up the creek, or the natural ascent of the land. The plaintiffs and intervenors having failed to show any title in either of them to the land in controversy, and for which they are suing, the judgment of the District Court will be reversed, and judgment here rendered, that they take nothing by their suit and pay all costs of both courts. Reversed and rendered. Delivered January 11, 1893.","Victor Beze v. Priscilla Calvert No. 32. 1. Ambiguities—Defective Description.—The rule is well settled that less indulgence will be shown in favor of descriptions in deeds based on compulsory sales, than applies to descriptions in deeds voluntarily executed by the owner. In compulsory sales under judicial process, if there is a patent ambiguity in the description of the land sold, it can not be aided by paroi evidence, and the deed is void. 2. Defective Description.—In a sheriff's deed was the following description: “All the right, title, and claims of the said Mariana Rodriguez, in and to the aforesaid interest in the old Hernandez tract, the said interest being one-half of that part and portion of the said tract which was transferred to the Manehacas. The said part and portion being on the east bank of the San Antonio River, below and adjoining the lands of the Arochas. Commencing at Pajaritos Creek and running down, and known as the Manohaca tract, the interest and half of the same above sold and herein conveyed being the upper half.” Preceding this is a recital of a levy upon “an interest in a tract of land known as the old Hernandez tract, on the San Antonio River.” This description is so ambiguous on its face as to render the deed attempting to convey land so described void. Appeal from Wilson. Tried below before Hon. Geo. McCormick. This suit was instituted by Priscilla Calvert et al. against Victor Beze •et al. as an ordinary suit of trespass to try title to 2000 acres of land, situated in Wilson County, Texas. This suit was filed May 14, 1885. On April 24, 1888, the heirs of John Cortez, appellants, intervened in the suit, claiming the land in controversy by right of inheritance from their said ancestor. There was a trial by jury and verdict and judgment for the land in favor of plaintiffs. The defendant and the intervenors appealed. The following statement accompanied the opinion. 1. Plaintiffs and intervenors put in evidence a certified copy of a judgment of the District Court of Bexar County, Republic of Texas, in -favor of John Cortez and against Mariano Rodriguez, for $2653.54, dated April 18, 1839. 2. Outside of the recitals in the sheriff’s deed referred to in the succeeding finding, there is no proof of the issuance of the execution on the aforesaid judgment recited in said deed. It was shown that the files and records of the district clerk’s office of said Bexar County had been examined, and no such execution could be found. 3. Plaintiffs and intervenors introduced in evidence an instrument in writing, in the form of a sheriff’s deed, executed by J. C. Morgan, as deputy sheriff of said Bexar County, to Thomas M. Dennis, dated October 2, 1839. This deed discloses the name of the sheriff, and that Morgan was his deputy; recites the issuance of an execution on the aforesaid judgment on May 10, 1839, and a levy of same on and sale of the land herein after described and purported to be conveyed. The description in this deed of the land it purports to convey is as follows: “All the right, title, and claims of the said Mariano Rodriguez in and to the aforesaid interest in the old Hernandez tract, the said interest being one-half of that part and portion of the said tract which was transferred to the Manehaeas, the said part and portion being on the east bank of the San Antonio River, below and adjoining the lands of the Arochas. Commencing at Pajaritos Creek and running down and known as the Manchaca tract, the interest and half of the same above sold and herein conveyed being the upper half.” The only preceding recitals in this deed to the land sold are as follows: “ Which said execution was by the said J. C. Morgan, deputy sheriff as aforesaid, levied upon divers real properties (there being no goods or chattels to be found), to-wit: * * * and an interest in a tract of land known as the old Hernandez tract, on the San Antonio River;” and, “ I, the aforesaid deputy sheriff and party of the first part in this indenture, did on the specified day offer the same, to-wit, the aforesaid interest in the Hernandez tract, for sale,” etc. This instrument was acknowledged before John S. Simpson, deputy clerk of Bexar County, without disclosing the name of his principal. 4. This instrument, so introduced, is a certified copy from the general records of Bexar County, certified to by the county clerk of said county. Plaintiffs and intervenors put in evidence a certified copy of a power of attorney from Thomas M. Dennis to Joshua Threadgill, dated March 5, 1841, authorizing him to sell the land conveyed to him by the aforesaid sheriff’s deed. 5. Plaintiffs and intervenors put in evidence a certified copy of a deed executed by Joshua Threadgill, as agent of Thomas M. Dennis, conveying what the deed states to be the same land, but which is further described as follows: “The upper and undivided half of said tract of land as herein described, commencing at the northwest corner of said tract on the bank of said river, running down stream for one equal half of said tract; thence east in a parallel line with the northern line of said tract to the eastern line; thence north with the eastern line to the northeast corner of said tract; thence with the northern line to the place of beginning,” to John Laplace as syndic of the estate of Juan Cortez. This deed was in trust for the benefit of Juan Cortez estate. This deed has no date) but was acknowledged and filed for record May 12, 1841. 6. Plaintiffs read in evidence a copy from the records of NatchitochesParish, State of Louisiana, of a power of attorney from John Laplace to John Lawrence Generes, which is as follows: “ Before me, Charles E. Greneaux, parish judge and ex officio notary public in and for the parish of Natchitoches, State of Louisiana, and in presence of the undersigned witnesses, personally came and appeared John Laplace, of the same parish, -who declared that in his capacity of syndic of the creditors of John Cortez, late of this parish, deceased, he does by these presents nominate, constitute, and appoint John Lawrence Generes, of San Antonio, county of Bexar, in the Republic of Texas, to be his true and lawful attorney in fact, giving unto him full power and authority for him and in his name as syndic as aforesaid, to ask, demand, sue for, and by all lawful ways' and means recover and receive of and from all and every person or persons whomsoever all and every sum or sums of money due, owing, or coming to the estate of the said John Cortez in the said Republic of Texas, and all and every species of property, whether real or personal, rights or credits belonging to or claimed by the said estate; give all necessary receipts and discharges; compound, compromise, and arbitrate; appear before any court or courts of law or equity; plead, answer, and reply, obtain judgments, cause the same to be executed, and enter satisfaction tor the same; apply for and obtain for the purposes aforesaid all necessary orders and decrees of courts to receive property in payment of debts due the said estate, and sell, convey, and dispose of the same for the best interest of the said estate and upon such terms and conditions as he may think proper; appoint one or more attorneys under him with the like or more limited powers, and the same at pleasure to revoke; and generally to represent and act for the said John Laplace in his aforesaid capacity in all matters and things generally in which the estate of the said John Cortez may be concerned in the Republic of Texas, to all intents and purposes as though he were personally present; hereby ratifying and confirming all that his said attorney in fact may lawfully do or cause to be done in the premises by virtue of these presents. “ In testimony whereof, the said John Laplace has signed these presents in presence of me, said judge and notary, and of the undersigned witnesses, at my office, in the town and parish of Natchitoches, this thirteenth day of April in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-one. [Signed] “ John Laplace, “ Syndic of the creditors of John Cortez, deceased. 4‘Attest: “ J. Rouginer, “ W. P. Morrow. “ C. E. Grenearx, “ Parish Judge and ex officio Notary Public.” 7. Plaintiffs read in evidence a certified copy of a deed executed by said John Lawrence Generes as attorney in fact of John Laplace to John C. Hays, dated January 20, 1842, conveying land described as follows: “ Two thousand acres of land situated in the county of San Antonio, upon the northeast side of the San Antonio River, and bounded as follows, viz.: Beginning at a stake set for the lower corner of a survey of eight leagues of land known as the Arocha tract, at the mouth of the Pajaritos Creek; thence up the creek with its meanders and with the southeast boundary line of said survey, 2200 varas in a direct line, to a stake set on the said boundary line for the northwest corner of the Hernandez tract; thence with the back line of the said Hernandez tract south 61|-° east 2460 varas to a stake; thence south 50° west 4850 varas to the San Antonio River; thence up the said river with its meanders to the place of beginning, the said lines extending to include 2000 acres.” 8. Plaintiffs read in evidence a deed from John C. Hays to John Twohig, dated June 10, 1870, duly acknowledged on June 10,1870, and recorded in the records of Bexar County, Texas, on June 14, 1870, in Book volume number 1, on pages 465 and 466, conveying to John Twohig, in trust for the special benefit of Mrs. Priscilla Calvert, Mrs. Mattie Shelby, and Mrs. Mary Watkins, among other property, the following land, to-wit: “A tract of 2000 acres on the left bank of the San Antonio River, below and adjoining the Pajaritos Creek, which is part of the lower southeast boundary of the Arocha eight leagues grant, said tract being conveyed to Hays by J. L. Generes, attorney in fact for John Laplace, on January 9, 1842, recorded in Book G, number 1, on pages 554-5.” 9. Intervenors proved the following facts: Juan Cortez lived principally in Natchitoches, Louisiana, and died in the city of New Orleans-in 1829. He was a merchant, and his business relations extended into-Mexico and Texas. He took droves of horses to San Antonio and Mexico, and traded extensively about San Antonio. He left five children: (1) Marselate, who died in 1852, without issue. (2) John F. Cortez, who-died in Mexico in 1843, leaving one son, Rene Edward Cortez; Rene Edward Cortez married Emma Davis, and died in February, 1879, leaving five children, who now live in Mississippi City, Mississippi, to-wit, Rene de Russey, age 15 years; Maria Neville, age 20 years; Emma Davis, age 17 years; and Marselite, age 9 years. (3) Benjamin Y. Cortez was the third son of Juan Cortez; he married in 1866 and died in 1869, and left one son, Clement Cortez, whose age is now 19 years, and who lives in California with his mother, Caroline Cortez. (4) Josephine Clara Cortez was the fourth child of Juan Cortez; she married John Laplace, who died in 1863; she died in 1872. They left the following children: Benjamin, who died without issue many years since; Amelia Laplace, age 50 years, who lives in Natchitoches, Louisiana; Josephine Laplace, age 44 years; John Laplace, age 38 years—all living in Natchitoches, Louisiana. (5) The fifth child of Juan Cortez was Marie Adele Cortez; she married J. B. Carr, and died in 1848, leaving W. B. Carr and Marie E. O. Carr; Marie E. O. Carr married Dr. Kunneman in 1863 and is now living with her husband in Europe; W. B. Carr married in 1867, and died in 1882, leaving as his heirs John,Carr, age 18; Emma Carr, age 17; Clara Carr, age 12; and Maria L. Carr, age 8 years—all of whom reside in Louisiana with their mother. 10. Defendant read in evidence a special warranty deed from Mariano Rodriguez to Jean Beze, dated March 29, 1856, acknowledged before Sam S. Smith, clerk of the County Court of Bexar County, Texas, on April 23, 1856, and duly recorded, conveying unto said Jean Beze all that tract or parcel of land lying and being in the county of Bexar, about 35 miles below the city of San Antonio, and being more particularly described as follows, to-wit: “ The tract of land herein conveyed, containing the quantity of 1200 acres and being taken from the upper or northwestern portion of that certain tract or parcel of land known and designated on the county map of Bexar County as survey number--, in the name of John Laplace, and being a portion of the original Mancliaca grant in the forks of the San Antonio and San Bartolo or Cíbolo; the said 1200 acres beginning at the southeastern mouth of the Pajaritos Creek; thence up said creek to the back line of said survey; thence southeast, following said creek line to a point from which a line going southwest parallel to above line on the Pajaritos will enclose 1200 acres, the limits to be surveyed.” The warranty clause in said deed being as follows: “I hereby bind myself, my heirs, executors, and administrators, to warrant and defend the title to said premises against all persons lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof through, by, or under me, and no further.” 11. Defendant proved that he is the only heir at law of Jean Beze, deceased. 12. The testimony does not sustain either plea of limitation, but does sustain the verdict for $300, the value of defendant’s improvements. One reason why plea of five years statute of limitation is not sustained is, that it is not shown when the deed under which he claims was recorded. 13. The plaintiffs and defendant introduced in evidence certified copies from the records of the Court of Probate of Natchitoches Parish, State of Louisiana, showing a renunciation, in 1830, by the heirs of Juan Cortez, deceased, of their interests in his estate. 14. The said certified copies, as well as all other deeds and written instruments referred to or in evidence, are hereby referred to and made part of these findings. 15. If the deed from Morgan, as deputy sheriff, to Thomas M. Dennis conveyed the land sued for, and there was no error committed in admitting testimony, plaintiffs were entitled to recover. Devine & Smith and L. S. Lawhon, for appellant. 1. In deraigning title under a judgment, the party asserting such title must not only produce the judgment, but also a valid execution and levy on the property sued for. Howard v.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. This appeal is prosecuted on an agreed statement under article 1414, Revised Statutes. A copy of the agreement is as follows, viz.: u 1. On November 12, 1890, plaintiff instituted this action in the County Court of Dallas County, Texas, against the defendant, W. W. Walker, for the value of goods, wares, and merchandise, aggregating $646.88, sold defendant by plaintiff at various times during the year 1890. “ 2. March 14, 1891, plaintiff filed a first amended original petition, from which it appears, and wherein it is alleged, that at the time of the sale of said goods, wares, and merchandise plaintiff was a corporation, incorporated under the laws of the State of Massachusetts, and as such was engaged in Taunton, in said State, in the wholesale and retail mercantile business; that while so engaged, and in the usual course of its business, it sold in said State to this defendant said goods, wares, and merchandise, without having obtained a permit to do business in Texas. “3. It was not averred in said amended petition that plaintiff had filed with the Secretary of State its articles of incorporation and received a permit to do business in. this State, or otherwise complied with the provisions of an act of the Twenty-first Legislature of the State of Texas, approved April 3,1889, entitled, 6An act to require foreign corporations to file their articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State, and imposing certain conditions upon such corporations transacting business in this State,’ and to repeal an act approved April 2, 1887, entitled, ‘An act to require foreign corporations to file their articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State, and imposing certain conditions on such corporations transacting business in this State, and providing penalties for the same. ’ “4. Defendant pleaded the following special demurrer to'said first amended original answer, viz.: “ ‘ That from said petition it appears, that the plaintiff is a foreign corporation, and the said petition does not show that it has ever filed with the Secretary of State its articles of incorporation and received a permit to do business in this State, as required by law; wherefore this defendant says that said incorporation ought not to maintain a suit in the courts of this State.’ “ This demurrer was by the court sustained, and plaintiff declining to amend, the cause was by the court dismissed. “ 5. The ruling of the court in sustaining the demurrer presents the only issue involved in this appeal; plaintiff contends: “(1) That the act above referred to had no application to a foreign corporation whose business was transacted outside of the State, and which had never entered the State nor transacted or carried on business within the State. “(2) That the act is a violation of the Constitution of the United States which gives to Congress the power ‘ to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States and with the Indian tribes.’ ‘ ‘ If either of the above propositions should be determined in favor of plaintiff, the cause should be reversed and remanded; otherwise it should be affirmed.” So much of the act above referred to as bears upon the issues involved is here copied, viz.: “ Section 1. That hereafter any corporation for pecuniary profit (except as herein after provided), organized or created under the laws of any other State, or of any Territory of the United States, or any municipality of such State or Territory, or of any foreign government, sovereignty, or municipality, desiring to transact business in this State, or solicit business in this State, or establish a general or special office in this State, shall be and the same is hereby required to file with the Secretary of State a duly certified copy of its articles of incorporation, and thereupon the Secretary of State shall issue to such corporation a permit to transact business in this State. If such corporation is created for more than one purpose the permit may be limited to one or more purposes. “ Sec. 3. That hereafter no such corporation can maintain any suit or action, .either legal or equitable, in any of the courts of this State upon any demand, whether arising out of contract or tort, unless at the time such contract was made or tort committed the corporation had filed its articles of incorporation under the provisions of this act in the office of the Secretary of State, for the purpose of procuring its permit. “ Sec. 5. Such corporation shall, if its capital stock be one hundred thousand dollars or less, pay a fee of twenty-five dollars to procure such permit; if its capital stock be more than one hundred thousand dollars, and less than five hundred thousand dollars,, it shall pay a fee of fifty dollars; if its capital stock be five hundred thousand dollars, and less than one million dollars, it shall pay a fee of one hundred dollars; if its capital stock shall exceed one million dollars, it shall pay a fee of two hundred dollars.” In the case of Bateman & Bro. v. The Western Star Milling Company, decided by us at a former day of this term (1 Texas Civil Appeals. 90), this act received careful consideration, and we there held, that in so far as it applies to goods sold in one State to be carried into another, it is in violation of the “ commerce clause ” of the Constitution of the United States, and can furnish no defense to a suit brought for the purchase price. It does not appear from the agreement in this case, however, that this was an interstate transaction. It seems the goods were sold by appellant to appellee at its place of business in the State of Massachusetts, and it is not stated that it was in the contemplation of the parties that they were to be shipped from that State into this. That the act does not apply to a transaction of this kind, we think there can be no question. It is neither “transacting business in this State,” nor “soliciting business in this State,” nor “ establishing a general or special office in this State;” and it must be one or the other to come within the purview of the statute. We are therefore of opinion that the judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 3, 1893.","Reed & Barton v. W. W. Walker. No. 793. 1. Interstate Commerce — Foreign Corporation. — The act of the Legislature of Texas, approved April 3,1889, requiring foreign corporations to file their articles in Texas and obtain a permit to do business in the State, in so far as it applies to goods sold in one State to be carried into another, is in violation of the “ commerce clause” of the Constitution of the United States, and can furnish no defense to a suit brought for the purchase price. 2. Same —Statute not Applicable to Case as Stated.—But where a corporation domiciled in another State sells goods there, and it is not shown that they were intended to be shipped into Texas, or that such corporation transacted or solicited business in Texas, or had a general or special office here, the case is one to which the áct does not apply, as the matter is not shown to be an interstate transaction. Appeal from Dallas. Tried below before Hon. E. Gr. Bower. Word & Reeves, for appellants. 1. The power vested in Congress to regulate commerce among the States embraces the instrumentalities by which such commerce is carried on. The power is general, and includes commerce carried on by corporations. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall., 168; Cooper Mfg. Co. v. Ferguson, 113 U. S., 728; Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, 114 U. S., 196. 2. The sale by appellants, Reed & Barton, in the State of Massachusetts, to appellee, of the goods, wares, and merchandise for the price of which this suit is brought, was interstate commerce. Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, 114 U. S., 196; Bowman v. Railway, 125 U. S., 487; Robbins v. Shelby Tax. Dist., 120 U. S., 498; Mobile v. Kimball, 102 U. S., 691; Asher v. Texas, 128 U. S., 129. 3. Section 1 of the act requires the corporation to file with the Secretory of State a duly certified copy of its articles of incorporation, and to pay the tax provided for in section 5. The State has no right to impose a burden or tax of any kind on interstate commerce. Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S., 281; Robbins v. Shelby Tax. Dist., 120 U. S., 497; Asher v. Texas, 128 U. S., 129; Leloup v. Mobile, 127 U.S., 647; Tel. Co. v. Texas, 105 U. S., 460. Crawford & Crawford, for appellee. That Congress has the exclusive power to regulate commerce between the States is not denied, but we contend that the act in question is not a regulation of interstate commerce. It does not in any manner restrict the right of foreign corporations to vend their wares in this State. The act in no manner affects the contract of sale, but it acts upon the person or individuality of the corporation, and is a limitation upon the rights of the corporation, not to sell, but to sue in our State courts. The Federal courts are open to such ■corporations without reference to the fact that the law has not been complied with. The suit can not be maintained in the State court, not because the ■contract is illegal, but because the Legislature has fixed a disability upon the plaintiff. Peterson v. Bank, 32 N. Y., 1.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. This suit was brought on open account for work done and material furnished by appellant to appellee. The petition set out an itemized account of material furnished by the financial agent of the two penitentiaries owned by the State to the Cherokee Iron Manufacturing Company, a corporation chartered under the laws of Texas, and domiciled in Cherokee County. The account runs from February 16, 1891, to January 13, 1892, and consists of machinery, iron, wood, water pipes, tools, engines, and various other articles manufactured both of wood and metal. The account aggregated the sum of 822,189.60, and showed credits to the amount of 815,134.19. This account was sworn to, and duly filed and recorded in book of mechanics’ liens, in the county clerk’s office of Cherokee County on the 21st day of January, 1892. The petition prayed for judgment for the balance still due on the account, to-wit, the sum of 87055 41, with legal interest. The petition further averred, that the articles named in said account were furnished by the appellant, through its duly and legally authorized agents, to the appellee, under contract with it to furnish material for the erection of the furnace owned and operated by the appellee at New Birmingham, in the said county of Cherokee, and that said articles so furnished were used Tby the appellee in building and operating said furnace. The lot upon which the furnace is situated is fully described in the petition, and prayer is made for decree foreclosing lien upon said lot, its improvements, and fixtures. To this petition the defendant in the court below filed the following demurrers: “ Now comes the defendant in the above entitled and numbered cause, and excepting to the plaintiff’s petition filed herein April 19, 1892, says the same is wholly insufficient in law; a.nd of this prays the judgment of the court. Specially excepting to all that part of said petition which attempts to set up and claim a mechanic’s or material man’s lien on property therein described, defendant says the same is insufficient in the following particulars: “1. It appears from said petition and the exhibit thereto attached, that plaintiff claims said lien under a contract alleged to have been entered into with defendant, but it does not appear therefrom that said contract is not in writing, nor are such facts stated therein as entitle plaintiff to the lien claimed if said contract is not in writing. “2. It appears from said petition and the exhibit thereto attached, that plaintiff claims said lien under a contract alleged to have been entered into with defendant, but it does not appear therefrom that such contract is in writing, and if it is, that the requirements of the law necessary to fix such lien thereunder have been complied with. Of this the defendant prays the judgment of the court.” The demurrers were sustained, and plaintiff excepted. The defendant admitted an indebtedness of $5327.69, which was accepted as correct by plaintiff, and judgment was rendered for that sum, but without a decree establishing and foreclosing a lien upon the property of defendant. A motion for a new trial was made by the plaintiff, which was refused, and the State gave notice of appeal. The law upon which the appellant bases its right to a lien is that contained in section 37 of article 16 of the Constitution of the State, and the act of the Legislature entitled 1 ‘An act to ¿provide for the speedy and efficient enforcement of the liens of mechanics, contractors, subcontractors, builders, laborers, and material men, and to repeal all existing laws and parts of laws in conflict with the provisions of this act,” and approved April 5, 1889. The first section of this act is in these words: “ Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas: That any person or firm, lumber dealer, artisan, laborer, mechanic, or subcontractor who may labor or furnish material, machinery, fixtures, or tools to erect any house or improvement, or to repair any building or improvement whatever, under or by virtue of contract with the owner or his agent, trustee, contractor, or contractors, upon complying with the provisions of this act shall have a lien upon such house, building, fixtures, or improvements, and shall also have a lien on the lot or lots of land necessarily connected therewith, to secure payment for labor done, lumber, material, machinery, or fixtures and tools furnished for- construction or repair.” The second section of the act requires that any original contractor desiring to avail himself of its benefits, shall file within four months after the indebtedness shall have accrued his contract in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the property on which a lien is sought to be established is situate, and cause the same to be recorded in a book to be kept by the clerk for that purpose. This section requires this to be done by a journeyman, day-laborer, or other person seeking to establish a lien, within thirty days after the accrual of his indebtedness, with the proviso, that if such journeyman, day-laborer, or other person have no written contract, it shall be sufficient for him to file an itemized account of his claim, supported by affidavit, showing that the account is just and correct, and that all just and lawful offsets, payments, and credits known to affiant have been allowed. Section 4 of the act is as follows: “ If there be no written contract, it shall be the duty of the person seeking to obtain the benefits of this act to deliver to the clerk of the County Court a sworn account as provided for in sections 2 and 3, to be filed and recorded as therein provided; and in such case, when the labor is performed for or the material is furnished to the owner of the building or improvement, the following form may be used, and will be sufficient to fix the lien contemplated by this act: “ The State of Texas,-County.—A. 33., affiant, makes oath and says, that the annexed is a true and correct account of the labor performed (or material furnished) C. D., of - County, Texas, and that the prices thereof as set forth in said account hereto annexed are just and reasonable, and the same is unpaid; that said labor was performed (or material furnished, or both) for said C. D. at the time in said account mentioned, under and by virtue of a contract between affiant and C. D., and that due notice was given by affiant of the labor performed or material furnished, in accordance with section 3; and affiant further makes oath and says, that he is informed and believes that C. D. was at the time said contract was made and entered into and said labor was performed (or material furnished) the owner of the house or improvements described as follows (here describe the house or improvements), and that said house (or improvements) is situated upon a certain lot or tract of land which affiant is informed is owned by C. D., and which is described as follows (here describe the lot or tract of land); and this affiant claims a lien upon said house (or improvements) and upon said land; provided, however, a substantial compliance with the above form shall be deemed sufficient.” There is no appearance for the appellee in this court, and the record does not disclose the grounds upon which the judgment of the court sustaining the demurrers to the petition is based; but we infer that the court held that a material man’s lien could not be enforced by an original contractor unless the contract be in writing. We do not think the sections of the Act of April 5, 1889, which we have quoted above, will admit of this construction. But if the court sustained the demurrers because the petition did not show that the contract between the plaintiff and the appellee was not in writing, we are of the opinion that the petition by its averments, with its exhibit and the attached affidavit, does show that the contract was in paroi and not in writing. We have inspected carefully the pleadings of both the plaintiff and defendant, and we find that the petition avers every fact required by the statute for fixing and establishing a material man’s lien. The Constitution gives the lien, and the office of the statute is simply to prescribe the mode in which such lien is to be fixed and secured. The Constitution makes no distinction between those who contract in writing and those who contract by paroi; and the statute provides for fixing and enforcing liens claimed under either a written or a verbal contract; but it does not require that the contract must be in writing when made between an original contractor and the owner of the property, for furnishing material or labor. The judgment of the lower court is reversed and remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 30, 1893.","The State of Texas v. The Cherokee Manufacturing Company. No. 122. 1. Mechanic’s Lien.—Under the mechanic’s lien law of April 5, 1889, it is not necessary that a contractor who furnishes material to a defendant for the erection of improvements, should have a contract in writing to file and record, to secure and fix the lien. It is sufficient if he file for record a sworn account such as is provided for by the fourth section of said act. 2. Same.—The Constitution makes no distinction between those who contract in writing and those who contract by paroi; and the statute provides for fixing and enforcing liens claimed under either a written or verbal contract; but it does not require that the contract be in writing, when made between an original contractor and the owner of the property, for furnishing materials or labor. Appeal from Cherokee. Tried below before Hon. Geo. F. Ingraham. M. J. Whitman and McClure & Gibson, for appellant. There is no material difference between the Act of 1889 and any previous mechanic’s lien law, unless it be that each succeeding law has enlarged the speedy and efficient enforcement of said liens. Under former acts, when the law was more restricted than now, the courts sustained liens when there was only a verbal contract. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., arts. 3165, 3166, 3967; Gillespie v.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. In the summer of 1886, plaintiff in error, R. A. Black, and one J. D. Cock, entered into a verbal agreement to purchase together a certain tract of land situated in Lamar County. In pursuance of this agreement the deed was taken in the name of Cock, but the purchase was understood to be for their mutual benefit. The purchase price of the land was $300, of which $50 was borrowed on their joint note, and paid as the money of Black. After the execution of the deed to Cock, he borrowed, with the consent of Black, from E. G. Caviness, in the month of September, 1886, $300, secured by a deed of trust on the land, out of which money so borrowed the $50 note was paid off, together with the rest of the purchase money. In December following, the land was conveyed by Cock, without the knowledge or consent of Black, to Caviness, in satisfaction of this $300 loan, then not due. Prior to this, said Cock and Black agreed to sell to E. E. Patterson the tract of land in consideration of his paying the $300 note on the 1st day of January, 1887 (the date of its maturity), and executing his own note for $300 additional, payable one year from that date; out of which transactions Cock seems to have made a profit to the amount of 37-¡- bushels of corn, exacted by him of Patterson as an additional consideration for the sale. Patterson failed to raise the money prior to the conveyance of the land to Caviness, and the latter afterward sold and conveyed the same to the former for the same price and on the same terms as he agreed to do when Cock conveyed to him. The evidence is conflicting as to whether at the date of the conveyanceirom Cock to Caviness the latter had notice of the interest or claim of Black. The court, in the third finding of fact, found that Caviness had no such notice of any interest or claim of Black, and there is evidence to sustain this conclusion. After the $300 note executed by Patterson matured, suit was brought thereon by Caviness to foreclose the vendor’s lien on the land. R. A. Black intervened in this suit, claiming that he had been defrauded, and that he was entitled to half the amount to be collected on said note as against' Caviness, the plainiiff in said suit, and that the same should be paid him on foreclosure of the vendor’s lien, praying in addition for general relief; and failing to recover, he prosecutes this writ of error. The court’s conclusions of fact are all sustained by the statement of facts. Between plaintiff and defendant an agreed judgment was entered, by which plaintiff’s suit was dismissed. Our construction of the transactions disclosed in the foregoing conclusions of fact leads to the following conclusions of law: 1. The conveyance to J. D. Cock made him a trustee for R. A. Black, to the extent of a half-interest in the land in controversy, subject to the encumbrance created by the deed of trust. 2. Inasmuch as Caviness paid no new consideration, but accepted am absolute conveyance from Cock in satisfaction of his pre-existing debt, he was substituted to Cock’s position as trustee for Black, though he accepted said deed without notice of the interest of Black. 3. By the sale and conveyance to Patterson by Caviness, the former succeeded to the position of trustee to the extent of a half-interest in the-land for the benefit of Black, subject to the satisfaction by the latter of his proportionate part of the encumbrance removed from the title by the-payment of the amount originally secured by the deed of trust. These conclusions are supported by the following propositions and authorities: 1. Under the facts found, Cock and his assigns became trustees by construction of law to the extent of Black’s interest in the land; or at least between Cock and Black an express trust was created (which may be shown by paroi in this State). Clark v. Haney, 62 Texas, 511; Hudson v. Wilkinson, 45 Texas, 444; Bailey v. Harris, 19 Texas, 109. •2. A purchaser from a trustee without notice of the trust, where the sole consideration is the payment of a pre-existing debt, takes the property subject to the trust. Everett v. Railway, 67 Texas, 430; 1 Perry on Trusts, secs. 217, 241; McKamey v. Thorp, 61 Texas, 652; Overstreet v. Manning, 67 Texas, 660. In McKamey v. Thorp, above cited, it was decided, in accordance with the great weight of American authority, that a creditor who buys from his debtor, and pays the consideration money by merely crediting the amount upon a pre-existing debt, is not a bona fide purchaser for value. Chief Justice Willie, however, in commenting on the statement in Wallace v. Campbell 54 Texas, 90, that such a purchase might be bona fide when a previous judgment or execution lien had been secured upon the property sold, uses this language: “It may also be remarked, that in such case a purchaser surrenders an existing security, viz., the previous lien of his judgment or execution, and this is held equivalent to the payment of a valuable consideration,” Citing Love v. Taylor, 26 Miss., 574, and Padgett v. Lawrence, 10 Paige Ch., 179. As this remark of the learned chief justice, though in substance repeated in a subsequent part of the opinion, was merely by way of illustration or comment, and not essential to the determination of the question involved in that case, it is not believed to be binding on us as authority, especially after examining the cases cited in its support. The first case cited is from Mississippi, where the general American rule followed in this State, as decided in McKamey v. Thorp, and reaffirmed in Overstreet v. Manning, does not prevail, it having been expressly decided by the Supreme Court of that State, in the subsequent case of Soule v. Shotwell, 52 Mississippi, 236, that the payment and extinguishment of an antecedent debt, in consideration of a simultaneous transfer of property, constituted the vendee a purchaser for value to the same extent as-if he had paid the money; citing the above case of Love v. Taylor, 26 Mississippi, 574. In McKamey v. Thorp, commercial paper taken in due course of trade is recognized as an exception to the general American rule, as is well settled by a long line of decisions in and out of this State, following Swift v. Tyson, 16 Peters, 1-24; and yet the decision in Love v. Taylor was rested upon the ground that no reason was perceived why the rule in regard to negotiable securities was not applicable to the purchase of lands. In the other case cited, the property purchased seems to have been taken in payment and satisfaction of a debt secured by a judgment lien on other property. If the satisfaction of a mortgage on the identical property conveyed to the purchaser, as in this case, should be deemed a new consideration, it would seem that for the same reason the satisfaction of an unsecured debt should have like effect. On this point see West v. Naylor, 93 Indiana, 431, though on the main question the courts of Indiana seem to follow the rule adopted in Mississippi. We can not perceive how an absolute deed to Caviness could place him in a worse position than when he held only a mortgage on the property. If the transaction was not to his disadvantage in its results, we think he should not be permitted to avail himself of the equity of an innocent purchaser to deprive Black of a profit which he otherwise might have made. We are therefore of opinion that if plaintiff in error was willing to accept in satisfaction of his interest in the land one-half the amount of the profit derived by Caviness from the sale to Patterson, as represented in the $300 note of the latter, that defendant in error should not be heard to deny him that relief. Wiseman v. Baylor, 69 Texas, 63. We think plaintiff in error should be permitted to choose between this relief and the assertion of his interest in the land. It follows that the judgment must be reversed, and we think the cause' should be remanded for a new trial, and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 10, 1893.","R. A. Black v. E. G. Caviness and E. E. Patterson. No. 67. 1.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This appeal is from a judgment rendered in the District Court of Cooke County on the 17th day of May, 1889, against appellant, in a suit upon a promissory note. The record presents for determination a single, though somewhat novel, question. On the 26tli day of August, 1887, E. F. Bunch and wife conveyed to appellee W. W. Howeth a certain lot of land situated in the town of Gainesville, Cooke County, for which Howeth executed his negotiable promissory note, to the order of E. F. Bunch, in the sum of $400, payable on or before September 1, 1888; and to secure its payment a vendor’s lien was retained on the land conveyed. Sometime prior to the 7th day of October, 1887, said Bunch proposed to appellant to sell it the note, to which proposition appellant replied that he and the maker of the note must make an affidavit in respect thereto, as required by said company in the purchase of such notes, and furnished Bunch a blank form for that purpose. At the request of Bunch appellant Howeth joined him in making said affidavit, upon being informed by Bunch that he desired to negotiate the note, and that the affidavit was required for that purpose. The affidavit was made, bearing date the 7th day of October, 1887, and began as follows: “ State of Texas, County of CooJee. — I, W. W. Howeth, maker, and E. F. Bunch, payee, do solemnly swear, each for himself, that said payee is the legal owner and holder of a certain vendor’s lien note, dated August 26, 1887, bearing interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, and signed by said maker.” Then follow a great many minute statements with reference to the note and the land which secured its payment, referring to the book and page where the deed was recorded, setting forth the absence of all other liens and the priority of the lien in question, the solvency of the maker, giving a detailed statement of the property owned by him subject to execution, the facts about his homestead, and such like statements bearing upon the validity of the lien as security and upon the solvency of the maker of the note; which statements constituted the bulk of said affidavit. Prior to the making of this affidavit Bunch had sold and did not then own the note which had been executed by Howeth, which facts were concealed by Bunch from both appellant and appellee (the note not being produced at the time of the making of said affidavit). Howeth testified, that he believed at the time that Bunch owned the note executed by him, and had no reason to doubt or suspect that he had already negotiated it; and that he signed the same without hesitation, there being no note exhibited to him, and that the note which he had in his mind and referred to in the statement was the genuine note which he had executed; and that at the maturity of that note, it and the note sued on were presented to him for payment, the one sued on being a forgery and literal copy of the genuine note. He consequently pleaded non est factum to the note sued upon, but paid the genuine note. M. J.. Dart, the manager of appellant company in Texas, testified, that on the 8th of October, 1887, Bunch called a second time at the office of said company in Dallas and offered the note sued on for sale, accompanied by the affidavit above mentioned, and thereupon he bought the note for said company and paid him therefor its face value, and that he was induced to make such purchase on the statements and representations made therein by Howeth, and that he would not have bought the note and parted with the money paid therefor if Howeth had not made said statements; that he relied on the affidavit implicitly and was deceived thereby, and that he knew Howeth to be a truthful and solvent man. He also testified that it was the universal custom of his company to require statements similar to the one given by Bunch from every person offering to sell it vendors’ lien notes. Appellant therefore pleaded an estoppel against Howeth, which was adjudged insufficient by the trial court. It was shown on the trial that Bunch was insolvent and had fled the country, the note being indorsed in blank by him. It also appeared that the statements in the affidavit were all true except the introductory statement quoted above. Among other requisites of an estoppel, it is laid down by Mr. Pomeroy (2 Pomeroy’s Equity, section 805): “ (1) There must be conduct — acts, language, or silence — amounting to a representation or a concealment of material facts. (2) These facts must be known to the party estopped at the time of his said conduct, or at least the circumstances must be such that knowledge of them is necessarily imputed to him. * * * (4) The conduct must be done with the intention, or at least with the expectation, that it will be acted upon by the other party, or under such circumstances that it is both natural and probable that it will be so acted upon.” Delivered November 1, 1892. The fraud perpetrated on appellant was accomplished by means of a forged note. It is true the agent of appellant testified that he was deceived bj' the affidavit,, but in the absence of the forged note there could have been no deception. It was wholly immaterial whether Bunch owned the genuine note at the time or not, as that note was not the one assigned to appellant. He could just as easily have perpetrated the fraud while still owning the genuine note, and negotiated it afterwards. The form of the affidavit furnished by appellant did not direct attention to the question of the genuineness of the note: but the purport of its contents naturally led the mind of the maker of the note to other matters of inquiry. The statement as to the ownership of a certain note described in a certain deed on record was merely an introductory matter to the more important inquiries as to the condition of the title to the property which secured the note, and as to the solvency of the maker of the note. It is clear that the maker of the note was innocent of aiy7 intentional wrong, and that his statement in respect to the ownership of the genuine note was not made under circumstances which required him to know that a forged note was the subject of his affidavit. • The note mentioned in the affidavit was not identified in any way except by description of the genuine note. If appellant desired to guard against forgery, it should have required an affidavit from the maker as to the genuineness of the particular note offered for sale, by having it submitted to the maker and identified by mark or otherwise as the note in reference to which the statements in the affidavit were made. Our conclusion is, that the representation in the affidavit as to the ownership of the genuine note, which was the only false statement therein, was not material under the facts of this case; and that if said representation be deemed an assertion, not only of title to the genuine note, but of its identity with the forged note, which would be material, this fact was unknown to Howeth, and the circumstances were not such as to impute knowledge to him; and that it was not made with the intention or expectation that it would be acted upon in so far as this identity between the genuine and spurious note was asserted, and that under the circumstances it was neither natural nor probable that it would be so acted upon; in other words, that the fraud of Bunch in substituting a forged note, and in using the affidavit as a means of negotiating the forged note, was unforeseen and unexpected, and both unnatural and improbable. We therefore hold that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered. Affirmed.","SECOND DISTRICT, NOVEMBER, 1892. The J. B. Watkins Land and Mortgage Company v. W. W. Howeth et al. No. 12. Estoppel — Forged Note. — II. executed a vendor's lien note to B., who afterward, desiring to negotiate it to a loan company, had H. to join with him in making a lengthy affidavit, in printed form, stating that B. was the owner and holder of the note, describing it; that the title of the land which secured it was good; that it constituted a prior lien on the land; that II., the maker, was solvent, etc. The note was not produced at the time the affidavit was made, and in truth B. had then already sold it, which fact IT. did not know. B. took the affidavit, together with a forged note which was a literal copy of the genuine one described therein, to the loan company, and sold it such forged note.

Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Stuart, Bailey & McCans, for appellant. The court erred in not holding as a matter of law that the written statement made by Howeth and Bunch to plaintiff was such a representation as to the note in controversy as to preclude Howeth from afterward denying that he executed the same. He who makes representation to another that certain material facts are true, knowing that the person to whom he makes such representations relies upon the same and believes them to be true, and intends to act upon them, and has acted to his prejudice, can not be heard afterward to deny the truth of such representations, although the person making them honestly believed them to be true at the time they were made.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. March 13, 1890, appellant instituted this suit in the County Court of Wilson County against appellees. General and special demurrers were addressed to the petition. The court below sustained all of the demurrers, and appellant declining to amend, his action was dismissed. The petition is as follows: “ Your petitioners, A. B. Frank & Co., a firm transacting a commercial business in the city of San Antonio, county of Bexar, State of Texas, and •composed of A. B. Frank, who resides in the county of Bexar, and M. Goldfrank and Simon Lavenberg, who reside in the State of New York, herein after styled plaintiffs, complaining of Karolina O. de Lopez, who resides in the county of Wilson, and of John Kusch and George Schroeder, who reside in the county of Bexar, State aforesaid, and who will herein ■after be styled defendants, shows unto your honor: “ 1. That heretofore, to-wit, on the 9th day of August, 1888, Benito Lopez died in Wilson County, leaving an estate of himself and his wife in said county. “ 2. That the said Karolina O. de Lopez was his lawful wife at the time ■of his death, and after the death of said Benito Lopez made application to the honorable Probate Court of Wilson County to be appointed administratrix of the community estate of herself and her said deceased husband. “3. That subsequently, to-wit, on the 15th day of January, A.

D. 1888, an inventory, appraisement, and list of claims of said estate, which were duly approved by said county judge on the 6th day of October, A. D. 1888, thereby investing said Karolina O. de Lopez with the right to control, manage, and dispose of the community estate of herself and her said husband as she pleased, being responsible on her said bond for any mismanagement of said estate. “ 5. That the said Karolina Lopez had executed another bond, with N. de las Santos as one of the sureties, before the filing of said inventory and appraisement, at whose request, made to the County Court, she was ■compelled to file a new bond, which she did, with the sureties aforesaid. “ 6. That the said Benito Lopez and Karolina O. de Lopez possessed at the time of the death of said Benito Lopez a large amount of community property, which said Karolina Lopez took possession and control of ■as said administratrix upon her qualification as aforesaid. “ 7. That said community estate consisted of personal and real property of great value, to-wit, $13,085.85, and of a large amount of good and collectible claims due said estate, to-wit, of the value of $4719.72, all of which appears by the inventory, appraisement, and list of claims returned into said court and sworn to by said Karolina Lopez and the appraisers of said estate, to-wit, Antonio Flores, N. de la Zerda, and W. A. Scott. “ 8. That the indebtedness of said estate is far less than the assets, to-wit, the sum of $8500. “9. That Benito Lopez was indebted to plaintiffs at the time of his, said Lopez’s, death, as follows, to-wit, on a promissory note signed by said Benito Lopez, payable to A. B. Frank & Co., at their office in San Antonio, Texas, for the sum of 8175.35, dated November 1, 1887, payable ninety days after date, with interest at 12 per cent from date and attorney fee of 10 per cent. That said note was credited with the sum of $100 January 24,1888, leaving a balance due plaintiffs on the 16tli day of October, 1888, of 887.35, which was allowed as a claim against said estate by said Karolina Lopez, and approved by said county judge for said sum of $87.35, and to bear interest at 12 per cent from October 16, 1888. That there is now due and owing on said claim to plaintiffs the sum of $102.20, which said note is filed in the papers of the said estate and is referred to and made a part hereof. Also, said Benito Lopez was indebted to plaintiffs for goods, wares, and merchandise sold and delivered to said Benito Lopez in his lifetime at divers dates on an account, on which there was due on the 21st dajr of August, A. D. 1888, the sum of $394.57. That said account was allowed as a claim against said estate-by said administratrix, and approved by the county judge of Wilson County for the said sum, and there is now due on said account the sum of $447.18. Said original itemized account is filed in the papers of said cause by defendant, and is hereby referred to and made a part hereof. “ 10. That plaintiffs are the owners of said claims, and no part thereof has been paid. “ 11. That more than one year has elapsed since the filing of said inventory, appraisement, and list of claims. “ 12. That said administratrix has failed to faithfully and properly administer said estate, and has wasted and misapplied the assets and property of said estate; has sold valuable real estate at far less than its value, and has failed to diligently collect the claims due said estate, and has not paid any of the debts of said estate, and has squandered and misapplied the assets of said estate, sufficient in amount to pay plaintiffs’ and all other claims against said estate. And still there is property of said estate liable for plaintiffs’ debts, not disposed of. “ Wherefore plaintiffs bring this suit and pray for citation as the law directs, and on a final hearing for judgment for their said claims, the amounts aforesaid, with interest due thereon, and for such other relief as in law and equity they may be entitled to.” The demurrers are as follows: “ Now come defendants in the above entitled cause, by their attorney, and say, that this court hath no jurisdiction to try this cause, because: “1. Plaintiffs’ petition shows, that previous to the institution of this suit, they instituted in the Probate Court of Wilson County a suit upon the same cause of action against these defendants, and that said suit is still pending. “2. Plaintiffs’ petition shows, that prior to the institution of this suit plaintiffs presented the claims herein sued on to the defendant K. O. de Lopez, as administratrix of the community estate of herself and Benito Lopez, deceased; that said claims were by said administratrix allowed; that said claims were afterward approved by the county judge; and that by virtue of such allowance and approval, said claims were merged into judgment of the said Probate Court of Wilson County against these defendants, and can not now be sued upon, there being no warrant of law for a second suit between the same parties on the same cause of action. “3. Plaintiffs’ petition shows on its face, that all questions sought to be decided in this suit are res ad judicata in a court of competent jurisdiction. “4. That plaintiffs having, as shown by their petition, voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the honorable Probate Court of Wilson County, said court being of competent jurisdiction, can not legally institute another suit between the same parties for the same cause of action in a court of this State of an entirely different jurisdiction, but must seek all their redress in the court first chosen. “ 5. Plaintiffs’ petition shows, that there is an administration of the community estate of K. O. de Lopez and Benito López, deceased, and pending such administration no other court except the Probate Court of the county in which said administration is pending has jurisdiction to render a judgment on claims for money against said estate, in the absence of an allegation by the plaintiffs that said claims have been presented to and rejected by the administratrix, and no such allegation appears. “ Wherefore defendants say, that this court hath no jurisdiction over either persons of defendants or the subject matter of this suit, and they pray judgment of the court dismissing them with their costs. “ Should defendants, however, be held to further answer, then they demur to plaintiffs’ petition, and say the same is not sufficient in law or equity to hold these defendants to answer; and for special exceptions to said petition defendants say: “1. Said petition fails to show that the claims sued on were ever rejected by the defendant K. 0. de Lopez as administratrix. “2. Said petition shows that there is another suit pending in this State between the same parties for the same cause of action. “3. Said petition does not set out the items of the account sued on. “ 4. Said petition does not allege to what class the claims sued on belong. “ 5. Said petition does not allege and show that all claims against said estate entitled by law to priority of payment have been paid, or that there is property of said estate subject to execution sufficient to satisfy not only the claims sued on but as well those entitled to priority of payment. “ 6. There is no allegation in plaintiffs’ petition of any finding by the Probate Court of Wilson County, Texas, of such facts as would authorize this action. “ 7. The allegations of the petition show, that plaintiffs are creditors of the community estate of K. 0. and Benito Lopez, and there is no warrant of law for suit by them against the defendant K. O. de Lopez and her sureties, without first having sought the judgment of the Probate Court as to whether the facts would authorize such suit.” We believe the petition states a cause of action. The petition does not meet the test ordinarily required in stating a cause of action upon a promissory note and open account. It does not allege that Benito Lopez became bound by reason of the execution and delivery of the note; nor does it set out the items constituting the account or give a bill of particulars of the amounts and items, but refers to an account filed in the papers in the case, showing the several items thereof. The same degree of certainty is required in stating a cause of action against appellee as the representative of the Lopez estate, in seeking to establish a debt against it, or in seeking to make appellees liable for the payment of the claim, as would exist in seeking a recovery against Lopez if he was alive and a party to the suit. But the want of allegations in the respects noticed is cured by the averments of the petition which charge that the appellees allowed and approved the claims sued upon. We know of no law that requires the survivor of the community estate when so administered to allow and approve a claim, nor does the law require such action by the county judge as in other administrations, and the effect of the allegations that the claims were allowed by the appellee, the survivor of the community estate, and approved by the county judge, would not have the effect of merging said claims into a judgment, as would be the effect in a regular administration under the statute; but the effect of such allegations would be, if true, that appellee admits liability upon the note and account sued upon. It is similar to a cause of action based upon an account stated. The fact that the amount has been admitted or agreed upon, relieves the plaintiff from the necessity of proving the items constituting the basis of his claim. The petition does not state to what class the plaintiffs’ claim belongs. The law requires that the survivor of the community, when administering the estate, shall pay claims in the order in which they are classed, and a demurrer questions the petition for its failure to so state. This allegation was not required to be made under the facts as pleaded. It appears from the averments that the survivor of the community received assets of the estate largely in excess of the debts of the estate, and that she has misapplied and squandered property of the estate in value much more than all of the debts due by it. The petition seeks to recover of her and her sureties on her bond the amount of debts sued upon; alleging that the waste and misapplication of the property of the estate creates a breach of the bond. The fact that the administratrix has violated the terms of the bond by squandering and wasting property of the estate in value far in excess of all the debts due by it, renders it unnecessary to state to what class the claim belongs, as such facts show the appellees are liable for the claims sued upon as well as all other debts due from the estate. It does not appear from the record what was the principal reason why the court below held the petition defective and why it sustained all of the demurrers; but from the manner in which the case is presented here, we are inclined to believe that the court below sustained the demurrers upon the ground that the County Court had no jurisdiction to render the judgment asked, and that if the plaintiffs had a remedy, it was on the probate side of the docket, as given by articles 2176, 2177, and 2178 of Sayles’ Civil Statutes. The petition charges a devastavit and appropriation of the assets of the estate by the administratrix of the community, and a failure to pay the claims sued upon, and her and sureties’ consequent liability therefor. We are of opinion that these facts authorize a remedy by suit against her and the sureties on her bond in any court that has general jurisdiction of the amount involved in the suit. We do not believe that the remedy provided by article 2176 of Sayles’ Civil Statutes was intended to be exclusive, but was simply intended as a remedy cumulative of others that exist by virtue of the jurisdiction conferred upon the courts. Such is evidently the construction placed upon the law by the case of Huppman v. Schmidt, 65 Texas, 585, although the controversy there was between distributees of the estate and the survivor administering the community estate and his bondsmen. There is nothing in article 2176 that expressly confines the creditor to the remedy there given. It simply provides a method of ascertaining the condition of the estate and if the facts exist that authorize the creditor to sue. The survivor when administering the community estate is free from the control of the Probate Court, and acquires over the property of the estate the same right of management, control, and disposition possessed by a managing partner during the life of the partnership. How the trust shall be administered, the law does not direct. Leatherwood v. Arnold, 66 Texas, 416. The bond required of the survivor administering the estate is for the protection of creditors and others interested in the estate. And when its conditions and terms are violated to the injury of the creditor, he has the right to go into any court that has jurisdiction of the amount, as is provided for other litigants, and determine his rights there, and is entitled to all the rights and privileges granted other litigants. The facts that he has a claim against the estate and that it is unpaid, and that circumstances have arisen that make the survivor of the community and her sureties liable for its payment, are facts that can only properly be adjudicated in a court that has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit; and in ascertaining if these facts are true, it is a valuable privilege that the parties have in having them passed upon by the verdict of a jury. This they can not do if the jurisdiction of the Probate Court is exclusive as given by articles 2176, 2177, and 2178 of Sayles’ Civil Statutes. Without extending the argument further, we hold that the County Court had jurisdiction, and that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer. Judgment reversed and cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 25, 1893.","A. B. Frank & Co. v. K. O. de Lopez et al. No. 65. 1. Administration of Community Property — Suit on Bond.—A creditor may sue upon a claim allowed by the survivor, administering the community, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. Such suit may be maintained upon the bond executed by such survivor. 2. Same—Pleading—Effect of Approval of Claim.—In a suit on the bond of a widow administering the community of herself and deceased husband, for the amount of a promissory note and an open account, both alleged to have been allowed and approved, it is not necessary to allege that the deceased became liable by the execution of the note, or to give the items, etc., of the account. The allowal of the claims by the widow relieves the plaintiff from the necessity of proving the items of the account. 3. Same.—The law does not require the survivor of the community estate to allow claims, nor contemplate their approval by the county judge. Such allowance and approval do not merge such claim into a judgment. 4. Same—Pleading.—In suit upon such allowed claim by a creditor it is not necessary to allege the class of the claim, when the petition alleges assets largely above liabilities, and that they had been squandered by the defendant. 5. Same — Statutes Construed. — There is nothing in article 2176. Revised Statutes, that expressly confines the creditor to the remedy there given. A creditor may sue upon the bond, whenever its terms are broken, to recover his claim, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. Appeal from County Court of Wilson. Tried below before Hon. A.

The principle or doctrine of res adjudicata or pendency of another suit can only be urged in bar, as to the action or judgment of a court having jurisdiction to determine and enforce the rights of parties to the controversy. 4.

The remedy for the creditor provided by articles 2176 to 2180, Revised Statutes, is additional only to the remedy which always existed, and does not by its terms or by implication exclude any other remedy. The appropriation by the administrator of the assets which the law gives the creditor as a fund from which his claims are to be paid, is the foundation of a suit against him; and the District or County or Justice Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter, and suit may be at once brought in said court without first establishing the right to sue in the Probate Court.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Plaintiffs in error brought this suit against defendant in error G. W. Shannon, as sheriff of Eastland County, and the sureties on his official bond, to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by the negligence of said Shannon in taking an insufficient claimant’s bond and delivering to Deland & Redfield, the claimants, a certain stock of merchandise which had been attached by plaintiffs in error as the property of one Caldwell. The defects in the claimant’s bond, as alleged in plaintiffs’ petition, consisted of its being made payable to them jointly, instead of jointly and severally, with the plaintiffs in two other writs of attachment which had been also levied upon the same stock of goods; and also, it was alleged that the only sureties upon said bond were “ Randall & Darling,” which could at most only stand for one name, when the law required two. The propositions presented by plaintiffs in error are so numerous, and present such slight shades of difference in the points sought to be made, that no useful purpose could be subserved in. attempting to treat them consecutively, and we shall therefore content ourselves with stating as concisely as possible our conclusions upon what we conceive to be the controlling points presented by the assignments of error. We are of opinion that the court correctly submitted to the jury the question as to whether or not the claimant’s bond was signed by C. H. Higbee as a surety, in addition to Randall & Darling. The evidence as to whether Higbee’s name appeared upon this bond as a surety at the time it was accepted by the sheriff was conflicting and to a great extent circumstantial, and the question thus presented was peculiarly one for the jury to decide. The court correctly charged the jury as to the legal effect of the bond in case they found that it was signed by two sureties at the time it was accepted by the sheriff. We are also of the opinion that the fact that the bond was made payable to plaintiffs in error jointly with the plaintiffs in the.other writs of attachment, instead of being made payable to them jointly and severally, was not objectionable. This form of bond is now prescribed by our statute (2 Say les’ Civil Statutes, article 4823), but before passage of this statute we think it was practically recognized as being proper by the decisions of our Supreme Court. Elser v. Graber, 69 Texas, 222; Harness Co. v. Schoelkopf, 71 Texas, 418. We are also of opinion that the signature of a partnership as surety on a claimant’s bond for the trial of the right of property should be governed by the principles applicable to such signature to an attachment bond rather than to those applicable to an appeal bond. The reason given for holding an appeal bond invalid in the Supreme Court when signed by a firm as surety instead of by the individual members of the firm, is, that in that court no pleading can be filed showing the names of the members of the firm so that the court, if necessary, could render the proper judgment against them. Frees v. Baker, 6 S. W. Rep., 563. But in Donnelly v. Elser, 69 Texas, 282, these reasons are held not to be applicable to the case of an attachment bond, for the reason that* proper pleadings can be filed in the trial court upon which the judgment can be rendered, and we see no valid reason why this could not .be done upon the trial of the right of property. The question as to whether or not the blanks in the claimant’s bond were properly filled up with the names of the plaintiffs in attachment, etc.,- by authority from the signers of this bond, after it was signed by them, was not requested by plaintiff in error to be submitted to the jury. If the signers of this bond authorized or understood that this was to be done at the time they signed and delivered it to Redfield in its imperfect condition, we think there can be no serious question as to its legality. Drake on Attach., sec. 336. If upon another trial there should be any question as to such authority, it should be submitted to the jury for their decision under appropriate instructions; but if plaintiffs in error desire this done, they must request charges upon the subject, as otherwise the failure on the part of the court would be one of omission and not of commission, and therefore would not constitute reversible error. There can be no question that a claimant’s bond with but one security is not valid as a statutory bond. Our statute expressly requires that “ it shall be signed by two or more good and sufficient sureties.” Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 4823. We also think there can be but little doubt but that such bond in this State would be sustained as a common law obligation. Bank v. Lester, 73 Texas, 542; Jacobs v. Daugherty, 78 Texas, 682. The court in submitting the case to the jury gave them the following charge: “You are further charged that by the term 1 statutory bond’ as used in this charge is meant such a bond as is required by the statute of Texas, and such a one as will enable a claimant of personal property to contest the claim of plaintiffs in the attachment writ in the summary way for the trial of the right of property as provided by our law; and if in the execution and delivery of a bond to the officer who has levied on personal property by a claimant thereto, such a bond is executed and delivered as will create a binding obligation as against the persons signing their names thereto, but at the same time not such a bond as could be denominated a statutory bond, the effect in law of such action, if excepted to, would deprive the claimant of the right in said action to contest the plaintiff’s claim to the property the ownership of which is in controversy, but would not deprive the plaintiffs of their right to judgment against the claimant and surety, if one on the bond. You are further charged that the plaintiffs, even should you find that no other security except Randall & Darling signed said bond, would in the trial of said suit on the right of the ownership of said property have been entitled to a judgment against said Deland & Redfield, and said Randall & Darling; and if therefore you find that the plaintiffs in said suit negligently failed to take judgment against said Randall & Darling in said suit, and that said negligence proximately contributed to the injury sustained by plaintiffs; and if you further find that plaintiffs could with reasonable diligence have secured their said debt by prosecuting said cause to judgment and execution against the said Randall & Darling, or said Deland & Redfield, you will find for defendant.” We think the court erred in this charge in telling the jury that the plaintiffs in the suit for the trial of the right of property had the right to take judgment against the security on the claimant’s bond if there was only one. Plaintiffs could take this summary judgment only upon a statutory bond; but if a recovery should be sought upon such bond as a common law obligation, suit would have to be brought thereon in the regular way. Jacobs v. Daugherty, 78 Texas, and Bank v. Lester, 73 Texas, cited above. We are therefore of the opinion that if the bond in controversy was not good as a statutory bond by reason of having only one surety thereon, the court was in error in submitting to the jury the question of contributory negligence on the part of plaintiffs in error, based upon their failure to make their money out of the security on such obligation. We think it quite too clear for argument that the plaintiff in attachment could not be required to accept a common law obligation in lieu of the statutory bond guaranteed him by the law, and thereby be subjected to the delays and uncertainty attending the prosecution of a suit thereon to its final termination. Such delay might be so great as to result in the entire release of the sheriff and his sureties by limitation. It seems that the writ of attachment levied upon the stock of goods was also levied upon several tracts of land as the property of the defendant in the attachment, and the attachment lien thereon was foreclosed and the land ordered to be sold thereunder, but no steps had ever been taken to make such sales. The evidence also tended to show that this land, if it really belonged to the defendant in the attachment, was of value more than sufficient to pay plaintiff in error’s debt, and the court in its charge to the jury instructed them that, “If you believe from the evidence at the time the defendant G-. W. Shannon in this case turned over to Deland & Redfield the goods as alleged by plaintiffs, even if said Shannon as sheriff took an insufficient bond in the manner complained of by plaintiffs, nevertheless, if you further believe from the evidence that at the same time the plaintiffs had their attachment lien on said goods, that they also had a valid and subsisting lien upon other property of W. T. Caldwell sufficient to make their debt, and by their own neglect failed to make their said debt out of such other property, then and in that event plaintiff would be precluded from claiming anything from these defendants, and if you so believe you will find for them.” We think there was no error in giving this charge. The rifle of liability on the part of an officer in cases like this is tersely stated by Mr. Drake in his work on Attachments, section 309, as follows: “ Where an officer fails to keep attached property to answer the execution, there is no reason why he should be subjected to a different rule of damages from that which prevails in actions generally against officers for neglect or failure of duty; that is, the actual injury sustained by plaintiff by reason of the neglect or failure. The value of the property attached, if less than the amount of the plaintiff’s judgment, or the amount of the latter where the value of the property is greater, will generally be prima facie the measure of damages, subject to be mitigated by evidence produced by the officer.” Also see 2 Sedg. on Dam., secs. 345, 346; Smith v. Tooke, 20 Texas, 750; Walton v. Compton, 28 Texas, 569; De Witt v. Oppenheimer, 51 Texas, 103; Hurlock v. Reinhardt, 41 Texas, 580; Barclay v. Scott, 1 Ct. App. C. C., 110, 111. If the sheriff in this case had levied entirely upon personal property, and had only released a part thereof, we apprehend that it would not be contended that plaintiffs could hold the sheriff liable, without first subjecting such property as was not released to their claim, and could then only hold him liable for such part of his debt as might remain unsatisfied (De Witt v. Oppenheimer, cited above); and we can see no good reason why the same rule should not apply where part of the property levied on was real estate. If, however, upon another trial it should be made to appear that this land did not belong to the defendant in the attachment writ, or that his interest therein was of no value, or was exempt, or for any other reason was not subject to the attachment, the fact that plaintiffs had not sold the same would constitute no defense. At the request of defendants in error the court below instructed the jury, that if the plaintiffs’ cause of action accrued to them more than four years next before the filing of their suit on the 24th day of March, 1886, the same would be barred by the statute of limitations, and they should find for the defendants. The court, however, added to this charge the qualification that the statute of limitations would not begin to run against the plaintiff in favor of the defendants until it was established by the decree of the District Court that the property levied upon was not the property of Deland & Redfield, but was the property of W. P. Caldwell, which latter date is shown by the undisputed evidence to have been June 15, 1885. If the claimant’s bond was only a common law obligation, we are not prepared to say that the statute of limitations did not commence to run until this latter date, but we think that even in such case it would not commence to run until the rendition of judgment in favor of plaintiffs in error against Caldwell for the amount of their debt. Until this latter date the sheriff could not be called upon to deliver the property in satisfaction of such debt. Zurcher v. Krohne, Feiss & Co., 63 Texas, 118; Poland v. Henry and Frazier, 64 Texas, 542; Murf. on Sheriffs, 962a. But this judgment was rendered on the 25th day of March, 1882, and this suit was instituted March 24, 1886, and it will therefore be seen that by the undisputed evidence four years had not elapsed between these dates, and we are therefore of the opinion that the court erred in submitting to the jury the question of limitation at all, although we are not prepared to say that this error, when coupled with the qualification made by the court below, would require a reversal of the case. There being no conflict in the evidence as to the date when the judgment was rendered upon the trial of the right of property, and such a short time having elapsed between such date and the institution of this suit, it would probably be unreasonable to suppose that the jury could have made the mistake of finding for the defendants upon this ground. It is, however, error to charge upon an issue not fairly raised by the evidence, and such error will frequently be sufficient to require a reversal. Railway v. Gilmore, 62 Texas, 391. It will be noted that we have treated the case as though the name of Randall & Darling could, in no event, stand for more than one security. This was the view taken by the court below; and as there are no assignments of error calling the correctness of this in question, we have not deemed it proper to enter upon its investigation. There is some evidence in the record which would tend to show that at the time of the signing of this bond the firm of Randall & Darling had been dissolved, and there are also some intimations in the record that both the former members of this firm were present when the bond was signed. If this be a fact, the question as to whether or not, upon proper pleading, this could have been shown to be the individual act of the members of this firm, so as to constitute two signatures to the bond, is of such importance that we would not undertake its decision without a full presentation of the question. Delivered November 29, 1892. For the error of the court in submitting to the jury the question of contributory negligence alleged to arise from the failure of plaintiffs in error to take judgment in the suit for the trial of the right of property on the claimant’s bond, even though it was only a common law obligation, we think the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded.","S. Jacobs, Bernheim & Co. v. G. W. Shannon et al. No. 42. 1. Claimant’s Bond — To whom Payable. — That a claimant’s bond was made payable to plaintiff in the attachment jointly with the plaintiffs in other writs of attachment then levied by the sheriff on the same property, instead of being made payable to them jointly and severally, held not objectionable, though the bond was taken prior to the present statute which prescribes such form. 2. Same — Partnership as Surety. — The signature of a partnership or firm name as surety on a claimant's bond is valid, though the names of the individual members be not signed. 3. Bond — Filling Blanks After Signing. — If the sureties on the claimant's bond authorized or understood at the time they signed and delivered it that the blanks in the bond were thereafter to be properly filled up with the names of the plaintiffs in the attachment, etc., there can be no serious question of its legality. 4. Claimant’s Bond with one Surety — Common Law Obligation. A claimant’s bond with but one surety is not valid as a statutory bond, but will be sustained as a common law obligation. 5. Same — Right of Attaching Creditor. — As such bond will not authorize a summary judgment under the statute against the one surety, the plaintiff in the attachment may proceed against the sheriff for taking an imperfect statutory bond, without having first sued the parties to the claimant's bond on the common law liability created thereby. 6. Same — Right of Sheriff to have Other Property Exhausted.— Though a sheriff may have taken an insufficient claimant's bond, whereby property attached by plaintiff's is lost to them, yet he is not liable for such loss if plaintiffs then had an attachment lien on other property of their debtor, and through their own negligence failed to realize their debt therefrom. 7. Same — Measure of Damages. — The measure of damages against the officer in such cases is that which prevails in actions generally against officers for neglect or failure of duty; that is, the actual injury sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the neglect or failure. 8. Limitation — Suit Against Sheriff. — A sheriff can not be called on by the plaintiff in attachment to deliver attached property until such plaintiff has obtained judgment against the debtor in attachment, and therefore until such time limitation will not run in the sheriff's favor as against a suit by such plaintiff for damages caused by the sheriff's taking an insufficient claimant's bond, whereby the attached property is lost. Error from Eastland. Tried below before M. A. Spoonts, Esq., Special Judge. F. B. Stanley, for plaintiffs in error. 1. The claimant’s bond is intended to be a substitute security for the property released, and in terms must be such as to enable a court to render judgment against the obligors summarily without other pleading or proof than the bond and the judgment, in trial of the right of property. Rev. Stats., art. 4840; Freiberg v. Elliott, 64 Texas, 367; Mardis v. Johnson, 43 Texas, 225. 2. While in a bond or obligation which requires its breach to be established by suit before a recovery can be had, the signature of a partnership name may be presumed to bind all the members of the firm, this presumption can not be indulged where a summary judgment on the bond is contemplated, but the name of each obligor must distinctly appear, as well as the full extent of his undertaking.

Rep., 563. 3. A signature of a party to a blank form of bond, in which neither the name of the obligee, the amount of the obligation, the purpose nor consideration for which it is executed, nor the proceeding in which it is to be used, is stated, is absolutely void for any purpose, and such signer is not bound by the terms of an undertaking written above the signature without his knowledge. 1 Greenl.

Where several and successive levies are made on same property by different plaintiffs, their liens are several and successive and in no respect joint, and the claimants’ bond should be made payable to them severally and successively, so as to preserve their lien as it was. This bond being-payable to them jointly and not severally, changed their relation, giving them a joint lien or cause of action on the bond, and diminished the value of plaintiff’s security, and compelled them to invoke the equitable power of the court to adjust priorities, thus imposing a burden upon them, and it was not therefore a statutory bond.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This is a suit by the appellant, plaintiff below, for herself, as widow, and the minor children of herself and Frank Rozwadosfskie, for damages against the appellee, defendant below, resulting from the alleged negligent killing of Frank Rozwadosfskie by defendant, by running its freight train over him, at San Marcos, Texas, on the 9th day of December, 1888. The court below instructed the jury to find for the defendant, which they did, and the judgment was so rendered; from which the plaintiff has appealed. The facts of the case are as follows: Deceased was about forty years old, a carpenter by trade, earning about $2.25 per day; a strong, robust man, and in good health. He lived with his family at San Marcos, Texas, about 230 or 265 yards from defendant’s depot. He was working at his trade at Kyle, through which defendant’s railway passed, about eight miles northeast of San Marcos. For several nights prior to the 9th of December, 1888, he was expected home as a passenger on defendant’s train. He sometimes drank to excess after his week’s work, when he was paid off, and his wife was expecting him home in an intoxicated condition. She sent her two boys, Martin and Frank, aged respectively 13 and 10 years, to meet him at the train and to conduct him home in case he was drunk. The boys had frequently met him at the train, and had brought him home, and on one occasion he was drunk, ‘ ‘ not very,” he never having refused to go with them. The night of December 9 was cold, and the two boys were at the depot, in the waiting room, where there was a fire, expecting their father on the train due later in the night. The station agent asked them what they were there for. Frank, the older boy, replied that they were there waiting for their father, who was coming on the train from Kyle. He told them that they had been there two or three nights, waiting for him, and that he had not come, and was not coming, and that if they did not leave the depot, and not come around there any more, he would have them arrested and put in jail. His manner and language were rough, and so frightened them that one of them was crying. They were not misbehaving. One of them had been seen about the depot, swinging on the steps of the cars and jumping off while the cars were in motion. They left, and when they got outside, a policeman told them to run on home and come back when they heard the whistle blow. This was 9 or 10 o’clock p. m. They went home and went to sleep, did not hear the whistle, and were not there when their father arrived on the train, between 10 and 11 o’clock on the same night, the 9th of December, 1888. Deceased boarded the train at Kyle about 10 o’clock that night. Witness Johnson went with him to the depot and carried his baggage and assisted him on the train. He was drunk, but not imbecile. He knew what he was doing and where he was going; gave Johnson 25 cents, the exact amount, to purchase him a ticket to San Marcos. He staggered in walking several times, and would have fallen if Johnson had not assisted him. He had a bottle of whisky. In getting on the train he came near falling, and would have done so if Johnson had not caught him. The conductor was looking at him at the time. The steps from the ground were high, and there was no stool, and he had to catch hold of the step rail and pull himself up. The conductor on the train knew his drunken condition. He was helped on to the first seat after entering the car. When the train arrived at San Marcos, deceased threw his bundle of clothes, or something of the kind, out before him on the platform, and then got out himself and leaned up against the car, when some gentleman took hold of him, pulled him away, and told him to “ look out.” After the train left, he was seen in the depot at the ticket window, talking to Mr. Collins, the agent, about his baggage, and said he would leave it there till morning. Witness Meredith, speaking of this, says further: “I then came out of the depot house and started up to town, and when I was about Prince’s lunch stand, deceased called me, and came up behind me, and we then walked on together up to Brown <fc Lindsay’s livery stable, 200 yards from the depot. Deceased caught hold of Mr. Summerrow, who was with me, and said, ‘ You are not afraid of me, are you ?’ to which Mr. Summerrow replied, ‘No, I am not afraid of you.’ Mr. Summerrow pulled away from him, and we walked on together. Deceased followed us some 10 or 15 steps, and said to us that ‘ we could get all the drink we wanted, that the houses were all open here yet.’ Deceased then turned back toward the depot house, and I and Mr. Summerrow came on up to town. That was the last I saw of the deceased till the 10th of December, 1888. I saw him at his house in San Marcos, dead. He was a stranger to me.” The statements quoted of this witness are true, and are corroborated by Mr. Summerrow, except that he did not hear the conversation with the agent. The depot is 700 or 800 feet from the home of deceased, 100 or 200 feet further than the livery stable near which Meredith last saw him. The platform extends along the track east and west of the depot building; is about 2\ or 3 feet higher than the track, and about 3 feet from the track. Dr. Atkinson was called to deceased after he was hurt, and found him on the west end of the platform, about 70 feet from the depot at San Marcos. He testified, and we so find the facts: “His left arm was mangled, he had three scalp wounds, and his left leg was seriously injured. He died next morning from the injuries. He had been run over by the wheels of the cars, as was evident from the condition of the wounds. When I arrived at the depot the hind wheels of the caboose of the freight train were standing about 35 feet from the body of the deceased. Blood was found on the car next to the tender, but none on the wheels of the engine or tender. There was blood between the rail and the platform. He was strong, robust, and healthy. It was evident that the wheels of one car had run over him. Deceased was evidently under the influence of liquor and had lain down and gone to sleep.” The evidence does not show any further particulars of the manner of the killing. It is contended by appellant, “that the driving of plaintiff’s sons from the depot, and preventing them from meeting their father and conducting him home, was the immediate and proximate cause of his death,” and that therefore defendant would be liable in damages for his death in this suit. This proposition, in our opinion, is not the law of the case. It must be borne in mind that plaintiff can not recover unless the deceased himself could successfully maintain the action if living and suing in his own behalf for the injuries received. Rev. Stats., art. 2090. Plaintiff’s sons had the right to be in the waiting room of defendant’s depot to await the arrival of their father and conduct him home, and the act of the agent in sending them away might be held to be grossly wrong, and had they been injured thereby the company would be liable therefor, if the agent was acting within the scope of his authority. Hamilton v. Railway, 64 Texas, 251. But it would not necessarily follow from this that the company would be liable for the death of their father, whose contributory negligence was the proximate cause of the same. At the time the agent required the boys to leave the depot, he did not know the deceased was drunk and would arrive in that condition, nor did he know that they were sent there to protect him on the way home on account of his expected helplessness from intoxication. He only knew that they were there to meet him. This being so, the wrong was too remote from the injury to create liability. Had he known all the facts, then his act would have included all its reasonable and probable consequences flowing therefrom. He and his principal could be held culpable only for what was known to him, or what he would be presumed to know. 1 Sherm. & Redf. on Neg., secs. 29, 26, 27, 28. Under the circumstances of the ease, we do not think the company owed him any peculiar duty after his arrival at San Marcos. Had he required assistance on account of his helpless condition while the relation of' carrier and passenger existed, the company may have been negligent in refusing it. But he required no assistance at that time. Patt. Ry. Acc. Law, sec. 278. Circumstances would control this liability. He was not discharged at an unusual place, where the company would be bound to protect him further or be held bound for any danger he might voluntarily incur. This case is not at all similar to the one cited by appellant, Railway v. Sullivan, 81 Kentucky, 624, where an inebriated passenger was ejected from the cars, away from any station, in the snow, who, before he could obtain relief, the temperature being ten degrees below zero, had his feet, hands, shoulder, parts of his legs and of one arm frozen. We select this case, cited by appellant, to illustrate the distinction that should be made. The principle governing that class of cases and the one at bar is not the same. The difference is quite apparent. In the case at bar, the passenger reached his destination, voluntarily alighted from the train, as was his duty to do at the end of his journey, at a regular station in a town near his home, made arrangements for his baggage, and left the depot and premises of the defendant, and thereby unquestionably ended all further obligations on the part of the company to him, whether he was sick, intoxicated, or sober. The company certainly, under these circumstances, had discharged all its obligations to him, and owed him no further duty as a passenger. Patt. Ry. Acc. Law, secs. 220, 221. He afterward returned and laid down in such proximity to or upon the track as to endanger his life by moving trains; and, in fact, so lost his life. He could not claim immunity from the rule of contributory negligence because he was then drunk, unless the facts show such negligence or want of care on the part of defendant’s servants as would render the company liable, notwithstanding his own negligence. The fact that he was there drunk and asleep would not justify the defendant’s servants in running the train over him and taking his life. If he was seen by them in time, and they were aware of his danger, and by ordinary care they could have avoided the injury, they were bound to do so; but there is no testimony of this character. Railway v. Evans, 71 Texas, 369; Beach on Con. Neg., 390, 391; Railway v. Sympkins, 54 Texas, 623; Patt. Ry. Acc. Law, secs. 76, 77, 78. There is no such negligence shown on the part of defendant or its servants as will render it liable for the death of the deceased, nor such as would relieve him of the consequences of his own negligence directly contributory thereto. A part of defendant’s answer, read in evidence by plaintiff, is claimed by appellant to show negligence on the part of the company that would entitle her to a recovery. The extract is as follows: “ That the place where he so lay down was darkened by the shadow of said platform, and he was obscured from the view from any one on any part of any approaching train, and could not have been seen by the exercise of the utmost care and caution on the part of the persons in charge of such approaching train.” In this connection, it should be stated that it was also averred and proved, that after the relation of carrier and passenger ceased the deceased left the depot and voluntarily returned and lay down near defendant’s railway track, between the track and the depot platform, and there went to sleep. Delivered November 23, 1892. The portion of the answer read does not disclose actionable negligence on the part of defendant. It is the duty of the company to keep lighted, at proper times, its depot, approaches, and other places connected therewith which are likely to be visited by passengers and persons lawfully on the premises; and a negligent omission of this duty, causing injury, would entitle the injured party, without fault on his part, to damages. Bish. on Non-Cont. Law, sec. 1086. But contributory negligence on the part of the person injured might, as before explained, defeat the right of recovery, as in this case we think it did. There is, however, another ground upon which the averment in defendant’s answer can not be made available in establishing its negligence. It is not shown that lights were needed at the point indicated, for the convenience of any person visiting the depot or for the purpose of moving the trains. It could not be presumed, in the absence of testimony, that a light should be placed so as to discover persons that might be lying in such an unusual place, asleep or drunk. There was no testimony upon the subject, and the allegation does not show the necessity for such a light. Therefore negligence on the part of the company can not be rested upon it. The evidence was very meagre as to how the accident occurred, outside of the fact that the deceased was lying near the track asleep, in a place of great danger; no evidence that the train men or any of the company’s servants saw him, knew or ought to have known that he was there, or that they were guilty of any negligence causing the injury. All that the evidence shows is, that the occurrence was attributable to the negligence of the deceased, without fault on the part of defendant or its employes, and for which it is not liable. In such case it was the duty of the court to, instruct the jury to find for defendant. Railway v. Porter, 73 Texas, 307; Railway v. Dean, 76 Texas, 73. The judgment of the court below should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed.","Pauline Rozwadosfskie v. International & Great Northern Railway Company. No. 38. 1. Proximate Cause — Case in Judgment. — Action by widow for damages for negligently causing the death of her husband. She had sent her two sons to the railway depot to bring their father home, expecting him to arrive as a passenger, intoxicated. The sons were ordered from the depot by the agent in charge. The husband arrived on the train after the boys had left, intoxicated, but knowing what he was doing. He left the train, deposited his baggage, and left the depot. Subsequently he returned, went to sleep upon the track, and was run over by another, a freight train, and killed. In such case it can not be held that the driving of plaintiff’s sons from the depot, preventing them from meeting their father and conducting him home, was the immediate and proximate cause of his death, and that therefore the railway company was liable in damages for his death. 2. Remote Cause. — The wrong in driving the boys from the depot was too remote from the injury to create liability. 3. Duty to Passenger. — When a passenger has safely alighted from a train and left the depot at his destination, the railway company does not owe him any further or peculiar duty from the fact that he may be intoxicated. See facts. 4. Care by Railway Company to Avoid Injury Upon the Track. If a person lying asleep upon a railway track is seen by those managing an approaching train in time, and they are aware of his danger, and by ordinary care they can avoid injury, they are bound to do so. 5. Duty of Railway Company to Keep Lights, etc. — It is the duty of a railway company to keep lights at proper times at its depots, approaches, and other places connected therewith, which are likely to be visited by passengers and persons lawfully on the premises; and a negligent omission of such duty causing injury would entitle the injured party, without fault on his part, to damages. But see facts where such duty was not shown. 6. Charge to Find for Defendant. — Where the evidence shows that the death for which damages are claimed was attributable to his negligence, without fault on the part of the defendant or its employes, it was the duty of the court to instruct the jury to find for the defendant. Appeal from Hays. Tried below before Hon. H. Teichmueller. Gustave Cook, Ford & Neighbors, J. J. Butts, and J. M. Moore, for appellant. 1. The court erred in instructing the jury to find for the defendant, because the evidence before the court showed, that the plaintiff, Pauline Rozwadosfskie, anticipating that her husband would arrive on defendant’s train incapacitated to care for and protect himself by reason of his intoxicated and imbecile condition, sent her two sons, Frank and Martin Rozwadosfskie, to defendant’s depot at San Marcos, to meet him on his arrival there and conduct him safely home. That her two sons were at said depot lawfully, and were intimidated, frightened, and terrified by the rough language of C. Collins, with threats to have them put in jail unless they should leave and not come back to said depot any more, by reason of which conduct and threats her said sons left said depot before the arrival of the train bringing their father, plaintiff’s husband. That, her said sons, on former occasions and under similar circumstances, had met their father, plaintiff’s husband, at defendant’s depot and conducted him safely home, and would have done so on this occasion had they not been unlawfully driven away from defendant’s depot by its agent, C. Collins, in the manner and under the circumstances aforesaid; and that the driving off of plaintiff’s said sons from said depot, and preventing them from meeting their father, plaintiff's husband, on his arrival at defendant’s depot at San Marcos, and conducting him safely home, was the immediate and proximate cause of the deceased being then and there injured by defendant’s freight train, and his consequent death, and defendant is legally responsible for his death.

Law Rys., secs. 864, 885; Railway v. Sullivan, 81 Ky., 624. 2. It is an implied condition in a contract with a passenger, especially as to an infirm passenger, that his friends may enter the depot and grounds at the place of destination to receive and care for him, and the wanton refusal to permit this is a breach of the carrier’s contract, entitling recovery for any resulting injury; and if the passenger from any cause be insensible, defendant is estopped from pleading contributory negligence. Hamilton v. Railway, 64 Texas, 253. 3. The court below erred in instructing the jury to find a verdict for the defendant; because the defendant was guilty of gross negligence in not having its depot, platform, grounds, and approaches thereto so lighted as that the several agents and employes, in operating approaching trains, could see persons and obstructions on or near said depot, tracks, or platform and approaches thereto; and by reason of such gross negligence on the part of defendant, it is liable and responsible in law to plaintiff in damages for the death of her said husband.

The undisputed evidence in the case shows, that plaintiff’s deceased husband entered upon a passenger train of defendant at Kyle, Texas; that he was under the influence of liquor, but not imbecile; that he was safely transported by defendant to San Marcos, his destination, and there safely delivered; and that, after reaching San Marcos, he left defendant’s depot and depot grounds safely and went up into the town of San Marcos, and there remained for sometime; and that the relation of carrier and passenger between him and defendant had, long before he received the injuries which caused his death, entirely ended, and therefore plaintiff had no cause of action, under the facts in evidence, against defendant for any failure to safely and securely transport her said husband from Kyle to San Marcos.

There was no evidence whatever to show that the persons operating said train were guilty of any negligence whereby plaintiff’s husband was injured; and inasmuch as plaintiff’s said husband was when injured voluntarily upon the track of defendant, it devolved upon her to prove affirmatively that his death was caused through the negligence of defendant's servants in operating the train which ran over him, and that deceased was guilty of no negligence contributing to his death; and in the absence of such proof plaintiff has no cause of action against defendant.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This suit was brought by the widow and children of S. M. Brown, deceased, to recover damages for injuries resulting in the death of said Brown, alleged to have been caused by the gross negligence of the servants of defendant in the operation of a switch engine on defendant’s railway, and over a public crossing, in the town of Orange. Defendant pleaded contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. The accident occurred March 29, 1887. As the law stood then, the defendant was only liable for the ‘ ‘ unfitness, gross negligence, or carelessness” of its servants. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 2899, and note. Defendant requested the court to charge the jury, that the evidence was insufficient to establish gross negligence on the part of the defendant, its agents, servants, or employes, and to find a verdict for the defendant. The refusal of the court to give this instruction has been assigned as error. There is evidence tending to show that the switch engine was being run across the public street at the rate of about fifteen miles an hour, and that no warning of its approach was given by the ringing of the bell on the engine or the blowing of the whistle. It was admitted that there was an ordinance prohibiting the running of trains in the town of Orange faster than six miles an hour; and there was evidence that the blowing of the whistle was also prohibited by ordinance. From all the evidence in the case the jury might have found that there was gross negligence on the part of the engineer and fireman in the running of the switch engine that struck .and hurt the deceased, and the charge was correctly refused. But the question of contributory negligence, the fact of which is also raised by proper assignments of error, does not depend upon the freedom of defendant’s servants from negligence. If the want of due care on the part of the deceased was the proximate cause of the injuries which resulted in his death, then the plaintiffs can not recover, although the defendant’s servants may have been guilty of negligence. Railway v. Peay, 20 S. W. Rep., 57. The evidence shows that just before the accident the engine had passed over the crossing, going east on the main track, and was returning, going west on the switch. Deceased had started on the usual way to his home, along a plank sidewalk over a marsh. Some of the witnesses testified that he was on the sidewalk, where it was a part of the public crossing, but others place him below the crossing. Some say that his side was to the engine, and others that his back was to it. All of the evidence conclusively shows that deceased stepped upon the track just in front of the engine, where there was nothing to obstruct the view. He said to his son, who ran up to him within two minutes after he was hurt, “ I was on the railway and did not know it was coming back until it struck and killed me.” There is a conflict of evidence as to how far the engine was from the deceased when he stepped upon the track. It varies from fifty feet to two or three feet, as stated by the engineer, Middleton. It would seem from the testimony of some of the witnesses that he was walking alongside of the track, when he stepped upon it, and from others that he approached and went directly on it. It is not made clear just how deceased approached the track, but it is not shown that he exercised any care or precaution whatever. Several school children were passing on their way home to dinner, and the hat of one of them had fallen in the marsh, and deceased in his direction to the child about recovering the hat, seemingly failed to notice the approach of the engine, and was struck. The accident was a deplorable one, and but for the absorption of the deceased in the recovery of the child’s hat, we have no doubt would not have occurred. He was shown to be a man of most exemplary habits and usually careful. One of the witnesses said that he-had frequently warned the children of the danger at the crossing. But from the evidence we can not escape the conclusion that the accident was contributed to by the want of due care on the part of the deceased in going upon the track of the defendant in front of the approaching engine. It was a public crossing, and deceased, if on the crossing, was not a trespasser upon the track; but he was bound to the exercise of care in the use of the crossing, and the evidence showing that the accident was contributed to 'by negligence of deceased in going upon the track, when by the use of ordinary care he could have discovered the. engine and avoided the accident, plaintiffs ought not to recover. There are several assignments of error upon the charge of the court. We think that the charge is in the main a very correct one; but the latter part of the eighteenth paragraph is, as contended, inapplicable to the facts. The paragraph is as follows: “It was the duty of Dr. Brown, when he entered upon or onto defendant’s switch, to have used his senses of hearing and sight; and if he failed to do so, even though defendant should by you be found to be guilty of gross negligence, still his heirs can not recover, as such failure to so use his senses would be in law contributory negligence, unless you should find the motion of defendant’s engine was so rapid as to render the exercise of his senses by him useless, and of no avail to avert injury.” Such a charge was calculated to mislead the jury. The deceased would not be excused from the exercise of care in going upon the track because the engine was running at a rapid rate. The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 9, 1893.","Texas & New Orleans Railway Company v. Georgia Brown et al. No. 73. 1. Contributory Negligence—Standing on the Track.—Just before the accident the engine had passed over the crossing, going east, and was returning, going west. Deceased stepped on the track just in front of the engine when there was nothing to obstruct the view. Just after he was struck, he said: “ I was on the railway, and did not know it was coming back, until it struck and killed me.” Held, contributory negligence, preventing a recovery, although there was evidence tending to show that the engine was running at fifteen miles per hour, when by city ordinance they were prohibited from running faster than six miles per hour. 2. Erroneous Charge on Contributory Negligence. —The latter clause of the following charge held erroneous: “ It was the duty of Dr. Brown when he entered upon or onto defendant’s switch, to have used his senses of hearing and sight; and if he failed to do so, even though defendant should be found by you to be guilty of gross negligence, still his heirs can not recover, as such failure to use his senses would be in law contributory negligence, unless you should find the motion of defendant's engine was so rapid as to render the exercise of his senses by him useless and of no avail to avert the injury.” Appeal from Orange.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. The record contains neither statement of facts, motion for new trial, nor exceptions to the conclusions of law and findings of fact filed by the judge who tried the cause below. The points raised really relate to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conclusions of law. Inasmuch as the facts found do not affirmatively show that the conclusions of law and judgment were erroneous, we might dispose of the case, in the present state of the record, upon that ground alone. We think, however, the facts stated in the findings sufficiently show liability of appellant as a tenant holding over, for the sum adjudged against him; and also that he was not liable, as claimed by appellee, after notice given of the termination of the relation of landlord and tenant. The court found that Putnam was appellee’s agent, and that appellee received notice through him, and held that the twelve days notice before the time when the next rental year would begin was sufficient time. The record shows nothing to enable us to say this was not correct. Affirmed. Delivered March 9, 1893.","L. Ward v. The New York and Texas Land Company, Limited. No. 224. 1. Practice in Court of Civil Appeals — Record. —When the record contains neither statement of facts nor exceptions to the conclusions of law and findings of fact of the court below, and the points raised by the assignments of error relate to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conclusions of law, and the facts found do not affirmatively show that the conclusions of law were erroneous, the case might be disposed of on that ground alone. 2. Landlord and Tenant.—A tenant holding over under a lease from year to year, rent payable in advance, will not be held liable to his landlord for rents after he has notified him that he would no longer pay rent, if said notice was given twelve days before the rent year for which he is sought to be charged had begun. Appeal from Jackson. Tried below before Hon. H. L. White, County Judge. The conclusions of fact of the court below were as follows: “ 1. I find that plaintiff now is, and has been ever since June 13,1884, the owner of the lands, the rent of which is in controversy. “ 2. I find that plaintiff leased the lands to defendant under a written contract of lease for the term of three years, beginning June 14, 1884, and terminating June 13, 1887, at the rate of 896 per annum, in advance. “3. I find that the use, occupation, and control exercised by the defendant during the continuance of this lease was to graze his cattle and other stock upon the lands. “ 4. I find that defendant never took actual possession of plaintiff’s land, even during the term of the lease, except that the lands were enclosed in a pasture with lands owned by defendant and others; and that the cattle of the other parties owning land in said pasture grazed on said lands, as well as defendant’s cattle. “ 5. I find that on June 14, 1889, neither plaintiff nor defendant was in actual possession, nor had the defendant any cattle on the land until the fall of said year, as about that year defendant had commenced removing his stock from that pasture in the spring, and putting them back in the fall to winter. “ 6. I find that the rent was payable annually in advance; that for each year during the term of the lease plaintiff did notify defendant, before the rent became due, of the day it would be due, and that defendant paid when so notified; and the last rent paid was paid in advance for the year commencing June 14, 1886. “ 7. I find that plaintiff did not notify defendant of any rents due in advance for the years beginning June 14, 1887, 1888, or 1889; and not until about June 1, 1890, did defendant receive notice that he must pay rent; nor did defendant notify plaintiff that he did not intend to pay rent for the years beginning June 14, 1887, 1888, and 1889, nor until June 1, 1890, when requested to pay rent for these years by P. P. Putnam, plaintiff’s agent. “ 8. I find that defendant had other lands lying in a different county from this (Jackson County), leased from plaintiff; that at the expiration of said lease on said other lands, plaintiff wrote to the defendant, inquiring if said defendant desired to renew said lease of said other lands, to which inquiry defendant replied that he did not. “9. I find that defendant has had since the expiration of said written lease (that is, the lease to the lands in controversy) the same use, occupation, and benefit of the lands down to the present time that he had during the continuance of the written lease, but defendant did not consider that he had control of the land. “ 10. I find the rental value of the premises to be 896 per annum.” W. A. McDowell, for appellant. The holding over must be an actual holding. The tenant must continue in actual or constructive possession in order to be chargeable with rents. Railway v. Torrey, 4 Willson’s C. C., 445. West & McGown, for appellee. Appellant having entered into a written lease with appellee, which expired June 13, 1887, and having remained in possession of the land with the consent of appellee, the relation of landlord and tenant between appellee and appellant continued to exist at the time of the institution of this action.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. The following agreement, entered into by the parties to this appeal, presents the questions involved in this cause: “ 1. On May 26, 1890, J. N. McFaden and G-. W. Logan, who composed the copartnership of McFaden & Logan, applied to the local station agent of H. C. Cross and George A. Eddy, receivers of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway, at Taylor Station, in Williamson County, Texas, for cars to be in readiness at that place on May 30, 1890, in which to ship on that date 85 head of beef cattle to the Chicago market. The said station agent received the application, and promis* if cars could be gotten, to have them in readiness at said station on said date for the shipment of said cattle. “ 2. Between 10 a. m. and 12 m. of said May 30, McFaden & Logan tendered to the said receivers’ agent at said Taylor Station the said 85 head of cattle to be received and transported by them to Chicago, and at that time the said cars, which had been ordered on said May 26, were in the yards at said station and in readiness to be used for such purpose. The agent refused to receive said cattle for shipment, when tendered as aforesaid, until other cattle in the pens and yard awaiting shipment could be loaded out. “ 3. Late in the evening the cattle were penned, and thereafter kept in the ¡lens for about twenty-four hours before being shipped out, whereby, and by reason of injuries received en route, and a decline in the market, the cattle were damaged in the amount of the judgment — $343. “ 4, The reason the said cattle were not received by said agent on said May 30th, and shipped out on that date, was an unusual and unprecedented rush of transit and local cattle at said Taylor Station on said day, which transit cattle had been received from connecting lines and local cattle from shippers at a date subsequent to May 26, the day when the cars were ordered as aforesaid. The said receivers had, on the occasion of the unprecedented rush, ample facilities for handling the ordinary cattle traffic at said station, and plaintiffs’ cattle could have been shipped out when tendered had they been given precedence over the other cattle. “It is agreed between the parties hereto, acting through their respective counsel, that the only question for decision is: “Is a common carrier, who agrees to furnish at a certain time and place, if they can be gotten, cars for the transportation of live stock, and who has on hand at the time and place specified the cars applied for, relieved from liability for damage from delay in the shipment of the live stock after tender of same by the party making application, because of an unusual and unprecedented accumulation of live stock at said time and place, received in transitu from connecting carriers and local shippers; all of said live stock being received after the day upon which the application for cars was made, and some after the live stock of the party so applying had been tendered for shipment ? In other words, has the common carrier the legal right to give precedence of shipment to the live stock received as aforesaid from connecting carriers and local shippers over the stock tendered by the shipper who has applied for cars to take his stock out on a day certain, without being liable to such shipper for resulting damage ?” These facts show a contract between the parties, wherein the carrier agreed to furnish cars, if they could be procured, at a certain time and place, to be used by the shipper in transporting his cattle to the Chicago market. The shipper ajfeed to deliver the cattle for shipment at the time and place agreed oh. The facts show that the cattle were delivered and presented for shipment at the time and place agreed on, and that cars were on hand that could have been used for the purpose of shipping said cattle; but the agent of appellants refused to receive and ship the'cattle at the time agreed on, because the cars were being used for the purpose of shipping other live stock. Delivered November 9, 1892. We know of no law that prohibits the making of contracts such as this; and when entered into they are to be governed by the ordinary and general rules of construction that relate to contracts and the breaches thereof. In the absence of this contract the defense and excuse presented by appellants for failing to promptly ship the cattle would ordinarily excuse the carrier from liability. But such is not the case here, as the rights of the parties rest upon the contract. And for a breach of the contract by the carrier, it is as much liable as for other violated engagements that it is permitted to enter into. The cars being on hand, the carrier should have performed its engagement; and for its refusal to so do, it is liable for the damages resulting from such breach of the contract. Railway v. Nicholson, 61 Texas, 495; Railway v. McCorquodale, 71 Texas, 46. The judgment of the court below is affirmed. Affirmed.","H. C. Cross and George A. Eddy v. McFaden & Logan. No. 656. 1. Contract by Railway Company to Furnish Cattle Cars. — We know of no law prohibiting a railway company from contracting with cattle owners to furnish cars at an agreed time and place on the line of the road to be used by the owners of the cattle in theirtshipment. The refusal to permit shippers to use cars so furnished, and resulting in damage, gives cause of action. 2. Same — Excuse.—In absence of.such contract to furnish cars, the defense would be allowed that the delay was caused by an unusual and unprecedented accumulation of live stock for shipment at the time and place. 3. Case in Judgment. — Contract by railway company to furnish stock cars at a given time and place. The cars wero at the place, and on the day specified the shippers tendered the cattle for shipment on the cars. The use of the cars was refused, on alleged ground that other cattle had priority in time. Held, the refusal was a breach of the contract, and for delay resulting, action would lie. Appeal from the County Court of Williamson. Tried below before Hon. D. S. Chesher. Fisher & Townes, for appellants. 1. Under the agreed facts appellants’ delay in receiving and delivering appellees’ cattle was excused, and they were relieved from all liability for damages resulting therefrom. Rev. Stats., art. 4251; Railway v. Smith, 63 Texas, 323, 326, 327; Railway v. Levi, 76 Texas, 337; Railway v. Tisdale, 74 Texas, 8, 17; Hutch, on Carr., secs. 292, 296, 329, 330; 2 Beach on Rys., sec. 935; Railway v. Rea, 18 Ill., 488; Peet v. Railway, 20 Wis., 594; Railway v. Hallowell, 65 Ind., 189; Railway v. Ragsdale, 46 Miss., 458; Railway v. Haynes, 64 Miss., 604. 2. The law distinguishes between causes sufficient to relieve a common carrier against loss or total failure to deliver, and those that will excuse the carrier from delay in delivery. In the one case, the loss can not be relieved against unless it result from the act of God or the public enemy; and in the other, the cause, although not inevitable or produced by the act of God, may be sufficient to excuse the delay. The reason for the distinction is, the law binds the carrier to deliver absolutely, unless prevented by the act of God or the public enemy, but only requires delivery to be made within a reasonable time; the question what is a reasonable time to be tested by the facts and surroundings of each particular case. 3. That the cattle in the yards and pens at Taylor, when appellees’ cattle were tendered for shipment, were received for shipment after the day on which appellees applied for cars to be at the station on the 30th of May, did not under the facts give appellees the right to priority or precedence of shipment over the other cattle. Rev. Stats., art. 4251; 63 Texas, 323, 326, 327; Hutch, on Carr., secs. 297, 298, 327. *4. A common carrier of live stock or other freight must receive and transport same in the order in which it is received, even if cars, applied for by a shipper to be in readiness on a day certain to carry his cattle, are on hand, if other cattle are received for carriage before such shipper’s cattle are tendered. Rev. Stats., art. 4251; Railway v. Smith, 63 Texas, 323, 326, 327; Hutch, on Carr., secs. 297, 298, 327. 5. The mere fact that cars applied for to be on hand on a day certain are on hand, gives the applicant, who tenders on that day cattle for shipment, no priority of right of shipment over the other shippers whose cattle are received in advance of his. J. W. Parker, for appellees. 1. It is lawful for a common carrier, in good faith and without any purpose of discriminating against other shippers, to contract in advance for the receipt and transportation of freight on its line on a certain day, and to give such freight precedence; and especially is this true with reference to live stock, which, from its very nature, requires a fixed time to be agreed upon for its tender by the shipper and receipt by the carrier; and appellees’ cattle could have been shipped out when tendered if they had been given precedence. The authorities cited by appellants in support of said propositions all apply to the transportation of freight tendered in regular course, without any prior agreement or understanding between the shipper and carrier. Acts 20th Leg., 133. 2. The law which requires railway carriers to receive the cars and freight from connecting lines and to transport the same, does not intend that preference shall be given to such cars or freight over freight which the carrier has already legally bound itself to receive and transport on a day certain. To do this would be to subordinate the business of the carrier to that of its connecting lines, which can not be the purpose of the law. Rev. Stats., art. 4251. ' 3. The promise of appellants’ agent to have cars for the transportation of appellees’ cattle at Taylor Station on May 30, provided the cars could be gotten, was equivalent to promising to receive and transport appellees’ cattle at said station on said date, provided the cars could be gotten; and appellants having gotten the cars, they can not excuse their refusal to receive and transport the said cattle when tendered by appellees, upon the ground of an unforeseen and unexpected contingency, such as an unusual and unprecedented rush of business. In other words, appellants having charged themselves with the duty of receiving and transporting appellees’ cattle, provided they could get the necessary cars, and having gotten them, they were bound to make their promise good or respond in damages, which it is agreed in this case equals the amount of the judgment.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellee sued appellants, in trespass to try title, for the land in controversy. Judgment was rendered in the District Court in appellee’s favor for the land, and cancelling a deed from T= J. Russell to his wife, under which they defended. Appellee showed title as follows: Judgment in his favor against Russell for $1192.25, dated May, 1890, affirmed by Supreme Court February 24, 1891; abstract thereof duly registered, February 26, 1891; execution March 14, 1891; sale April 7, 1891, of the land in controversy, and purchase thereat by himself, and deed to him by the sheriff. Mrs. Russell asserted title under a deed from her husband of date February 9, 1891, which was not filed for record until March 9, 1891. Appellants claimed, also, that the land was their homestead at the time of the recording of the abstract, the levy of the execution, and the sale thereunder. Appellee, at the time his abstract was filed, and when the execution was levied, had no notice of the deed from Russell to his wife, but received notice before the sale. He also attacked the deed from Russell to his wife, on the ground that it was made with the intent to hinder, delay, and defraud Russell’s creditors. The facts in regard to the claim of homestead, as found by the district judge, and shown by the evidence, are as follows: Russell and his first wife, up to 1873, occupied the land as their homestead. They were then divorced, and Russell continued to live on the place until he married his present wife, in December, 1883. She refused to' live there, and neither of them have since done so, though they have gotten some firewood, vegetables, fruits, and the like, from their tenants on the place, which they used for family purposes. The land lies three miles from Beaumont. In 1890 Russell bought lots 15 and 16, in block 4 of the Calder addition to Beaumont, after the same had been cut up into blocks, lots, streets, etc., and a map thereof placed of record. His lots front on Calder Avenue, and he immediately built and occupied, with his wife, his residence on these two lots, and was so living upon and occupying them at the time of this trial in the District Court. He paid for the lots, but there is a lien upon them for balance due for improvements. There were houses north, east, south, and west of him, and lots in the Calder addition were then worth from $250 to $600, the defendant paying $625 for his. A part of this Calder addition runs up to the Crosby Hotel, the chief hotel in the city, though the addition itself lies just outside the corporate limits. The town was incorporated in 1881. The superintendent of the city public schools lives across the street from defendants. Russell is a practicing lawyer and keeps an office in Beaumont. The court found, as a fact, that the Calder addition was a part of the town of Beaumont, and that appellants’ homestead was in the town. The court below held, that the lien acquired by appellee from the registration of the abstract and levy of the execution, was superior to thé deed to Mrs. Russell, and held that such deed was made in fraud of creditors and that the land was not homestead, and that therefore appellee was entitled to recover. Many of the assignments of error relate to alleged mistakes made by the trial judge in the statement of facts, and will not be noticed. There are propositions in appellants' brief, seeking to make the point that evidence, offered by appellee, to meet the claim of title asserted under the deed to Mrs. Russell, was not admissible under the pleadings. There was no objection to the evidence when offered in the court below, no motion for new trial, nor exceptions to the findings of the judge, nor was the point in any way called to the attention of the trial court. It is too late to present it for the first time in this court, and it can not be considered. There was no error in sustaining the plaintiff’s exceptions to defendants’ answer, alleging that the plaintiff had not paid to the sheriff the costs of former suit upon his purchase of the land. The sheriff had made the deed to plaintiff, and whether or not he had paid the costs was an inquiry which could not affect the issues involved in this suit. It was shown at the trial that he did pay the costs and had the balance of his bid credited on the execution. It was competent for plaintiff to inquire into the consideration of the prior deed from Russell to his wife for another tract of land, for the purpose of showing that thereby the alleged debt which formed the consideration of the deed in question had been paid, wholly or partially, as well as to develop facts pertinent to the question of fraud. It is too well settled to require citation of authority, that a judgment creditor who acquires a lien on land, through registration of an abstract or levy of an execution, acquires a right superior to that of the grantee in a prior unrecorded deed from his debtor, of which such creditor has no notice. It follows, that under the evidence in the case, unless appellants sustained their claim that the land was their homestead, no judgment was proper but that which was rendered. As to such claim, the evidence amply sustains the finding of the court below, that they had abandoned the rural homestead and acquired another in a town or city. They could not hold both, and the land in controversy was therefore subject. This renders it unnecessary to pass upon the other questions raised in appellants’ brief as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conclusions of the lower court upon other points. Whether such findings were correct or not, the evidence in the particulars we have indicated sustains the judgment, and it is therefore affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered December 15, 1892.","Thomas J. Russell and Wife v. W. H. Nall. No. 55. 1. Judgment Lien .—Judgment was rendered February 24,1891, abstract of judgment was recorded February 26, execution issued March 14, and sale made April 7,1891, of the land in controversy, which was held by the wife of appellant under deed dated February 9,1891, and recorded March 9,1891. Held, it is too Well settled to require citation of authority, that a judgment creditor having acquired a lien on land through registration of an abstract, or levy of an execution, acquires right superior to that of the grantee of a prior unrecorded deed from the debtor of which such creditor has no notice. 2.

Registration of Deed from Husband to Wife. —The property in controversy was owned by the defendant before his marriage. By his deed to his-wife she acquired the legal title, which is within the operation of the registration laws, and is not affected by the doctrine of resulting trusts, as announced in Boss v. Kornrumpf, 64 Texas, 390; McICamey v. Thorp, 61 Texas, 648; Parker v. Coop, 60 Texas, 111; Senter v. Lambeth, 59 Texas, 260; Blankenship v. Douglas, 26 Texas, 229. 8.

The numerous falsehoods inserted in the statement of facts, which appear to be in the handwriting of plaintiff’s attorneys, were inserted for the purpose of defrauding the defendants and sustaining an erroneous judgment, and the court, in the press of business, while holding court in another county, overlooked the said errors, and thus inadvertently approved the statement of facts that is false in many respects. 5. The court erred in signing and approving the statement of facts in this cause, with that part thereof wherein is pretended to be given the testimony of the several witnesses, with the false, fraudulent, and erroneous statement, as heretofore pointed out; as the affidavits and record evidence filed herewith and the motion to correct the record will show. FBOM MOTION FOB EEHEAEING. The court below, in its conclusions, from some cause other than law and justice, made the statement that said deed was made in fraud of creditors, when there was no such charge made in plaintiff’s pleadings, and no evidence to found such a conclusion in the opinion of an honest man. And in connection herewith the court is asked to consider the seventh conclusion of the court, that the deed of Tom J. Russell “ was made without consideration,” etc., and it will find that said conclusion of the court is a false one, and directly in the face of the undisputed facts. The eighteenth and nineteenth assignments of error are referred to. All of these are connected with the question of fraud in the deed of Tom J. Russell to his wife, of February 9, 1891, which the court below, without any plea raising the question of fraud, attempted to lug into the case for the purpose of injuring the appellants. Greer & Greer, for appellee."
"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. No error was committed by the court below in overruling the general demurrer to the petition. While a carrier of passengers is not liable as an insurer of money or other baggage retained in the possession and control of the passenger and lost during the trip, he is bound to use proper care to prevent loss of or injury to it; and if such property or money be lost, as a proximate consequence of negligence of the carrier, he is responsible. 2 Rorer on Rys., 994, 995; Carpenter v. Railway 124 N. Y., 53. The petition, sufficiently to meet a general demurrer, showed that the money was lost by reason of defendant’s negligence, and expressly denied that any carelessness of the plaintiff contributed. The fact that plaintiff took off his coat and placed it on the seat occupied by him can not be considered such negligence as would preclude him from recovering. There might be losses of property to which such an act of a passenger would contribute in such a manner as to make him chargeable with contributory negligence. But it is not perceived that such would be the case under the facts here alleged. The money is charged to have been lost through the overturning of a coach into the water, brought about by negligence of the defendant. Plaintiff’s act in riding with his coat off in no way helped to bring about that occurrence, which was the immediate cause of the loss. The petition showed that the loss of the money was caused directly and immediately by the fault of the company, through which the car was overturned, without the intervention of negligence of the plaintiff, or of any other cause. The damage claimed was not therefore too remote. The other assignments of error go to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the judgment. Most of them present the questions above discussed in passing upon the petition, and what is there said is sufficient to dispose of all the points raised in appellants’ brief, except those presented in the third and fourth assignments and the propositions based upon them. The second proposition under the third assignment is, in substance, that appellee failed to sustain by proof his allegation that appellants were guilty of negligence. The only evidence on this point is, that while the train was on the bridge near the edge of Galveston Bay, the coach in which appellee was sitting was overturned into the water by some cause unknown to him. No effort was made on either side to explain the accident or to show what caused it. We think tlie court was justified in inferring negligence from the nature of the occurrence and the place at which it took place. While the mere happening of an accident to a passenger train does not necessarily make out a prima facie case of negligence in the carrier, so as to authorize a court to so charge a jury, it is nevertheless evidence to be considered by the court or jury in determining whether or not negligence existed. In many cases the mishap is of such a nature as, in itself, when unexplained. affords satisfactory proof of the facts. We think this is such a case. Railway v. Suggs, 62 Texas, 324. We can not assent to the proposition of appellants, that their liability could only arise upon proof of gross negligence. See authorities above cited. Under their fourth assignment appellants claim that appellee shows himself to have been guilty of negligence after the mishap occurred, in not making proper efforts to recover liis money. His is the only testimony in the case. He stated, that as soon as he had gotten out of the overturned coach, he called for his coat, and some one unknown to him brought it to him; that he immediately examined for his money, and both it and the pocket-book which contained it were gone, and that he had never since seen or heard of either. He does not show that he made any effort to find it, or any inquiry for it, nor that he notified the servants of appellant that he had lost it, or in any way called upon them to recover it for him. So far as the record shows, they knew nothing of the fact that he had lost or ever had the money. A plaintiff is not required ordinarily to assume the burden of showing that he has not been guilty of negligence; but when the facts which he states expose him to the suspicion that he negligently contributed to his loss, he must clear away such suspicion before he will be permitted to recover. We think the latter rule applies here. It is not probable that in the overturning of the car the money was destroyed. Its ownership was not changed; it remained the property of appellee. Notwithstanding the negligence of appellants, it was still his duty to act as a reasonably prudent person would ordinarily act under like circumstances, and if by so doing he could have prevented the final loss of his property, he ought not to recover. This principle, we think, would require that one situated as he was make such reasonable efforts to regain his property as the situation allowed. Certainly it would require that he at least give notice of his loss to those whom he proposed to charge with responsibility, in order that they might protect both him and themselves, if possible, by recovery of the money. If the circumstances were such that none of these things could have been done, or such as would have rendered ineffectual any efforts to find the money, that should have been shown. As the evidence stands it does not warrant the judgment rendered. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded Delivered March 2, 1893.","Bonner and Eddy, Receivers, v. Charles Grumbach. No. 223. 1. Liability of Carrier for Money of Passenger. — Plaintiff, a passenger on a railway, entered the passenger coach, and the weather being warm, took off his coat and laid it across the back of his seat. In one of the pockets, in a pocket-book, was the sum of $240, the property of plaintiff. Near the end of the bridge crossing Galveston Bay the car was overturned, as alleged, through the gross carelessness of the company and its servants; plaintiff was thrown from his seat, and his coat thrown out of the coach. It was afterward found and returned to plaintiff, but the money was gone, and it is alleged that the money was lost to plaintiff without his fault or neglect. Held, the petition was good against a general demurrer. 2. Same.—While a carrier of passengers is not liable as an insurer of money or other baggage in the control of the passenger and lost during the trip, if such money or property be lost as the proximate consequence of the negligence of the carrier, he is responsible. The fact that the plaintiff took off his coat and placed it on his seat can not be considered as such negligence as would preclude him from recovering. 3. When Negligence may be Inferred from the Happening of the Accident.—While the mere happening of the accident to a passenger train does not necessarily make out a prima facie case of negligence in the carrier, it is nevertheless evidence to be considered by the court or jury in determining whether or not negligence existed. In many instances the mishap is of such a nature as in itself, when unexplained, affords satisfactory proof of the fact. We think this is such a case. 4. Gross Negligence.—Plaintiff in this case was not required to show gross negligence. 5. Duty of the Plaintiff — Efforts to Protect Himself Against Loss.—When his coat was brought to him after the accident, he examined for his money, and found it and the pocket-book gone. He does not show that he made any effort to find it, nor that he notified the servants of the appellees that he had lost it, or in any way called on them to recover it for him. So far as the record shows, they knew nothing of the fact that he had lost or ever had the money. When the facts expose the plaintiff to the suspicion that he has negligently contributed to his loss, he must clear away such suspicion before he will be permitted to recover. He must at least give notice of his loss to the carrier in order that they may protect both him and themselves, if possible, by the recovery of the money. Appeal from Harris. Tried below before Hon. W. C. Anders, County-Judge. Ford & McComb, for appellants. 1. A railway company is not liable to a passenger for money lost, while travelling as such passenger, from the pocket of his coat, which coat he had taken off and laid across the back of the seat occupied by him, under 'circumstances such as alleged by appellee. The allegation of negligence is insufficient, and petition is also for that reason defective. The claim for damages is too remote. 2 Red. Am. Ry. Cases, 24, note; 5 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 5, 6, notes 2, 1. 2. A passenger is guilty of contributory negligence who puts a large sum of money in the side pocket of his dress coat, and then takes the coat off and hangs it across the seat occupied by him in the railway coach; he should keep the money on his person. Appellee failed to exercise ordinary care in relation to his money, and thereby proximately contributed to his own injury and loss; he is therefore not entitled to recover. 4 Am. and Eng.

If appellee, after finding his money was not in his coat pocket, could or might have found the same and had it restored to him by the use of ordinary diligence, and if he failed to exercise such diligence to find and recover his money, he would not be entitled to recover in this, suit.

It was not negligence for plaintiff to pull off his coat, in the pocket of which, in a pocket-book, was his money, and hang or place the same on his seat in the car in his immediate presence, nor did this act contribute to the accident or in any way cause the loss of his said money and property.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. January 5, 1891, in the District Court of Tarrant County, appellee, as plaintiff, brought this suit against appellants, as defendants, upon certain acceptances in the aggregate sum of $1422.82. From a judgment in behalf of appellee for this amount, rendered June 25, 1891, appellants prosecute this appeal. There is in the record an agreed statement of the facts proved. The terms of this agreement, with reference to the interstate character of the transaction involved and liereinbelow referred to, are to some extent vague and indefinite. As interpreted by us, however, and by the parties in their briefs, the agreement shows substantially as follows: That at the date of the acceptances and of the institution of this suit, and of the rendition of the judgment, the plaintiff was a foreign corporation for pecuniary profit, organized under the laws of the State of Kansas, and that at said, dates it was and had been, through its commercial agents and otherwise, soliciting business in the State of Texas, and as such had sold goods to the defendants in this cause and to various other persons and firms in Texas; that it had no general office or special place of business in this State; that at said dates it had failed to file its articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas, for the purpose of procuring a permit under the provisions of the Act of the Legislature of the State of Texas, approved April 3, 1889; that the acceptances sued on were executed in consideration of certain goods and merchandise purchased by the defendants in Fort Worth, Texas, from plaintiff, through its commercial agent or drummer; that in pursuance of said purchase the goods in question were shipped by the appellee in the State of Kansas, thence transported and delivered to the appellants in Fort Worth, Texas. The Act of the Legislature referred to requires that foreign corporations (save in certain specified cases) desiring “ to transact business in this State, or solicit business in this State, or establish a general or special office in this State,” shall file with the Secretary of State a duly certified copy of their articles of incorporation. It further provides, that on failure to so file such articles of incorporation, 1 ‘ no such corporation can maintain any suit or action, either legal or equitable, in any of the courts of this State, upon any demand,” etc. It further provides, that in order to procure such permit, such corporation shall pay a fee, ranging from $25 to $200, according to the amount of its capital stock. The contention of appellants is, that the failure of plaintiff to comply with the Act of the Legislature above referred to defeats its right to maintain this suit. The contention of appellee is, that to it, as a foreign corporation engaged in interstate commerce, this statute is inapplicable; or, if sought to be applied, that it is unconstitutional and void — that it is repugnant to the “ commerce clause” of the Federal Constitution. The principle is well established, that it rests purely within the discretion of a State to recognize or to repudiate a foreign corporation; that it can, if such be its pleasure, exclude such a corporation entirely, or admit it conditionally. This principle, however, is not of universal application. A very emphatic and well fixed instance in which it does not obtain, is where a foreign corporation is engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. Horn Silver Mining Co. v. New York, 148 U. S., 314. That provision of the Federal Constitution which provides that 1 ‘ Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States,” constitutes such regulation a domain of legislation peculiarly within Federal prerogative. The question then arises: Was the corporation plaintiff in this case engaged in interstate commerce, within the meaning of the Federal Constitution ? The record, as we understand it, discloses that plaintiff corporation shipped, from its domicile in Kansas, goods and merchandise to Fort Worth, Texas, and there delivered them, or caused them to be delivered, to appellants, for which the indebtedness sued on was contracted. These goods were commodities of barter and sale — the essence of commerce; and the business in which the corporation plaintiff was engaged consisted in transactions of this character. It must be held, therefore, that the sale, transportation, and delivery of merchandise under such circumstances, and in the transaction of such business from one State to another, constituted an interstate commercial transaction within the meaning of the commerce clause in question, which applies as well to commerce carried on by corporations as to that carried on by individuals. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall., 181; Robbins v. Taxing District, 120 U. S., 489; Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, 111 U. S., 196; see also opinion of Matthews and Blatchford, Justices, in Mfg. Co. v. Ferguson, 113 U. S., 727; Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S., 47-62. We are constrained, therefore, to hold, by virtue of an unavoidable construction of the authorities cited, that the statute invoked, if applied to the corporation plaintiff in this case and to its transactions, would impose conditions and restraints upon interstate commerce; that it would regulate interstate commerce. So understood and so applied, it is in conflict with the constitutional provision referred to, and must be deemed inoperative and void. Singer Mfg. Co. v. Hardee, 16 Pac. Rep., 605; Ware v. Shoe Co., 9 So. Rep., 136. Delivered October 11, 1892. The opinions in the cases last cited, from the Supreme Courts of New Mexico and Alabama respectively, are particularly pertinent here. There are doubtless, however, cases in which the statute in question would be effective, and beneficially so; but it must be held not to be applicable in this case. Appellants addressed to the plaintiff’s petition a special exception, the overruling of which they have assigned as error. We la.y no stress upon this assignment, as in the light of the facts subsequently fully developed, any error committed in reference to the special exception was rendered wholly immaterial. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed.","SECOND DISTRICT, OOTOBER, 1892. Bateman and Brother v. The Western Star Milling Company. No. 502. 1. Foreign. Corporations — Interstate Commerce — The Act of April 3,1889 (Acts Twenty-first Legislature, 87), providing that foreign corporations desiring to transact or solicit business in this State, or establish a general or special office in this State, shall file with the Secretary of State a duly certified copy of the articles of incorporation, and pay afee for a permit issued thereon, and that no such corporation failing to so do can maintain any suit or action, either legal or equitable, in any of the courts of this State, imposes conditions and restraints upon interstate commerce, and is in conflict with the fourth clause of section 8, article 1, of the Federal Constitution, giving to Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States. 2.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Appellee was plaintiff in the court below, and received the injuries for which he recovered damages on the 14th of January, 1890, while he was engaged in loading a car of lumber in the yards of appellant for his employer. While he was thus engaged, appellant negligently allowed other cars to come down on the track on which the car he was loading was standing and run against the same, causing a stick of lumber to fall on his leg. The judgment in the court below was for $600, from which this appeal is prosecuted. This case was submitted to us at a former day of this term upon a suggestion of delay made by appellee under rule 43 of this court. The case had been properly prepared for submission by appellant, and the brief filed by appellee is not in any respect an attempt to comply with the rules of this court in its preparation. In this state of the record we would be authorized to look alone to the brief of appellant, and in such cases this is the practice we shall adopt in the future. The rule under which this submission was taken does not contemplate that in such cases the labor of examining the record in passing upon appellant’s assignments of error shall be incurred; and where appellee suggests delay, and fails to file a brief in compliance with the rules, all the statements of appellant in his brief as to the contents of the record will be considered as acquiesced in. With this rule enforced in this case, we are of opinion that it would be necessary to reverse the judgment rendered by the court below. In its first assignment of error appellant complains of the action of the court in giving the following charge to the jury: “ If the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was engaged at the time of the alleged injury in loading a car on the track of defendant company, and if they further believe from the evidence that while so engaged agents or servants of the defendant company propelled another car against the one the plaintiff was so engaged in loading, and in so doing were guilty of negligence, etc., they should find for plaintiff.” This charge, unless the evidence was of that undisputed character which authorized the court to assume that plaintiff was rightfully on appellant’s track, would be objectionable in assuming such to be the case. It does assume that appellee had the right to be where he was at the time of the injury, and unless the evidence was of the undisputed character indicated above, this would be a question for the jury and not for the court. In order to ascertain whether or not this was in fact the state of the evidence, we have been compelled to go outside of appellant’s brief and examine the record, and upon such examination we have arrived at the conclusion that the court did not err in so assuming in its charge. There seems to have been no conflict in the evidence in showing that appellee at the time he was injured was engaged in loading a car that had been placed by appellant on its side track for this purpose, and while so engaged it is settled in this State that appellant owed him the duty to exercise ordinary care to avoid injuring him. Eason v. Railway, 65 Texas, 577; Bonner and Eddy v. Bryant, 79 Texas, 540. We are, however, of opinion that the court’s action in taking this question from the jury was of such doubtful propriety that appellant should not be visited with the penalty of 10 per cent damages for taking this appeal from the judgment .so rendered. The only other assignment presented in the brief of appellant calls in question the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict, and in passing upon this assignment we have also been compelled to look through the record. Upon an examination of the record, however, we are of the opinion that the evidence preponderated in favor of the verdict. The judgment of the court below will therefore be affirmed without damages, with the assurance, however, that in future when parties elect to submit their cases upon a suggestion of delay, seeking thereby to gain precedence over other cases ahead of them on the docket, no liberality will be indulged in their favor by examining the record further than we are required to do by the rule. Let the judgment of the court below be affirmed without damages. Affirmed. Delivered January 17, 1893.","Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. B. W. Pennell. No. 649. 1. Practice on Appeal—Suggestion of Delay.—Where a case is submitted on a suggestion of delay by appellee under rule 43 of this court, but the appellee fails to file such a brief as complies with the rules, the statements in appellant’s brief as to the contents of the record will be considered as acquiesced in, and will alone be looked to by the court. 2. Same—Damages for Delay.—The action of the court below in taking from the jury a question of fact involved was of doubtful propriety. Held, that the appellant should not be visited with the penalty of 10 per cent damages for taking an appeal from the judgment rendered in such case. 3. Charge of Court Assuming a Fact.—Plaintiff sued a railway company for damages for personal injuries; and the court charged, that “if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was engaged at the time of the alleged injury in loading a car on the track of the defendant company; and if they further believe from the evidence that while so engaged, agents or servants of the defendant company propelled another car against the one the plaintiff was so engaged in loading, and in so doing were guilty of negligence, etc., they should find for plaintiff.” Held, that this charge assumed a material fact, viz., that plaintiff was rightfully on the railway track at the time of the injury; but as the evidence was undisputed on this point, the court might so assume, although the practice is of doubtful propriety.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This is an action by the appellee against the appellant as administrator of the estate of F. M. Huddleston, deceased, in the District Court of Anderson County, upon a rejected claim. Defendant pleaded usury. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, establishing the claim as presented to the. administrator. The facts are: 1. Plaintiff, H. Kemper, on March 3, 1890, was a cotton, factor and commission merchant in the city of Galveston, where he had an office and sample rooms, and employed clerks and carried on his business, to which he gave his personal attention. 2. On March 3, 1890, the plaintiff loaned the defendant’s intestate $3896.63, which was evidenced by several promissory notes payable to plaintiff, with 10 per cent interest until maturity, and after maturity 12 per cent interest per annum, together with 10 per cent as collection fees on the amount of principal and interest thereof, if sued upon or placed in the hands of an attorney for collection. 3. At the same time, and as a part of the same transaction, F. M. Huddleston contracted in writing with the plaintiff that he would ship and consign to him during the cotton season of 1890-91, extending to February 15, 1891, for sale by him on commission, subject to the customary charges in Galveston, Texas, and commissions to himself for the sale and handling thereof of 2-1 per cent of the amounts of the accounts of sale thereof, one bale of cotton for every $10 loaned, and in default of shipment of said cotton that he would pay plaintiff on February 15, 1891, $1.25 for each bale he so failed to ship, as liquidated damages. A mortgage upon real estate was executed by Huddleston to plaintiff to secure the money loaned, as well as the stipulated damages under the cotton contract, and all other indebtedness which might accrue; and as further security assigned to plaintiff certain collateral promissory notes. Such contracts were customary between cotton factors and their customers. 4. It was shown by the evidence that plaintiff used his capital in connection with his business in making advances to cotton shippers and to pay drafts drawn on cotton, in order to induce shipments of cotton, and not as a money lender; that he gave his personal attention to his business of cotton factor, and had an office, sample rooms, several clerks, and had provided every facility for carrying on his business. 5. F. M. Huddleston, on March 3, 1890, and up to his death, which occurred October 10, 1890, was engaged in a general merchandise business at Alder Branch in Anderson County. It was customary to make advancements and loans to merchants in the interior to assist them in buying bacon, lard, flour, and other goods to advance to the farmers to help them make their crops, especially cotton, consignments of which the plaintiff sought to induce. 6. After the death of Huddleston the notes were sent to plaintiff’s attorney for collection out of his estate. A claim was prepared and presented for the amount of the notes, interest, and attorney fees. No claim was made for the stipulated damages for failure to ship cotton, and no recovery was had therefor. 1. Whether or not the contract was usurious was a question for the determination of the court trying the case without a jury, under all the evidence. Such contracts have been usually upheld by the courts, when fairly made with the purpose of inducing consignments to the factor. Huddles-ton was a country merchant, and by his contract agreed to consign cotton to the plaintiff for sale on commission. The case of Cockle v. Flack, 93 United States, 343, is very similar to this case; and the cases of Norwood v. Faulkner, 53 American Reports, 717; Dozier v. Mitchell, 65 Alabama, 511; and Callaway v. Butler, 7 Southeastern Reporter, 224, are in point, to the effect that such contracts are not usurious when made in good faith for the purpose of inducing shipments of products to factors and commission merchants. There are no conclusions of fact in the record found by the court, but its judgment upon the statement of facts necessarily involves the conclusion that the transaction was not a cover for usurious interest. It has been held by our Supreme Court, that a commission merchant may charge a commission for advances and legal interest thereon; and that such a transaction was not a mere loan for the sake of interest. Mills v. Johnson, 23 Texas, 309, 324. Appellant claims that it was a mere loan made by Kempner to Huddleston. We think that the evidence shows very conclusively that it was a loan or advancement made in connection with the business of plaintiff, for the purpose of promoting the consignment of cotton to him as a cotton factor and commission merchant. 2. The attorney fees stipulated for in the notes were properly allowed by the court, although the maker of the notes had died, because they were placed in the hands of an attorney for collection. Simmons v. Terrell, 75 Texas, 275; Morrill v. Hoyt, 83 Texas 59. 3. It was also proper to allow interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum after maturity, for such were the terms of the contract, and the delay caused by the death of Huddleston would not have the effect to change the tenor of the note. 4. Appellant’s second amended assignment of error is, “ that the court erred in finding against appellant’s exceptions in his supplemental answer to appellee’s first supplemental petition.” Delivered November 3, 1892. The record shows no ruling of the court below on these exceptions, and they will be held to have been waived. There is no error in the judgment of the court below, and it will be affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Williams did not sit in this case.","L. G. Huddleston, Administrator, v. H. Kempner. No. 13. 1. Contract Not Usurious. — K. loaned H. money on notes bearing 10per cent interest to maturity and 12 per cent thereafter, with contract for 10 per cent attorney fees in the event that the note was placed with an attorney for collection ; and at the same time and as a part of the same transaction, H. contracted to ship to K. during the cotton season, for sale on a commission of 2% per cent to K.. one bale of cotton for every $10 loaned, or in default thereof to pay to If. at the end of the season $1.25 for each bale he failed to ship, as liquidated damages. The claim made being only for the amount of the note, and the loan being-made for the purpose of promoting consignments of cotton, held, not usurious. 2. Attorney Fees! — The attorney fees stipulated for in the notes were properly allowed by the court, although the maker of the notes was dead, because they were placed with an attorney for collection. 3. Interest. — It was proper to allow interest at the rate of 12 per cent after maturity as provided for.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Action by the appellee to recover of the appellant H. W. Haley, on a promissory note for $1000, and to foreclose a mortgage given by him on certain machinery and a tract of land to secure the payment of the debt. The defenses were, that the note was given in consideration of the machinery, which plaintiff fraudulently represented to be in a good condition, when in fact it was worn and was in a bad condition, and was almost wholly worthless; and that the consideration had failed; also that the land was the separate property of the wife as well as the homestead of Haley and his family. These last defenses were also set up by the wife in a plea of intervention. The appeal is from a judgment .in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of the note sued on, with foreclosure of the mortgage. Appellants complain of the charge of the court, that the case was withdrawn from the jury. They contend, that the mortgage was executed to secure an antecedent debt, and was upon no valuable consideration, and that evidence was admissible to show that the land was purchased with the separate means of Mrs. Haley, and was her separate property, and that it was not bound by the mortgage; that without pleading on the part of plaintiff, evidence was not admissible to show that he took the mortgage without notice of Mrs. Haley’s separate right in the land. Exceptions were taken to the action of the court in excluding evidence to show that the machinery was worthless, and to prove the value of the improvements put on the land, in order to show notice of the wife’s claim; and in permitting the witness Moore to testify as to the statement made to him by the defendant Haley, that he bought the land for the purpose of executing a mortgage thereon to the plaintiff. Briefly stated, the following are the facts in the case: 1. The execution of the note and mortgage was admitted by the defendants. 2. Defendant first agreed to purchase the machinery, upon which the foreclosure was had, from the plaintiff in the fall of 1885, and afterward executed the note sued on in consideration thereof, and secured the same by the execution of the mortgage on the machinery and the land. 3. When he first talked to plaintiff about buying the machinery, plaintiff told him that it was in good condition, and for defendant to take an expert and go and examine it, which defendant did. He secured the services of one Buford, who was considered an expert in such matters, and made the examination, and Buford told him that he was bit in his trade. Defendant returned to plaintiff and told him the condition in which he and Buford had found the machinery. Plaintiff replied, that it was good machinery; that he had had it examined by a machinist named Warren. Defendant then made the trade, and took possession of the machinery about November 1, 1885, with the understanding that he was to give his note therefor, secured by the mortgage. He had Buford to help him move it. They took it down from where it stood and moved it on to the land afterward mortgaged. 4. The evidence showed that the machinery was in a very bad condition, and that after a great deal of work thereon, defendant finally set it aside and bought new machinery. Defendant did not demand a cancellation of the trade on the ground of fraudulent representation, nor for any other reason. At one time, it was not stated when, he went to the plaintiff and asked him to take the machinery back and sell it and credit him with the proceeds, which plaintiff declined to do; and in the fall of 1889 he offered to return the machinery and pay plaintiff $100 to release him from the note. 5. The note and mortgage sued on were executed April 23, 1886, for the purchase money of the machinery, after the defendant had had it in use since November, 1885. There was not any evidence of fraud on the part of plaintiff in the sale of the machinery to the defendant. 6. It was shown by the evidence, that the separate means of Mrs. Haley were used by her husband to pay for the land which was mortgaged, and which is described in the petition. It was purchased from T. C. Moore, and the deed was executed to the husband, H. W. Haley. Plaintiff had no notice, either actual or constructive, of the equity of Mrs. Haley. 7. The land had not been designated as a homestead, nor used for any of the purposes thereof, when the mortgage was executed, and not until sometime thereafter was it used or occupied as a homestead. 1. The court did not err in its charge to the jury, by which the jury was instructed virtually to return a verdict for the plaintiff, because there was no evidence to sustain the defenses pleaded. The evidence failed to show any fradulent representations by the plaintiff as to the condition of the machinery, or any warranty with respect thereto. 2. It devolved upon the defendant to show that the plaintiff took the mortgage with notice of the equity of Mrs. Haley, and it was not necessary for the plaintiff to so plead; hence it was not error to permit plaintiff to testify, without pleading, that he had no notice of any such equity. 3. As there was no evidence as to any fraudulent representation by the plaintiff with respect to the machinery or its value, there could be no material error., in refusing to allow the witnesses to testify as to its worthless condition. 4. It clearly appeared from the evidence, that the note and mortgage were executed for the purchase of the machinery; consequently it was not error to hold that they were executed upon a valuable consideration, and not without consideration, as upon an antecedent debt; and that plaintiff having taken the security without notice of the equity of Mrs. Haley, it could not be asserted against him. 5. No injury could result from permitting the witness Moore to testify that Haley stated to him when he bought the land that it was for the purpose of mortgaging the same to the plaintiff, because the rights of Mrs. Haley were not in such an attitude as to be prejudiced thereby. Proof of valué of improvements was not admissible for any purpose. The judgment of the court below is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 2, 1893.","FIRST DISTRICT, JANUARY, 1893. H. W. Haley & Wife v. W. W. Manning. No. 69. 1. When Charge May Direct Verdict for Plaintiff.—When suit was on a note given for the purchase money of machinery, and the defense was that the machinery was fraudulently represented by plaintiff to be in good condition, when in fact it was worn and worthless, but the evidence failed to show any fraudulent representations by plaintiff as to the condition of the machinery, or any warranty with respect to it, the jury were correctly instructed virtually to And for plaintiff. 2. Notice of Wife’s Equity in Land Mortgaged by Husband.— The land mortgaged by the husband to secure the note was deeded to him, but paid for with the separate means of the wife. It had not been designated or used as a homestead when the mortgage was executed; it was not error to permit plaintiff to testify that he had no notice of the equity of the wife, without pleading want of notice. Having taken the security without notice of the wife’s equity, it could not be asserted against him. 3. Evidence—Declarations of Husband.—The rights of the wife not being in position to be prejudiced thereby, no injury could result from permitting a witness to testify that the husband said, at the time he bought the land, that he had bought it for the purpose of mortgaging it.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On the 22d day of November, 1886, one S. M. Hutchins filed his application and affidavit in compliance with the regulations adopted by the State Land Board on December 2, 1885, to purchase the land in controversy as agricultural land, under sections 6 and 8 of the Act of 1883. In said application it is stipulated, among other things, as follows: “It is'further understood, that any violation of any of the provisions of the law, or any violation of the rules and regulations of the State Land Board prescribing the manner of purchasing said lands, or a failure to settle upon and improve the land within ninety days from date of award by the board, or any failure to make any of the payments required by law or said regulations, shall work a forfeiture of all money paid on, and all claims to said land, without judicial proceedings. It being understood and agreed that the object of the sale to me is for the purpose of securing a bona fide settler on the land.” Upon this application the land was awarded by the board to Hutchins on December 20,1886. On the 16th day of August, 1887, said Hutchins, joined by his wife, without ever having settled upon the land in compliance with his contract or the law, by deed conveyed all his interest in the land to appellant, Paffrath. Appellant has also failed to settle upon the land. This suit was instituted by the State on August 21, 1890, to recover the land in controversy, alleging the forfeiture by Hutchins and his vendee Paffrath, by reason of their failure to make settlement as required by the law and their contract. Upon the trial of the case in the court below judgment was rendered for appellee, from which this appeal is taken. The only question of importance presented in the brief of appellant is the failure of the court below at Ms request to charge the jury that the State was barred of its right of action by failing to institute this suit within one year, as, it is claimed, is required by section 6 of the law under which this purchase was made. That section of the law is as follows: “Lands when placed upon the market shall be sold in the county or land district in which it is situated, under such authority and under such system of competition as may be prescribed by said Land Board: Provided, that no person, either in person or by agent, shall purchase from the State more than one section of land classed as agricultural land or as watered land, or seven sections of unwatered land: Provided, the board may in their discretion require the purchaser of any particular section of watered pasture land to take with the same such a number of dry sections as they may designate, not to exceed seven sections; and every attempt to evade the limitation of this act as to the amount or class of land one may purchase, by any device whatever, shall be deemed fraudulent, and the fraud may be shown and the purchase cancelled by the State within one year from the date of sale: Provided, that the agricultural lands shall be sold only to actual settlers,” etc. Section 8 provides: “That no sale of agricultural land shall be perfected until the proposed purchaser files an affidavit that he intends that the land shall be actually settled within six months; and in case of failure to settle the same within that time the proposed purchaser shall forfeit the money already paid on the land.” We are of opinion that the limitation prescribed by section 6 does not apply to the case made by this record. The limitation prescribed by that section was intended to fix a time within which fraud perpetrated at the time the contract was entered into could be investigated, and was not intended to have application to a failure on the part of the purchaser to comply with a contract made in good faith at the time it was entered into. If appellant had induced the Land Board to award him agricultural land under a contract for pasture land, or had attempted to purchase more land than he was entitled to under the law, this limitation would apply; but we find no intention disclosed by this statute to relieve a purchaser from the forfeiture declared for a failure to comply with his contract to purchase, the contract itself being valid at the time it was made. The only question submitted by the court in its charge was as to whether or not the purchaser Hutchins had settled on the land within six months after the 20th day of December, 1886; and the jury having found that he had not, we are of opinion that the limitation of one year prescribed by section 6 did not bar the State. Let the j udgment of the court below be in all things affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 17, 1893.","E. A. Paffrath v. The State of Texas. No. 406. State School Land —Failure to Settle — Limitation to Suit for Forfeiture.—Section 6 of the Act of 1883, relating to the sale of State school lands, which limits the amount and class of such lands any one person may purchase, and empowers the State to cancel purchases made in evasion of the act within one year from the date of sale, has no application to the time within which the State may sue to cancel a sale because the purchaser has failed to settle on the land, as further required by section 8 of said act.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This is a suit brought in the District Court of the Thirty-seventh Judicial District of Texas, for and in the County of Bexar, State of Texas, by Mary E. Lambert and others, creditors of Richard S. Lambert, against the appellants, J. Loustaunau and Paul Bergeron, to enjoin the said appellants from executing a certain judgment recovered by the said J. Loustaunau & Co. against Richard S. Lambert for the sum of $2625, and to restrain them from receiving and collecting from the clerk of the court the said sum, which had been realized out of the property and stock of goods of the said Richard S. Lambert, levied upon by the said Loustaunau & Co., under a distress warrant, for rents due and to become due to them from Richard S. Lambert and the appellees herein, as attaching creditors of the said Richard S. Lambert. Upon the filing of the said petition by the appellees herein a temporary injunction was issued, and upon final trial verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of the said appellees and against the appellants, enjoining the appellants from receiving or collecting any of said moneys until appellees’ judgments as creditors of said Richard S. Lambert, amounting to more than the sum of $2625, are first paid, leaving nothing to apply to appellants’ claim and judgment against said Richard S. Lambert for rents due or to become due under said lease; from which judgment the appellants, after the overruling of their motion for a new trial, have appealed. The first assignment of error is as follows: “ The court erred in overruling defendants’ general demurrer to plaintiffs’ petition, because neither said petition nor the first supplemental pétition show any legal or equitable cause of action, in this, that plaintiffs’ said petition shows, that the appellants, J. Loustaunau & Co., were the landlords of Richard S. Lambert, and that the stock of goods owned by the said Lambert and contained in the store house rented from the appellants had been levied upon by execution and distress warrant, and that the proceeds of such goods were in the hands of the clerk of the District Court; and that the said Lambert had rented the store house from appellants under contract executed May 18, A. D. 1889, and to run for three years, beginning October 1, A. D. 1889, and that no part of said rent had been paid except $75, and that the balance due hereon, to-wit, $2625, was a lien upon said stock of goods, and appellants had a right superior to the creditors of Richard S. Lambert to have the same paid out of the proceeds of said stock of goods.” The petition is good as against a general demurrer. It does allege that Loustaunau & Co. had leased the property, and had obtained judgment foreclosing lien upon the goods in the store, and order for the clerk to deliver to them a sufficient amount of the proceeds of the sale to satisfy the judgment; but the petition also shows, that the lease was unexpired— most of the time still to run; that the rent was to be paid $75 monthly in advance; that the plaintiffs were not parties to the judgment, assigning a satisfactory reason for not intervening in the rent suit; setting up their debts, their prior levy; that the sale of the goods was upon order of the court in the attachment suits as well as the rent suit; that defendants had assumed control of the store, and had prevented it being rented, raising the price and doing other acts indicating an abandonment of their rights under the lease. The petition further shows, that Morgan Wilson became the owner of the leasehold estate of the absconding tenant, and so became liable for the unpaid rent, and has been ready and willing, and has tendered to Loustaunau the rent as it became due thereunder for the full term of the lease; “ that Wilson or the said Loustaunau & Co.” leased the premises to one Ben Moke on the 12th day of February, 1890, for the unexpired term for $80 per month, $75 of which was to be paid to Loustaunau & Co.; and if the lease was made by Wilson, it was so made by and with the consent of Loustaunan & Co., they requiring a further sum of $5 per month for rent of their shelving and fixtures in the house, which was a condition precedent to the leasing. It is further alleged, that Loustaunau & Co. did receive the rent from Moke for the premises, $80 per month, up to the first day of March, 1890 (suit filed March 8, 1890); that the defendants have by their acts and conduct waived and released any lien they ever had upon the goods. The supplemental petition, filed October 19,1891, shows that Ben Moke has, from the date of the filing of the original petition, paid defendants $80 per month rent for the premises; that all the rents due under the lease prior to that time have been fully paid; that defendants had accepted Moke as leasee of the premises for the full unexpired term of the Lambert lease, and had thereby released all lien thereunder. We have selected the foregoing allegations from the petition as sufficient grounds for this suit and the relief asked. If Loustaunau & Co. did not waive and relinquish their lien by their interference with the renting of the property to responsible persons, as alleged, by the receipt of rents and by their assumed control of the same before their judgment was rendered, the petitions show that they have done so since. If their rents have been paid up to the time the supplemental petition was filed, and they have accepted Moke as lessee for the remainder of the term, their judgment will be deemed satisfied, and they would have no interest in the funds deposited with the clerk. Their judgment could be satisfied by payment or by part payment and then-acceptance of another lessee for the remainder of the term. We find the material facts in evidence on the trial as follows: On the 18th of May, 1889, Lambert rented the premises in question for three years from Loustaunau & Co., to commence October 1, 1889, at $75 per month, in advance. After paying the first month’s rent, on the 10th of October, 1889, he abandoned the business and absconded. His wife, to whom he was indebted in the amount of $2508, and other creditors, plaintiffs herein, sued him and attached the goods in his store, the suits being brought from the 11th to the 14th of October, 1889, inclusive. On the 1st of November, 1889, Loustaunau & Co. sued out (the October rent having been paid) a distress warrant before a justice of the peace for the rent to become due for the full term of the lease, unpaid from the 1st of November, 1889, to the 1st of October, 1892 — two years and eleven months — and levied on the same goods then in the hands of the sheriff by the levy of the attachments, the distress warrant being made returnable to the next term of the District Court of Bexar County. On the 5th of December, 1889, the landlords filed the proceedings in distress and their petition in the District Court, setting up their rental rights, and on the 12th of December, 1889, they recovered judgment against B. S. Lambert for $2625 rent, with foreclosure of landlord’s lien, and order to clerk to pay the amount out of funds in his hands to them, and the remainder to B. S. Lambert. The creditors, plaintiffs in this suit, applied to the district judge, October 23, 1889, in vacation, for an order to sell the attached goods as perishable property, which order was granted, and the goods ordered sold on the 4th day of November, 1889; and Loustaunau & Co. obtained a similar order for sale to take place on the same day, directing the proceeds to be deposited with the clerk of the court. Under these orders the sale was made to Coulter & Doerr for $3450, who failed to pay the amount of their bid. Thereupon other orders were made to sell the goods (upon application of the parties) on the 9th of December, 1889, which sale was made, and the net proceeds, $2820, deposited with the clerk. Afterwards, as stated, Loustaunau & Co. obtained judgment, foreclosure, and order to the clerk to pay them the amount of their judgment and costs, and the residue to Lambert. This judgment and order were made without the knowledge of the attaching creditors. On the 2nd of November, 1889, Wilson Bros., creditors of Lambert, levied attachment, duly sued out, on the leasehold estate of B. S. Lambert, which, by order of the court in vacation, was sold to Morgan H. Wilson for $105 by the sheriff. On the 11th day of February, 1890, Wilson conveyed, or assigned, the leasehold to Ben Moke, the latter to pay $80 per month rent, in advance, for the unexpired term, the extra $5 over the original $75 being for the fixtures and shelving purchased by Loustaunau & Co., under sheriff’s sale, as the property of Lambert, as alleged in the petition, since which time, to the trial, he has paid the rent to Loustaunau & Co. as it fell due, having also paid to them $40 for half of the month of February, 1890. The sheriff’s deed to Morgan Wilson of the leasehold estate is dated the 11th of February, and Wilson’s deed to Moke is dated February 12, 1890. Wilson’s transfer does not state to whom the rent of $80 per month is to be paid. On the same day of Wilson’s transfer to Moke — the 12th of February, 1890 — J. Loustaunau & Co., by writing, consented to the transfer by Wilson to Moke, and also transferred and conveyed to him all their right, title, and interest to the lease, and warranted the title. On the same day Wilson notified Moke in writing that, for a valuable consideration paid him by Loustaunau & Co., he had assigned rents accrued and to accrue on the lease, and instructed him to pay the same to Loustaunau & Co. On same day Loustaunau & Co. executed receipt to Moke for the $40 rent, as per lease, to 1st of March, 1890. These papers were all delivered to Moke on the same day at the same time. He applied to defendants’ attorney, Bergstrom, to rent the place, understanding that Barnard, Wilson’s attorney, held the lease, and that Loustaunau & Co. were willing it should be rented on the transfer of the lease. Moke says he went to Bergstrom, and he fixed up the rent to suit himself. The evidence justifies the conclusion, and we find, that Loustaunau & Co. assumed to control and manage the renting of the property after their levy; and that after the purchase of the lease by Barnard, attorney for Wilson Bros., for Morgan Wilson, there was' an understanding between them, Loustaunau & Co. and Barnard, that they should be protected, and that their rents should be paid according to the terms of the original lease, and that they were so protected. Barnard, for Wilson, recognized the liability of his client to a full compliance with the terms of the lease, as assignee thereof; and he assumed all the liabilities of Lambert, the original lessee, and Loustaunau & Co. have accepted such liability. It is also fairly inferable from the facts in evidence, that Loustaunau & Co. have been paid, or are at least fully protected, to the time of trial for all rents, and have accepted Moke’s obligation as lessee or assignee of the lease for the rents to accrue, and that if they lose this suit they have accepted obligations of Wilson and Moke for their rent which fully indemnify them. And we so find the facts. All the plaintiffs in this suit recovered judgment against R. S. Lambert, foreclosing their attachment liens on the goods levied on: Mrs. Mary E. Lambert for $2591.60 and costs of suit, on the 10th of March, 1890; Yolger & Gendtner in the sum of $158 and costs of suit, before a justice of the peace; Millie T. Matter, $158.50 and costs, on the 13th of January, 1890; and A. G. C. Matter for $1882.50 and costs of suit, on the 10th of March, 1890. All thé judgments were for just and valid debts and are still unpaid. The proceeds of the-sale of the goods are still in the hands of the clerk. Appellants’ second assignment of error complains of the ruling in admitting the testimony of Morgan H. Wilson, J. Musin, T. H. Coulter, and W. F. Doerr, to the effect that each of them had applied to J. Loustaunau & Co. to rent the house, and that they, Loustaunau & Co., claimed a right therein and attempted to rent the same. Appellants insist that the testimony was immaterial, irrelevant, and prejudicial to them, and1 did not tend to prove that the lease to Richard S. Lambert had been can-celled or abrograted, or show any agreement upon any consideration to release the landlord’s lien upon the goods. One of the issues made by plaintiffs’ pleadings was, that Loustaunau & Co. had by their conduct and acts inconsistent with the lease to Lambert cancelled the same; and another was, that they had in the end accepted Moke, the assignee of the original leasehold, as their lessee, by which they had cancelled the original lease and discharged the goods from their lien. The testimony was admissible upon these issues. All the transactions and acts of Loustaunau & Co. in connection with the rented premises leading to the final result of payment of the accruing rents to them, and accepting Moke as their responsible lessee, were admissible. Any circumstance that would tend to show their relations to the property, or to those to whom the lease had been assigned, was pertinent and relevant. When Wilson became the owner of the lease, he assumed all the obligations of the original lessee, as he was bound by law so to do; and upon the transfer of the lease to Moke, he in turn became so bound; and any fact tending to show that the landlords recognized such substitution was legitimate. Their acceptance of either of them as lessee, or as the party to whom they should look for payment of rent, such party being bound so to do in law or by contract, amounted to a waiver of lien upon the goods of the original tenant. The judgment in their favor would not interfere with their right to do so. Their lien could in this manner be discharged, even though it had been secured by judgment. Harvey v. McGrew, 44 Texas, 412; Howard v. Britton, 71 Texas, 287; Le Gierse v. Green, 61 Texas, 128; Giddings v. Felker, 70 Texas, 176. There was no error in submitting the case to the jury; the issues and the testimony required it, and the evidence supported the verdict. The assignment of error on this point is not well taken. There was evidence tending to establish the proposition that Loustau- . nau & Co. had waived their lien upon the goods in the rented building upon consideration of other persons becoming bound to pay the rent; and there was testimony tending to show; and we find the fact, that the rent due under the original contract had been paid to Loustaunau & Co. for their benefit, or that they were secured in the same up to the time of trial; and therefore the assignment of error objecting to the charge upon the subject can not be sustained. For obvious reasons, before explained, there was no error in refusing to give the fourth special instruction requested by the defendant. It was not applicable to the facts, and did not present the case as made by the testimony. The facts did tend to show that Loustaunau & Co. had abandoned their original lien and accepted other obligations, and had received rent in pursuance of the same. The fifth assignment of error can not be sustained; it objects to the following charge of the court, given by request of plaintiffs: “ Plaintiffs ask the court to charge the jury, that if they find from the evidence that subsequent to the lease by Loustaunau & Co. the said lease was assigned and transferred to one Ben Moke, by and with the consent of said Loustaunau, or by them, and that said lease is for the whole of the unexpired term of the Lambert lease or any part thereof, provided that you find said Ben Moke was accepted by Loustaunau in lieu of Richard S. Lambert’s lease, then you will find for the plaintiffs.” The expression, “ or any part thereof,” should, possibly, not have been used in the charge, because the undisputed evidence shows that the entire unexpired term was assigned to Moke; which, as we have before seen, rendered him liable for the performance of all the undertakings of the original lessee, for rent past due and unpaid as well as that to become due, the acceptance of such obligations by the landlords in legal effect being an acquittance of Lambert and a release of the rental lien upon the goods on the rented premises. The expression noticed, under the facts, could probably mean no more than that part of the term unexpired. Defendants’ requested qualification of the charge, that the mere consent of Loustaunau & Co. to the assignment of the term would not establish their waiver of lien on the goods levied on, was not necessary, and it was objectionable because it was upon the weight of evidence. It is not necessary under the facts to determine whether such consent would be of itself a waiver, because there are other facts and circumstances in evidence justifying the conclusion that Loustaunau & Co. not only consented to the assignment, but accepted the assignee as their lessee, and received payment from him at least from that time down to the time of trial, in payment of their rent. This the court submitted to the jury. Loustaunau and his partner, Bergeron, were not on the stand. Barnard, attorney for Wilson, testified that he was bound as Lambert was bound. The obligation of Moke, who was similarly bound as assignee, got into the hands of Loustaunau & Co., and they have collected the rent from Moke from the time of the assignment to him to the time of trial, Barnard says, as his agent; but the jury could construe the facts to mean that Loustaunau & Co. were collecting the rent on their own account, especially with Barnard’s testimony before them, that if Loustaunau & Co. did not recover in this suit, etc., but if they did recover, he (Barnard), for his client, Wilson, was to have the benefit of the judgment after deducting costs. He says they were his agents in collecting the rents, and they may have been, in the sense that they were to apply the collections of rent to the payment of his obligation, to see that the rents were paid. He testified that he was bound in law as assignee to pay the rents — bound as Lambert was; and it may be supposed that his understanding with Loustaunau was consistent with such liability. Delivered November 2, 1892. His evidence is commendable for candor, and he does not state that the rents when collected were his or his clients. It seems reasonable that Loustaunau & Co. were collecting the rents to pay their claim, for which he acknowledged himself bound. We are satisfied that Loustaunau & Co. are fully protected by Wilson and Moke, whose contracts they have adopted. They should not be allowed to collect their rents twice — once out of the goods and once from the assignee of the lease, who is bound to pay them the rent. They should not be allowed to aid the assignee to avoid his obligation to pay the rent, and profit thereby at the expense of creditors of the original lessee. Having accepted the obligations of Wilson and Moke as lessees and received rents from them, they have waived their judgment lien. The trial below resulted as it should have done, according to the legal and equitable rights of the parties; and there being no reversible error pointed out in the proceedings, the judgment should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed.","J. Loustaunau & Co. v. Mary E. Lambert et al. No. 176. 1. Injunction Against Judgment Enforcing Landlord’s Lien — Pleading. — See allegations held sufficient on general demurrer, in a petition seeking to enjoin a decree foreclosing a landlord’s lien, on alleged satisfaction of the judgment or waiver of the lien on part of plaintiffs in the judgment of foreclosure. 2. Waiver of Landlord’s Lien after Decree of Foreclosure. — The acceptance by a landlord of another tenant as lessee, or as the party to whom the landlord should look for payment, such party being bound so to do in law or by contract, amounts to a waiver of the landlord’s lien for future rents, although after decree enforcing such lien. Circumstantial evidence tending to show such waiver is competent. 3. Immaterial Error in Charge. — Where a charge contains an erroneous clause, hut which could not have influenced the verdict under the testimony, such error is immaterial. See example. 4. Charge Properly Ref used. — On issue of waiver of the lien, a charge was properly refused, that the mere consent of the landlord to the assignment of the term would not establish a waiver of the landlord’s lien, as objectionable because upon weight of evidence. Besides, there was other testimony to such waiver. 5. Satisfaction of Claim for Rent. — A landlord having leased premises for a term of years, and after the failure in business of the lessee, accepting rents that became due thereafter from another, and the obligation of another tenant for the rents to become due for the balance of the term, can not pursue his original lessee upon the lease contract and enforce payment of rents to become due out of the assets of such original lessee upon the premises by distress proceedings.

Latham, 63 Texas, 414. Landlord’s lien attaches to all tenant’s property on premises subject to execution. The acceptance of collateral promise by one who purchases the stock of goods does not of itself release the lien. Amendment of article 3122a, Revised Statutes (Acts of 1889), limiting landlord’s lien to one year, does not affect contracts of lease made before amendment became a law, as that would impair the obligation of a contract.

The purchaser of a lease at execution sale is entitled to the possession of the premises covered by the lease; and an assignment thereof by such purchaser, with the written consent of the lessor, as required by the terms of the lease, did not constitute the acceptance of a new tenant in lieu of the original lessee, nor operate as a cancellation-of the lease nor a waiver of the landlord’s lien on the property of the original lessee.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Appellee Susan II. Morgan and John E. Morgan were married in the State of Missouri in the year 1848, and removed to Parker County, in this State, in 1859, where they resided until the death of said John E. Morgan, in November, 1887. In 1870, however, they ceased to live together as husband and wife, and continued to live separately and apart from each other from that time. In 1876 the said John E. Morgan, after having been refused a divorce in this State, and without ever having become a citizen of Utah Territory, and without ever having acquired a domicile therein, obtained a decree of divorce from his said wife, in the Probate Court of Salt Lake County. In said last named suit for divorce the said Susan H. Morgan filed a plea to the jurisdiction of said court, she being at the time a citizen of this State, and never at any time having been in, or acquired a domicile in, said Utah Territory. After having obtained the Utah divorce as above set forth, in the fall of 1876 the said John E. Morgan and appellant, Laura F. Morgan, were married in Tarrant County in this State. At the time of this last marriage the said John E. Morgan owned 160 acres of land, which is a part of the property in controversy herein, and after such marriage he and appellant accumulated the remainder of the property in controversy, or at least a large part thereof. The cause was submitted in the court below to the jury upon special issues, and upon their verdict judgment was rendered declaring the Utah divorce to be a nullity, and adjudging all the property in controversy to the lawful wife, Susan H. Morgan, and appellee W. B. Morgan, who was the only child of said John E., and from this judgment this appeal is prosecuted. Appellant’s seventh assignment of error calls in question the action of the court in admitting evidence as to the actual residence of J. E. Morgan in this State, for the purpose of attacking the decree of divorce rendered in Utah, the contention being that the judgment of a sister State or Territory can not be attacked collaterally. That such judgment can be collaterally attacked in this State by showing that the court which rendered it was without jurisdiction, is too well settled to require discussion. Chunn v. Gray, 51 Texas, 114; Redus v. Burnett, 59 Texas, 581; Norwood v. Cobb, 24 Texas, 554. We are also of opinion that the court did not err in holding the Utah divorce to be an absolute nullity. The verdict of the jury established that John E. Morgan was never at any time a citizen of Utah Territory, and never at any time, either before or after the granting of the decree, acquired a domicile therein. Without undertaking to discuss the reasons upon which the decisions are based, we think it will be found that an almost unbroken line of decisions in the different States establishes the invalidity of a decree of divorce where neither of the parties are domiciled in the country granting the decree. 2 Black on Judg., 927; 2 Freem. on Judg., 580. The court below, proceeding upon the idea that if the Utah divorce was a nullity the second marriage of John E. Morgan would also be a nullity, and would deprive the appellant, Laura F. Morgan, of all interest in the property acquired while she was living with him under such marriage, refused to admit evidence that the said Laura F. entered into this marriage in good faith, believing that the said John E. Morgan had been legally divorced from his former wife; and also refused evidence that the said Laura F., by her prudent management and services, contributed to the acquisition of the property in question, believing herself to be a lawful wife; and in entering its decree adjudged that she was not entitled to any part of such property; and the correctness of this action of the court presents the most serious question for our consideration. The status of property acquired by a man and woman living together as husband and wife without having been lawfully married has been the subject of doubt and litigation almost from the time Texas became an independent republic. At an early day it was settled that where a headlight certificate was issued to a man thus situated, as the head of a family, the woman was entitled to a one-half interest therein, notwithstanding the man had a lawful wife and family in another State, and the woman knew this fact. In other words, the fact that the woman was living in open adultery with the man did not deprive her of the right to claim a community interest in the certificate granted in his name or to his heirs. Babb v. Carroll, 21 Texas, 766; Lewis v. Ames, 44 Texas, 345; Yates v. Houston, 3 Texas, 433. But the direct question involved in this controversy, so far as we are aware, has never been authoritatively settled in this State, although frequent allusions have been made to it. In Carroll v. Carroll, 20 Texas, 743, Chief Justice Hemphill uses this language: “ I have not considered the strong claim which the defendant, Susan, independently of her rights as a lawful wife, might have urged to a community share of the property. She was his wife de facto. -By her labors and toils she contributed to the accumulation of, the estate. At the time of their marriage they were in a state of indigence, their property not amounting to more than $150. Their gains were the result of their joint industry, thrift, and economy, and she is reasonably entitled to a share of the proceeds.” In Zimpelman v. Robb, 53 Texas, 283, the question was alluded to as not being necessary to be decided. In Routh v. Routh, 57 Texas, 600, in the opinion adopted by the court the question is expressly waived as not being necessary for its decision, but in the separate opinion of Associate Justice Bonner, on page 602, he uses the following language: “ I am of the opinion that under the facts and circumstances of this case Nancy Thompson, in right of her putative marriage with Jonathan Routh, was entitled to one-half of the property acquired during that marriage, in the nature of a partnership of acquests and gains. I am am further of the opinion, that only the remainder of the property of that marriage, or one-half of the whole, could constitute the net community property of Jonathan Routh and his legal wife, Elizabeth Routh, plaintiff below, and that all to which the latter should in any event be entitled would be one-fourth the whole or one-half the net community property of herself and Jonathan Routh:” and cites Clendenning v. Clendenning, 3 La. (N. S.), 438; Succession of Navarro, 24 La. Ann., 297; Harrington v. Barfield, 30 La. Ann., part 2, 1297; Gaines v. Hennen, 24 How., 553; Gaines v. New Orleans, 6 Wall., 642; Smith v. Smith, 1 Texas, 621; Lee v. Smith, 18 Texas, 141; Henderson v. Ryan, 27 Texas, 670. It will thus be seen that the strong tendency of our judges in the past has been to hold that property acquired in this State, under our community laws, by a man and woman living together as husband and wife, should belong to them in equal shares, whether they were legally married or not. And why should this not be so, especially when they have attempted to enter into a marriage contract, and believed that they were lawfully husband and wife ? In such cases, by attempting to enter into the marriage contract, they agreed, as far as they had the power to agree, that they would live together as husband and wife, and that all property that they might thereafter acquire should be community property, and belong to them in equal portions. Such is the meaning of the contract they attempted to make under our law. How, then, can it be said that the property acquired in pursuance of such a contract shall belong to one of the parties more than the other ? What right has the husband to all of the property, to the exclusion of the wife, or what right has the wife to all of the property, to the exclusion of the husband ? Suppose a wife so situated should by her own exertions acquire property toward which the husband did not contribute anything, would it be contended that this property became his property? How, then, can it be that where the property is acquired by the joint labors of both, each in the eye of the law contributing one-half thereto, it shall belong only to the husband ? It will not do to refer to the decisions in common law States to sustain the proposition that the woman under such circumstances has no right to any part of the property so acquired. In those States, by entering into the marriage contract she understood that all the property they might acquire while living together should belong to the husband, but in this State she understood that their rights in the property they might accumulate should be equal. If it be .undertaken to sustain the view that the husband is entitled to everything, upon the ground that he has possession, or that the titles have been taken in his name, and that under the circumstances indicated the courts will not lend their aid to either party, but will leave them where it finds them in reference to their property rights, then why should the court lend its aid to recover from appellant the property alleged to be in her possession, especially the personal property ? If we undertake to apply to the parties in this case the principles of law applicable to persons engaged in an illegal contract, it would seem that under the decisions in this State, the appellant, Laura F. Morgan, would be entitled to one-half of the property made by the partnership of which she and John E. Morgan were the members. By the decision in De Leon v. Trevino, 49 Texas, 92, approved in Pfeuffer v. Maltby, 54 Texas, 461, and in Wegner Bros. v. Biering & Co., 65 Texas, 511, it seems to be established as the law of this State, that although the partnership may be engaged in an illegal traffic, yet when the contract has been executed without the aid of the court by the voluntary acts of the parties, the profit that is realized is not contaminated, and the partners can force a division thereof; and this seems also to be the view entertained by the Supreme Court of the United States. Brooks v. Martin, 2 Wall., 70; Bank v. Bank, 16 Wall., 483; McBlair v. Gibbs, 17 How., 232. Applying these principles to the case at bar, if it be conceded that the relations of John E. Morgan and appellant were illegal, and that their contract to live together and divide the property they might accumulate would not sustain an action in behalf of either if brought thereon, still we believe it can not be said that after the contract has been voluntarily executed by both, and the property has been acquired, the courts will refuse to recognize their respective interests therein. But the evidence excluded by the court, if admitted, would have made a stronger case than the one we have considered. Appellant proposed to prove that she entered into the marriage contract with John E. Morgan in good faith, believing he had a legal divorce from his former wife, he having represented to her that this was the case. Her mistake then was one of fact. But even if it had been shown that she was apprised of all the circumstances of the divorce, while she may have been charged with a knowledge of the law that would render it a nullity, yet her mistake was one that almost any person not versed in the law would be liable to make. The court in Utah had declared it to be a legal divorce, and appellant, without any great degree of negligence, might have accepted this as conclusive, especially when its legality depended upon the ascertainment of facts, which it was the duty of the court to ascertain before granting the decree. We are of the opinion, therefore, that if appellant in good faith believed that she was the lawful wife of John E. Morgan, she should not be deprived of her right to participate in the property acquired through their joint efforts, and that she should have been allowed to prove that fact, and that this issue should have been submitted to the jury. Delivered November 15, 1892. Of course this would give appellant no right to any share in the prop-, erty which John E. Morgan had at the time of his attempted marriage to her, whether such property be his separate property or the community property of him and his first wife. This by our statute would go to his lawful wife and child. Newland v. Holland, 45 Texas, 588. We are therefore relieved of the necessity of discussing the effect of the separation contract attempted to be entered into between John E. Morgan and his wife Susan H. Morgan. Should this become necessary in the further progress of this litigation, the law applicable to such contracts will be found very fully considered in Rains v. Wheeler, 76 Texas, 394; also alluded to in James v. James, 81 Texas, 378. The action of the court in submitting this case upon special issues we think in compliance with our statutes (1 Sayles’ Civil Statutes, art. 1333), and appellant’s assignments of error challenging this practice are not well taken. The description of the property and the answers of the jury to the special issues are so indefinite, and the changes that have occurred in the property since the trial of this cause in the court below are probably so extensive, that we think it is best to reverse and remand the cause for a new trial in accordance with this opinion, rather than to undertake to render here such judgment as the court below ought to have rendered; and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded.","Laura F. Morgan v. Susan H. Morgan et al. No. 26. 1.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. The controlling question in this case arises upon the admission of paroi testimony to add to, and hence vary, one or more written instruments; it being contended by appellee that the testimony admitted came within the exceptions to the general rule on that subject. The written agreement between the parties, executed on the 25th day of May, 1886, omitting description of the property, reads as follows: “State of Texas, County of Wilbarger.—This agreement, made and entered into this day by and between P. J. Willis & Bro., of Galveston, Texas, of the first part, and Mrs. M. A. Byars, of Vernon, Texas, of the second part, witnesseth: “ That the party of the first part agreed not to defend case number 44, M. A. Byars v. P. J. Willis & Bro., in the District Court of Wilbarger County, Texas, but to allow the injunction asked therein to be made perpetual, upon the party of the second part paying all costs in said case which shall be adjudged against her. “And said parties of the first part further agree to release and quitclaim to the said party of the second part all their right, title, and interest and claim in and to lots numbers 11,12,13, 14, and 15, in block number 31, now occupied as a homestead by party of the second part. In consideration of all which said party of the second part agrees to release and quitclaim to said parties of the first part all her right, title., and claim in and to the following lots and parcels of land in the town of Vernon, Wilbarger County, Texas. * * * “All said property being and lying in said town of Vernon, and the additions thereto, in Wilbarger County, Texas. “And the said party of the second part further agrees to dismiss case number 78, M. A. Byars v. P. J. Willis & Bro., and number 81’, M. A. Byars v. P. J. Willis & Bro., on the District Court docket in Wilbarger County, Texas, and to pay all costs in said two cases. And it is further agreed, in consideration of the above quitclaim deed, to be executed, by the said party of the first part, that the said party of the second part further release all claims for damages against the said party of the first part by reason of the suits, judgments, levies heretofore made and instituted by the said P. J. Willis & Bro. against C. M. Byars and herself. Witness our hands, this 25th day of May, 1886. “ Witnesses: M. A. Byars, “ Henry Finch, P. J. Willis & Bro., “Dave McBride. Per Geo. Diehl. Agent.” In accordance with this agreement, there was executed by appellee, contemporaneously therewith, a quitclaim deed to appellants to certain lots of land therein set out, for the recited consideration of 81 and a release and quitclaim to certain other lots of land therein set out, executed by appellants to appellee. This deed contained the further recital that, “my husband, C. M. Byars, having left and abandoned me, and now being absent from the State, having been away for months, I make this quitclaim and release as the remaining manager of the community property, and to further protect its interest.” In other respects, it was a quitclaim deed in the usual form, reciting only the considerations above specified. The contention of appellee was that these writings did not contain the full contract; and she offered and was permitted, over the objection of appellants, to prove orally, that in addition to the matters settled and agreed upon, as shown by these writings, it was further agreed by appellant’s agent, George Diehl, that a certain judgment which had been recovered in 1883 by appellants against C. M. Byars, in the District Court of Galveston County for over $4000, should also be considered settled on that day and by the agreement then entered into, and that thereafter said Diehl would mark the same satisfied on the record of said suit in Galveston County. Appellants objected to the introduction of this evidence as being violative of the rule which excludes oral testimony where it has the effect of varying a contemporaneous written instrument. Appellee alleged, that either through mistake or fraud, this part of the-agreement was not specified in the written instruments above set out. The testimony, however, does not seem to have been admitted upon this ground; and the court in the charge did not submit that issue to the-jury, but instructed them that if at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed from M. A. Byars to plaintiffs below, it was understood and agreed by both deféndant and plaintiff’s agent, George Diehl, that the deed should be accepted by plaintiffs in full satisfaction and payment of said judgment, and that said Diehl had authority to settle said judgment, that they should find in favor of appellee upon that issue. This charge is also complained of by appellants. The first contention of appellee, in support of the action of the court, is, “Where written instruments form a part of""a more comprehensive transaction, the terms of which are not attempted to be expressed in writing, paroi evidence as to such parts of the transaction as were not reduced, to writing is admissible;” citing the case of Thomas v. Hammond, 47 Texas, 54, and other cases. These cases announce the correct rule where no attempt is made to reduce the more comprehensive agreement to writing. That, in our opinion, is not this case. Here the parties undertook with care to reduce to writing an agreement comprehending several different transactions. The agreement on its face appears to be complete. As to whether there was- or was not at the time, as a part of the settlement, an additional verbal agreement to satisfy the original judgment, the statements of the witnesses-for appellants and appellee were in sharp contradiction. To prevent such a result is evidently one of the objects of the rule which holds the writing to contain the entire agreement where on its face it appears to be, though not in fact, complete, and it is not shown that this appearance of completeness results from fraud, accident, or mistake. Belcher v. Mulhall & Scaling, 57 Texas, 18, and cases there cited. Appellee’s second contention is, that paroi evidence was admissible to-show that the consideration for the quitclaim deed executed by appellee was not fully expressed; but that, in addition to the considerations named, it was agreed that the judgment in question should be satisfied. This proposition seems to have been decided against appellee by us at a former day of this term in the following cases: Weaver v. The City of Gainesville (1 Texas Civil Appeals, 286), and Rubrecht v. Powers (Id., 282). Our construction of the written instruments executed as above set forth, and constituting one transaction, leads to the conclusion that oral testimony to incorporate as a part thereof the agreement to satisfy the Galveston judgment was erroneous and necessitates a reversal of the judgment. We are, however, of the opinion that the court did not err in refusing to strike out appellee’s plea in reconvention. The questions raised by the other assignments of error are not likely to arise upon another trial, and hence need not be considered. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This appeal is prosecuted by the appellant from a judgment rendered by the County Court of Parker County in favor of appellees in the sum of 8561.12. The judgment was for damages found by the court to have resulted from a failure to deliver a telegraphic message delivered to the agent of the company at Albany, Texas, to be transmitted to Weatherford, Texas. We find from the record the following conclusions of fact: 1. On and before June 21, 1889, the appellees constituted a firm composed of J. M. Haman, J. E. Dunbaugh, and R. W. Ellis, engaged at Weatherford, Texas, in the business of buying and selling wool. 2. On Friday, June 21, 1889, J. E. Dunbaugh was at Albany, in Shackelford County, for the purpose of purchasing wool for his firm. Finding a quantity of wool for sale, he telegraphed his house through defendant as follows: “June 21, 1889. “J. M. Haman & Co., Weatherford, Texas: “ Can buy some light bright medium at nineteen. Best can do. If can not buy will come home. Answer quick. “J. E. Dunbaugh.” To this telegram he received the following reply: “ Weatherford, Texas, June 21, 1889. “J"". E. Dunbaugh, Albany, Texas: “ If not over 10,000 pounds and twelve months, buy it and come home. “J. M. Haman & Co.” 3. Thereupon Dunbaugh purchased of one E. A. Rose 14,444 pounds of wool, for 13,444 pounds of which he paid 18-J- cents per pound. The remainder was of inferior quality. After this purchase he delivered to the defendant’s agent at Albany for transmission the following dispatch: “Albany, Texas, June 21, 1889. “J"". M. Haman & Go., Weatherford, Texas: “ Bought seventy-six sacks, fourteen thousand, one thousand off One-third, eighteen and a half. All light wools. Twelve months. Be home Sunday, “J. E. Dunbaugh.” 4. Dunbaugh delivered this message to the agent about 7 o’clock p. m. June 21, 1889, paying the price of the message, 55 cents. He told the agent that it would be in time if sent next morning. He also informed him that the message was important; that he expected his house had probably sold the wool, meaning that his house had probably contracted the sale of it. To be certain that no mistake should be made, Dunbaugh, having written the message, had the agent to transcribe it and himself signed the copy. 5. The defendant did not transmit the message, nor did it on the trial offer to show any excuse whatever for failing to send it. The members of the firm at Weatherford were not informed of the purchase until the arrival of Dunbaugh on June 25. 6. Thirteen thousand four hundred and forty-four pounds of this wool were, on June 21 and June 22, 1889, worth in the market 21 cents per pound. On June 25, 1889, when the firm at Weatherford were first informed of the purchase of the wool, the price had declined. Immediately on receiving the information that the dispatch had not been received, plaintiffs wrote and wired with great diligence to secure a purchaser for the wool. They could not find a purchaser willing to pay more than 14 cents per pound. The wool at the trial remained unsold. 7. Had the dispatch been received on June 22, the plaintiffs could and would have sold the wool at 21 cents per pound. The facts embodied in the foregoing conclusions would have justified the court, on the application to them of a proper rule for the measure of damages, in awarding to the plaintiffs a greater sum than that included in the judgment. The circumstances surrounding the delivery of the telegram were sufficient to apprise the company, through its agent, of the importance of the message and of the consequences of a failure to deliver it. The loss sustained by the plaintiffs, exceeding under the facts the amount of the judgment, must be held to have been within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the delivery of the message for transmission. The appellant can not complain that the loss of a sale contemplated by the plaintiffs, resulting as it did from the failure to transmit the message, should be measured by the difference “ between the market value of the wool at the time the message should have been delivered and at a reasonable time after the omission to transmit had been discovered.” 2 Sedg. on Dam., sec. 683. It follows that the court committed no material error in overruling the special exception to plaintiffs’ petition, which exception was to the effect, that the damages sought to be recovered were too “remote, uncertain, and contingent.” The facts stated in our conclusions were amply covered by the averments of the plaintiffs’ petition. The court did not err in sustaining the motion to suppress the interrogatories propounded to the plaintiffs and the answers thereto. These answers were taken by the officer without the issuance of a commission authorizing them. Eev. Stats., art. 2239-2241. Nor did the court err in overruling the application, on the ground of newly discovered evidence, praying for a new trial. The plaintiffs, or one of them, had testified that had the message in question been duly delivered, Haman & Co. would have sold the wool to one Loupheimer. The purported newly discovered evidence consisted in a statement by Loupheimer, which defendant expected to procure, contradicting this testimony of plaintiffs. No affidavit by Loupheimer, however, that he would make a statement of such a character was attached to the application. As & substitute for such affidavit, the defendant attached to the application a telegram from one of its employes, that he had interviewed Loupheimer, and that the latter had communicated to him certain facts stated in the telegram and indicating that the testimony of the plaintiffs was untrue. This was manifestly insufficient. The judgment is therefore affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 3, 1893.","The Western Union Telegraph Company v. J. M. Haman & Co. No. 954. 1.

Held, that the damages thus sustained were within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the contract to deliver the message, and that defendant can not complain of a verdict for a less amount than the actual loss suffered by plaintiffs. 3. Evidence—Deposition Suppressed, When.—Where interrogatories were propounded to a party to the suit and his answers thereto taken without the issuance of a commission, such deposition was, on motion, properly suppressed. 4. New Trial — Newly Discovered Evidence. — An application for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence of a witness, is properly overruled where it is not accompanied by the affidavit of the witness to the effect that he will testify to the facts stated in the application. Appeal from County Court of Parker. Tried below before Hon. I. N. Roach. B. G. Bidwell, for appellant. 1. The damages sought to be recovered are too remote, uncertain, and contingent. They are not the natural results of the negligence complained of, nor such as were within the contemplation of the parties at the time the message was delivered to appellant. Daniel v. Tel. Co., 61 Texas, 452; Tel. Co. Sheffield, 71 Texas, 570; Tel. Co. v. Brown, 71 Texas, 723; Tel. Co. v. Kirkpatrick, 76 Texas, 217; Tel. Co. v. Smith, 76 Texas, 253; 2 Willson’s C. C., secs. 113, 644. 2. The facts show that there was no notice given the telegraph company of any pecuniary value of the message. It was therefore not proper for the court to render judgment against the company, because the damages shown are not the natural and proximate result of negligence complained of. 23 Am. Law Reg., 287; 24 Am. Law Reg., 336; 17 Am. Rep., 425; Gray on Tel., arts. 82-87; 124 U. S., 444; 132 U. S., 125; 31 Fed. Rep., 134; Sedg. on Dam., 108, 112. George A. McCall, for appellees. 1. The damages sought to be recovered are the natural results of the admitted negligence of the defendants, or are such as might reasonably be supposed to have been in contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract as to the probable results of a breach of it. 3 Willson’s C. C., sec. 645; Rittenhouse v. Tel. Co., 4 Am. Rep., 623; Caudle v. Tel. Co., 17 Am. Rep., 460; Daugherty v. Tel. Co., 61 Am. Rep., 436; Broesch v. Broesch, 72 Texas, 659; Loper v. Tel. Co., 70 Texas, 692. 2. The nature of the dispatches show that the wool was bought to sell, and that it was important that the firm be promptly advised, and that the message had a pecuniary value. Plaintiffs sue to recover an actual loss, not profits. Manville v. Tel. Co., 18 Am. Rep., 8; Thompson v. Tel. Co., 54 Am. Rep., 644; Griffin v. Calvin, 16 N. Y., 489."
"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Action to recover damages for personal injuries, brought in the District Court of Jefferson County, October 28, 1890, by the defendant in error against the plaintiff in error, received while in the employment of the defendant as fireman on an engine, and which were alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the plaintiff in error in its failure to keep in repair the attachments and fastenings which held the engine and tender together, by reason whereof, while plaintiff was engaged in the discharge of his duty on said engine and tender, they suddenly became detached from each other, and plaintiff was thrown down between them and seriously injured. Defendant pleaded general denial, not guilty, and a special plea of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. Trial was had by jury, November 27, 1890, and verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of the plaintiff for $30,000. The errors assigned relate to the giving and refusing of instructions to the jury, and that the verdict of the jury is unsupported by the evidence and is excessive in amount. The second and ninth assignments of error are grouped by the plaintiff in error in its brief, and present the second section of the charge of the' court, which is complained of as erroneous and defective, and a special charge requested by the defendant in order to correct the same. This is objected to by the defendant in error as in violation of the rules. We think it a proper practice, in the preparation of briefs, for the appellant or plaintiff, in error to group such assignments, and that it is to be commended rather than objected to, where they present the same question, as in the case of a defective charge with the special instruction requested to correct the same. But the court is not required to select one of the several charges asked as an entirety and give it, when the others are not applicable or called for by the facts of the case, or because the court has already fully instructed the jury on the question. Brownson v. Scanlan, 59 Texas, 222. The special instructions requested by the defendant were several paragraphs, apparently written one after the other, and relating to different phases of the case, without being separated, except that they are numbered; but in view of the disposition we shall make of the case, we deem it proper to notice some of the special instructions requested by the defendant. The section of the charge complained of is as follows: “ The defendant pleads the general denial, which has the legal effect to throw upon plaintiff the burden of showing by the evidence to your satisfaction, that he has been damaged substantially as alleged, and that such damage was caused, as alleged by liim, by a defect in the appliances used as a coupling, or to which the coupling of the engine was attached, and that such defect was known, or by the exercise of proper care on the part of the defendant or those employes of defendant whose duty it was to inspect and ascertain such defect, might have been known; and the measure or amount of damages that the plaintiff had sustained, if any, so as that you may with reasonable certainty assess the same by your verdict, before the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.” And the special instruction requested was: “ If you believe from the evidence in this case that plaintiff, Ewing, knew, or by the exercise of ordinary care and prudence might have known, of any old crack, if any, in the casting which coupled the tender, or tank, to the engine, and believe from the evidence that he continued afterward to pursue, and was at the time of such injuries pursuing, his employment in the use of said tender and engine, then, although you may believe such old crack existed therein, and that it was the cause of his injury, he can not in such case recover of defendant; and if you so believe, you will find for defendant.” There was no error in the charge given, for it correctly stated what the plaintiff was required to show. If, in connection with the evidence as developed on the trial, it should appear that the injuries were received by the fault or negligence of the plaintiff, then he would not be entitled to recover, and this was presented in a subsequent portion of the charge. The requested instruction, while in the abstract correct, would probably have misled the jury as to the care required of the plaintiff, when taken in connection with that required of the defendant to furnish machinery and appliances that were reasonably safe, because the plaintiff would not be charged with the duty of inspecting the coupling for latent defects. Railway v. Crenshaw, 71 Texas, 346. Without setting out the third paragraph of the charge of the court, which is complained of as erroneous, and the special instructions requested in connection therewith, we are of the opinion that the charge given was perhaps misleading to the jury with respect to the duty of the defendant to furnish reasonably safe machinery and appliances; and that the third special instruction requested by the defendant should have been given, as it very correctly states the duty with which the defendant and plaintiff were respectively charged. Railway v. Crenshaw, 71 Texas, 346. We do not think that the evidence called for the fourth special instruction, to the effect that if the company was not chargeable with negligence under the evidence, but that the engineer was negligent, and his negligence caused the injury, then the engineer, being the fellow servant of the plaintiff, the jury should find for the defendant; because whatever negligence there may have been shown on the part of the engineer was the failure to inspect the engine and see that the coupling was in a safe condition; and as this was the duty of the defendant, the failure of the engineer to properly inspect would be the negligence of the defendant and not of the engineer, a fellow servant. The judgment in this case is for the sum of $30,000, and it is complained of as being excessive. Plaintiff’s injuries were shown to have been very severe. Dr. Calhoun, his physician, testified: “ He was pretty badly wounded. He had a wound on the side of his neck, one behind his ear, one on each ear, and another wound on his shoulder, and his jaw was broken. His eyes were crossed pretty badly. His wound on his shoulder is permanent, and the one behind the ear may become permanent; the bone was exposed a good deal. That bone, possibly, in the course of time, may become dead. A portion of the shoulder-blade was exposed, and a portion of that bone is dead. It will finally cause the wound to run. He will never have good use of his arm, and probably he will be troubled a great deal with his shoulder unless he has an operation performed on it. It cari be operated on and probably healed permanently. I think he has lost the use of his arm for life. The bone was injured where the collar bone and shoulder come together, and that weakens the muscles of the arm. His jaw was fractured in the lower part, and two teeth were pressed upwards and one was finally pulled out. By an operation his shoulder may be permanently healed and prevented from running. He can never be given the arm back again. It may be healed up if the bone is not too much diseased. It may be more diseased than I think. He may possibly use it for writing.” Witness testified as to the cost of an operation on the shoulder, that it would perhaps be $200, and stated that he was fully assured that the bone would not heal without an operation. Plaintiff was 24 years old and stout and healthy at the time he was injured, and a strong man. His wages were from $2.10 to $2.25 a day. With respect to his injuries, he said: “I was knocked insensible and did not know anything for about four and a half days, and when I came .to my right mind I had a hole cut in the side of my neck and back of my shoulders, and the top of my ear was gone, and there was a hole knocked in the side of my head just behind my ear; one jaw was broken. I was knocked cross-eyed and am deaf in one ear. I am now unable to use my right arm. The wound in my shoulder is not well yet; it is still running. The doctor got bones out of me. I had a box full taken out here in Beaumont, and when I went to the hospital they took out a double hand-full. My jaw was broken. My shoulder-blade came through the skin at first.” He was confined to his bed about eight weeks before he could sit up any length of time. His wounds still hurt him, and he suffered considerably in mind and body. It was four months or more before he was able to walk around alone. He was in such condition that he could do no work. Delivered December 8, 1892. We are of the opinion that the judgment is excessive in amount. While the injuries were very severe and the damage great, still the amount is very large, and can not be sustained by any rule of computation. It is not necessary to notice any of the remaining assignments of error. Because the judgment of the court below is excessive, it will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","Sabine & East Texas Railway Company v. R. W. Ewing. No. 48. 1. Preparation of Briefs. — We think it a proper practice, in the preparation of briefs, for the appellant or plaintiff in error to group such assignments as""present the same question, as in the case of a defective charge, with the special instructions requested to correct the same; and that such practice is to be commended rather than objected to as in violation of the rules. 2. Preparation of Charges Asked. — The special charges asked by defendant were two different phases of the case without being separated, except that they are numbered. Held, the trial court is not required to select one of several charges asked as an entirety and give it, when others are not applicable or called for by the facts of the case, or when the jury has already been fully instructed on the question. 3. Charges on Known Defects Properly Refused. — The plaintiff, a fireman, was injured by the parting of the engine from the tender. The charge given by the court below correctly stated what plaintiff was required to show, in order to entitle him to a recovery. The jury was also told, that if it should appear from the evidence that the injuries were received in consequence of the fault or negligence of the plaintiff, then he could not recover. A requested charge was, in substance, that if the plaintiff knew, or by the exercise of ordinary care might have known, of any old crack, if any, in the casting which coupled the tender to the engine, and he continued in his employment, and in the use of said tender and engine, that he could not recover. While in the abstract correct, this charge might have misled the jury as to the care required of the plaintiff, when taken in connection with the duty of the defendant to furnish reasonably safe machinery; because plaintiff was not charged with the duty of inspecting the coupling for latent defects. 4. Safe Machinery — Charges.—See statement of case for a charge given, held to be erroneous, and a charge refused, held to be correct. 5. Fellow Servant. — The negl.genoe which may have been shown on the part of the engineer, was the failure to inspect the engine and see that the coupling was in safe condition; and as this was the duty of the defendant, the failure of the engineer to properly inspect would be the negligence of the defendant, and not of a fellow servant; and a charge upon nonliability of the company because of negligence of a fellow servant was not called for. 6. Excessive Verdict. — See facts upon which a verdict for $30,000 for personal injuries was held to be excessive, because not to be sustained by any rule of computation. Error from Jefferson. Tried below before Hon. W. H. Ford. The third charge given and third charge requested were as follows: “3. It is the duty of every railway company to furnish and keep in good repair and in safe repair and condition engines and machinery, such as couplings, and every part of the apparatus and fixtures attached to their cars and engines necessary for the transaction of their business and the operation of their engines and trains; and the degree of diligence which should be used in doing this should be proportioned to the degree of hazard or danger which may reasonably be anticipated as consequent upon its neglect, considering the work to be done; and if the defendant used such care and diligence in furnishing and keeping in good repair and in safe condition the alleged defective machinery complained of by plaintiff as causing his injuries, it would not have been guilty of such negligence as would render it liable for damages for the injuries to plaintiff as its employe.” “3. The defendant railway company was not required by law to insure the plaintiff against hurts or injuries from defective machinery, but only to use reasonable care in selecting and furnishing to him and other employes implements and appliances for the performance of their duties, and to see that they were safe and appropriate in so far as it could do by the exercise of such care as ordinarily prudent persons would employ in such matters, considered with reference to the risks to be incurred in such matters, and reasonably proportioned to such risks. And defendant would in no case be, by the law, held liable for injuries resulting from such defects in such machinery or appliances as were concealed, or of which the company or its agents charged with the duty of selecting and furnishing said machinery did not know of, and could not have known of in the exercise of the care above explained; and if you believe from the evidence, that the defendant company or such agent had exercised such care, and did not know of such defects, if any, as alleged in plaintiff’s petition, then you will find for defendant; for in such case defendant company would not be responsible for plaintiff’s injuries, if any were received as alleged; the said Ewing having, in entering the service of defendant, assumed all risks to himself from his employment, except those which flow from the negligence of his employer in the failure to perform its duty as herein before defined.” O’Brien & O’Brien, for plaintiff in error. 1.

It being the duty of the defendant to use ordinary care to furnish safe and suitable machinery to its operatives performing services for it, the plaintiff had the legal right to presume it had performed said duty. And the court having charged that the plaintiff must show that the injuries occurred ‘ ‘ without fault or negligence’ ’ on his part, after properly defining negligence, was not required to go further in that direction.

In actions for personal injury, and in cases generally where there is no fixed rule of. compensation, the theory of the law is that the decision of the jury is conclusive, unless they have been misled, or their verdict has been influenced by corruption, passion, or prejudice; and there being no claim of prejudice, passion, or corruption in this case, and the lower court having approved the verdict, there is nothing to authorize a reversal on the ground of the verdict being excessive.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. J. Y. and B. E. Procter, doing business as retail merchants under the firm name of Procter Bros., in the town of Hillsboro, made a transfer of their entire stock of goods under circumstances which gave rise to this lawsuit. On the 1st day of February, 1887, J. Y. Procter sold to his partner his interest in the business in consideration of $75, secured by the promissory note of B. E. Procter, and the assumption on the part of the latter of the debts of the firm. Thereafter, on the 4th day of said month, B. E. Procter sold and delivered the entire stock of goods, valued at $6685.12, to appellant, the Blankenship & Blake Co., in settlement of a debt owed by said firm to appellant of $6535.49, and for the further consideration that appellant would pay to J. V. Procter the $75 note and a debt of $33 owed by said firm for clerk hire, which sums appellant did afterwards pay. The transaction was accomplished by appellant through its agent, Owen Burnett. Thereafter, on the 7th day of February, appellees, P. J. Willis & Bro., who were also creditors of said firm, seized under attachment a portion of said stock of goods, which were claimed by appellant under the statute for the trial of the right of property; and from a verdict and judgment in favor of appellees as to the property so claimed this appeal is prosecuted. The evidence discloses the insolvency of Procter Bros, at the time of these transactions, and there seems to have been no dispute on this, point in the trial court. A letter was read in evidence, dated February 9, 1887, from appellant to appellees, containing, among other things, in speaking of the failure of Procter Bros., this statement: “ Our agent, ■Mr. Burnett, happened there, and found that they really were in bad shape, and found that one of the brothers had bought the other out and was running the firm in an insolvent condition.” It also contains statements showing that the purpose of appellant and its agent in the transaction was to secure its debt. We conclude from the statement quoted above, there being nothing in the record in conflict with it, that appellant’s agent had notice at the time he acquired the stock of goods of the undisputed insolvency of Procter Bros. It also appears from the evidence that Burnett knew of the existence of appellees’ debt, but it does not clearly appear from the evidence that he took more goods than were reasonably required to satisfy appellant’s claim under the circumstances; and if so, that this was knowingly done. There is some evidence of a purpose on the part of Burnett to have' that part of the transaction concealed in which he agreed to pay money as a part consideration. The court refused to permit appellant to prove by the witness Burnett that his sole motive or purpose in making the purchase of the stock of goods was to collect the indebtedness against Procter Bros., and upon this the first error is assigned. It is no longer an open question in this State that such testimony is admissible. Hamburg v. Wood, 66 Texas, 168; Sweeney v. Conley, 71 Texas, 543; Brown v. Lessing, 70 Texas, 544. Complaint is also made of the action of the court in giving and refusing charges, and we are of opinion that some of the charges given contained error. It is well settled by numerous decisions of our Supreme Court, that where an insolvent debtor pays one of his creditors in property, and more property is conveyed than, under all the circumstances, would be reasonably required to pay the debt, and such creditor has knowledge of the insolvency, the existence of other creditors, and the excess in value of the goods received, the transaction is such as the law condemns, whether this excess is appropriated by the creditor to his own use or is paid to the debtor in money or negotiable paper. Elser v. Graber, 69 Texas, 222, and cases there cited. These cases, however, do not hold that where a preferred creditor pays money or executes a negotiable note to the insolvent debtor as part consideration for the transfer, the transaction will be declared fraudulent in law, where it is not made to appear that more goods have been knowingly received than are reasonably required to pay his debt. The true distinction applicable to the facts of this case is made in the case of Oppenheimer v. Halff & Bro., 68 Texas, 409. Delivered December 20, 1892. Where the property received by the preferred creditor is no more than is reasonably required to satisfy his debt, taking into consideration the expense incident to a conversion of the property into money, the invalidity of the transfer must result from proof of a fraudulent intent in fact on the part of the debtor and preferred creditor, which would taint the entire transaction. The testimony excluded, as to the intention of Burnett, was therefore material; and the charge should have properly submitted to the jury whether or not, under all the proof, more goods were knowingly received by appellant than were reasonably required to satisfy its debt; and if not, whether the transaction was open and fair, solely for the purpose on the part of appellant and its agent of collecting a just debt; or whether there was also a fraudulent purpose, to which appellant’s agent was privy. One of the charges complained of, in effect took the case from the jury, and held the transaction in question to be fraudulent, provided Burnett knew that the $75 note which he assumed was given in consideration of the sale of the goods from B. E. to J, V. Procter. The charge given at the request of appellees is subject to a like objection. For the errors in excluding above evidence and in the charge of the court, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Chief Justice Tarlton did not sit in this case.","Blankenship & Blake Co. v. P. J. Willis & Bro. No. 58. 1. Fraud, as to Creditors — Evidence of Motive. — Where a creditor purchases the goods of his insolvent debtor, and the transaction is attacked as in fraud of other creditors, he may testify that his motive in making the purchase was only to collect the debt due to himself. 2. Sale to Creditor Fraudulent as to Other Creditors, when.— Where an insolvent debtor pays one of his creditors in property, and more property is conveyed than would be reasonably required to pay the debt, and such creditor has knowledge of the insolvency, the existence of other creditors, and the excess in the value of the goods received, the transaction is such as the law condemns, whether this excess is appropriated by the creditor to his own use, or is paid to the debtor in money or negotiable paper. 3. Same —Sale not Fraudulent, when. — Where a preferred creditor pays money or executes a negotiable note to his insolvent debtor as part consideration for his purchase of the debtor’s goods, the transaction will not be declared fraudulent in law where it is not shown that more goods have been knowingly received than are reasonably required to pay the debt; following Oppenheimer v. Halff, 68 Texas, 409. 4. Same — Fraudulent Intent Requisite, when. — Where property received by a preferred creditor is no more than is reasonably required to satisfy his debt, taking into consideration the expense incident to a conversion of the property into money, the invalidity of the transfer, if it be invalid, must result from proof of a fraudulent intent in fact on the part of the debtor and preferred creditor. Appeal from Hill. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. B. D. Tarlton and W. C. Morrow, for appellant. 1. The witness Burnett having, as the agent of appellants, made the purchase from B. E. Procter, which was attacked as fraudulent, had a right to testify as to the motive which moved him in such purchase, such motive being on his part a matter not of opinion but of knowledge. Hamburg v. Wood, 66 Texas, 168; Phillips v. Edelstein, 2 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 451; Numson v. Ellis, 3 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 134; 1 Whart. Ev., 2 ed., secs. 482, 508; 2 Whart. Ev., sec. 955. 2. The debt due to appellant as creditor of Procter Bros, and the value of the goods received in satisfaction of it were so nearly equal that the further assumption by appellant of the small amounts due to J. V. Procter and to Wornell did not vitiate the transaction, there- being shown no fraudulent intent in fact on the part of appellant; and the court should have so charged, as requested. Allen v. Carpenter, 66 Texas, 138; Oppenheimer v. Halff, 68 Texas, 409; La Belle v. Tidball, 69 Texas, 161; Saddlery Co. v. Schoelkopf, 71 Texas, 418. 3. The court erred in its special charge requiring the jury to find for the plaintiff, if defendant agreed to pay an excess in money to Procter, without reference to the knowledge of defendant’s agent of the insolvent condition of Procter, or of the purpose of said agent in the purchase of the goods, or of the fraudulent intent on the part of Procter, whether known or unknown to such agent. Lambeth v. McClinton, 65 Texas, 109, 110; Lewy v. Fischl, 65 Texas, 320; Allen v. Carpenter, 66 Texas, 138. McKinnon & Carlton, for appellees. 1. Where a conveyance is attacked as fraudulent, it is not competent for the purchaser at such sale to testify as to his secret motives in maldng the purchase. Miller v. Jannett, 63 Texas, 82. 2. The $75 debt to J. Y. Procter was paid by appellant, not as a bonus or inducement to effect the trade, but as a part of the consideration for the goods; and being thus paid, the effect of the transaction was to place a part of the debtor’s goods, though a small part it was, beyond the reach of other creditors. The sale for this reason had in it the elements of fraud. Black v. Vaughan, 70 Texas, 47: Saddlery Co. v. Schoelkopf, 71 Texas, 418; Oppenheimer v. Halff, 68 Texas, 409; Greenleve v. Blum, 59 Texas, 124. 3. The charge of the court was substantially correct and warranted by the proof; and if any error therein, it was immaterial, as the jury, under the facts proven, could have properly rendered no other verdict.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This is an injunction suit, brought by the appellees Joe Flamblin and his wife Lula Hamblin on the 29th of February, 1888, against E. L. Antony, A. G-. Wilcox, and the appellant D. C. Freeman, and A. J. Lewis, the sheriff of Milam County,'to enjoin the enforcement of judgment in suit No. 1827, rendered in the District Court. The father of plaintiff Joe Hamblin owned a tract of 420 acres of land, upon which he lived, and which upon his death was inherited by Joe Hamblin in 1882. After the marriage of Joe Hamblin with Lula Hamblin they moved on the land as a home, where their three children were born and where they have since lived. A few months after their marriage the plaintiffs sold and conveyed off of the south end of the surve)r 54 acres, and received in exchange from one Chamberlain 64 acres of land adjoining the unsold balance. On the 12th day of August, 1884, Joe Hamblin conveyed to J. R. Hardeman what was estimated in the deed as 220 acres of the 420 acres, beginning on the north boundary line, a base line supposed by them to be 490 varas long and running south 19 west 2425 varas. The base line was really some 645 or more varas in length, so that allowing the side lines to govern, about 276 acres were inducted in the sale. The deed contained the following explanation: 11 The intention of these presents being to convey to said Hardeman all of my said tract of land (the 420 acres) save and except a homestead of 2.00 acres, measuring from the south boundary line thereof.” Before the deed was made, Hamblin and Hardeman stepped off the distance from the north boundary the estimated distance to include the 220 acres, and 11 came out,” as Hamblin testified, 11 where I claim the north line of the 200 acres to be. *' * ""* I did not make the deed to Hardeman. I got II. N. Roberts to do so. I carried him the stepping of myself and Hardeman and suppose he made the deed accordingly. Hardeman and myself did not survey the land, but we intended to run the land out afterward.” Sometime after the deed to Hardeman, Antony and Wilcox had an execution against Hamblin levied on the land described in the deed to Hardeman, under which it was sold and purchased by them. At this time none of the parties knew where the lines would place the survey, or that they would include any of the 200 acres reserved as a homestead, or now claimed as Hamblin’s homestead. The conveyance by Hamblin to Hardeman was made to place the land beyond the reach of his creditors. After the purchase by Antony and Wilcox they brought suit in the District Court of Milam County against Joe Hamblin and James Hardeman for the land; they appeared and answered (Hamblin disclaiming), and on the 20th of November, 1886, Antony and Wilcox recovered judgment against both defendants for the land, cancelling the deed from Hamblin to Hardeman. Writ of possession issued on the 10th of January, 1887, and was returned executed by placing the agent of Antony and Wilcox in possession, without disturbing Hamblin’s possession of the homestead claimed; the officer and, it seems, all the parties being ignorant of the locality of the survey — that the side lines would include Hamblin’s dwelling house, stable, barn, tenement houses, the family graveyard, the spring, and about 20 acres of cultivated land. D. C. Freeman, appellant, who had purchased the land from Antony and Wilcox and their vendees, having ascertained that his survey according to calls would include such part of the homestead of Hamblin, the same being occupied by him and tenants, on November 26, 1886, in vacation, applied to the district judge for an alias writ of possession, setting-out the fact that he had not been placed in possession. To this motion Joe Hamblin appeared, substantially setting up the facts stated in his bill for injunction — his homestead rights in the property, and the mistake,of the parties as to the locality of the 220 acres; praying that his homestead be protected — 200 acres north from the north line of the 54 acres sold to Chamberlain, a base of 645 yaras, the side lines 1750-J varas — and that the judgment in favor of Antony and Wilcox be so reformed as not to conflict with the homestead. Mrs. Hamblin was not a party to any of the foregoing proceedings. On the 29tli day of November, 1887, this injunction suit was brought and filed by Hamblin and wife, claiming homestead on the 420 acres tract 200 acres north of the Chamberlain 54 acres, setting up the foregoing-facts, and asking for relief as before stated. The motion for alias writ of possession and the petition for injunction were heard by the district judge on the 29th day of February, 1888, at the same time, and both granted «in chambers. The cause was finally tried October 24, 1888, and judgment rendered upon verdict for Hamblin and wife against all the defendants for their homestead as claimed by them, perpetually enjoining the enforcement of the judgment in so far as it interfered with the title and possession of the homestead. Some general observations as to the law applicable to this case will save us the trouble of a separate consideration of many special questions raised by the assignments of error. The husband can not convey the homestead without the consent of the wife, and without her joint conveyance executed and acknowledged by her as prescribed by the statute; nor can he sell a part of the actual homestead so used and occupied without such joint -conveyance. What property constitutes the homestead is sometimes a question of fact and law, but the homestead, whatever constitutes it, is not subject to disposition by the husband alone. The joint act of both husband and wife can not create any lien upon it or subject it to forced sale for debt. These principles are elementary. Under some circumstances the homestead may be designated by the head of the family, as where there is an excess of land in a rural homestead, but the husband can not exercise this prerogative so as to defraud the wife or to renounce the actual homestead. Medlenka v. Downing, 59 Texas, 32; Jacobs, Bernheim & Co. v. Hawkins, 63 Texas, 1; Kempner v. Comer, 73 Texas, 196; Land and Loan Co. v. Blalock, 76 Texas, 85. The most solemn renunciation of the actual homestead in use as such by husband and wife, executed in forms required in a conveyance of her separate estate, could not subject it to a deed of trust or a mortgage. Kempner v. Comer, 73 Texas, 196; Land and Loan Co. v. Blalock, 76 Texas, 85. It follows a fortiori that the hnsband alone can not by declaration or acts of sale renounce the homestead, and so subject it to execution. It is in effect claimed by appellant in this suit that the husband can by his individual conveyance, and without the knowledge or consent of the wife, designate the homestead so as to exclude a great part of it in actual use, even the home itself, and to subject the same to execution. This lie can not do. The deed to Hardeman has no force in this suit further than as a designation of the homestead, and it can not be used for that purpose. Freeman does not claim under it, but under judgment setting it aside. As a designation of the homestead, its calls, as we have seen, will actualty exclude a great part of the homestead of the family; besides the calls were made by mistake, which would not be binding. All the acts done by the parties at the time of and in connection with the deed as a designation should be considered. The actual measurement of Hamblin and Hardeman by stepping the distance — the very act of designation, in so far as it can be so called — “ came out” and terminated about the gate on the west line, which leaves the homestead as now claimed by the appellees untouched. It is wholly immaterial that Hardeman did not get 220 acres of land by the deed. The deed as such secured no right, and the land it purported to convey was recovered from him, because it conveyed nothing. The judgment against Hamblin and Hardeman for the land including a part of the Hamblin homestead was not binding upon Mrs. Hamblin, because she was not a party to it and was in no way affected by it, and because the homestead right was not involved. The contention of the appellant that the homestead rights of the parties were concluded by the judgment for the land amounts ""to this: “A judgment creditor can have the homestead sold under execution against the husband without the knowledge of the wife, purchase the property at the sale, then, by recovery of the property in suit against the husband, obtain a valid title to the homestead against both husband and wife, when the right of homestead was not in issue.” This proposition can not be maintained. The judgment would not be res adjudicata against the wife or in any manner disturb her homestead rights, more especially when she is ignorant of any effort to divest her of homestead title. It is of no consequence that the fee of the property was in the husband. Her homestead right attached to this separate estate as inviolably as it would to community property. We can not say either that the husband, Hamblin, was bound as to homestead rights by the judgment, or that it could be pleaded against him as the head of the family. He did not know that the land sued for embraced the homestead or any part of it, nor did the parties plaintiff in the suit. No one, so far as the record shows, supposed that it did. In the deed by Hamblin to Hardeman, from which the field notes were taken in making the levy, he reserved his homestead out of the 420 acres inherited from his father, making a mistake in basing it on the south line of the survey instead of the north line of the 54 acres sold to Chamberlain, but evidently claiming homestead in the 420 acres survey. This, connected with the fact that he and Hardeman in measuring off the land to be conveyed to the latter did not reach the homestead or intrude upon it, establishes the fact that he did not know, and that the parties recovering the land of him did not know, that the homestead was involved in the suit. The petition for injunction set up this mistake by appropriate averments, and it was sufficient to defeat the enforcement of the judgment against the homestead as represented by Hamblin himself. The homestead issue was not made in the suit, because it was thought not to be involved. The judgment did not conclude the parties upon the issue now in suit. Hamblin was not compelled and the court could not compel him to include the 64 acres convejred to him by Chamberlain in selecting his homestead. It has never been used as a part of the homestead and has never been selected for such purpose. No designation of the homestead had ever been made that is binding on Hamblin and wife until the institution of this suit, and of this defendant can not complain. Nothing had ever been done until this suit was filed but to acquire the excess of homestead in the 420 acres after deducting the land sold to Chamberlain. Hamblin and wife had the right to designate their homestead in this suit. The deed to Hardeman was relevant to the issue of designation or not at the time it was made, by which alleged designation the appellant has from the beginning claimed that Hamblin and wife were bound; and so was the evidence of Hardeman and Hamblin as to stepping the estimated distance on the west line of the land conveyed. The testimony of P. S. Ford, that the injunction and the order for alias writ of possession were considered and granted at the same time, if not material, was harmless. If there was any point in the alias at all, in so far as the homestead question was concerned, the testimony was material to show that the injunction, if perfected by bond, was intended to supersede the order authorizing the alias writ of possession. The orders of the court were of the same date. Delivered October 19, 1892. We think, however, that the homestead rights of Mrs. Hamblin could not be determined on application for a writ of assistance by the judge in chambers. She was in no way a party to the proceeding; and if she had been, her rights could not have been concluded by such a proceeding in chambers. Article 2875, Revised Statutes, does not apply to this suit. We have now disposed of every assignment of error called to our attention in appellant’s brief, and have found no error in the judgment of the court below or in the ridings. We are of the opinion the judgment should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed.","D. C. Freeman v. Joe Hamblin and Wife. No. 9. 1. Homestead — Husband Can Not Sell, etc, — The husband can not convey the homestead, nor a part thereof, without the consent of the wife and without her joint conveyance executed and acknowledged by her in the manner prescribed by the statute. 2. Designation of Rural Homestead. — When there is an excess of land in a rural homestead the homestead may be designated by the husband, but in such designation he can not renounce the actual homestead — that is, the place of residence. 3. Same. — The husband alone can not by declaration or acts of sale renounce the homestead, and so subject it to execution. So held, where the husband in a deed in fraud of his creditors conveyed a part of his rural homestead including his residence, etc. 4. Mistake — Effect of Judgment. — The husband being indebted, conveyed a part of his rural homestead in fraud of his creditors, by mistake including in the deed his actual residence. The land so conveyed was sold under execution. The purchasers brought suit to recover the land against the husband and his vendee. The deed was annulled for fraud and the land recovered. The wife was no party to the action for the land. The mistake was not discovered until after the judgment for the land had been rendered. Meld, that the proceedings did not affect the homestead rights of either the wife or the husband. The wife could not be concluded, not being party; nor the husband, by reason of the mistake in his deed. 5. Designation of Homestead. — The fraudulent deed by the husband having been set aside, could be considered only as an attempted designation of his homestead out of the larger tract. 6. Homestead Upon Separate Property of the Husband. — The wife's homestead rights attach to separate property of the husband when occupied, equally as if it were community. 7. Injunction Protecting the Homestead — Injunction was properly issued to protect the homestead rights of the wife against the enforcement of a judgment for the homestead, rendered in a suit against the husband in which the wife was not a party, and in which the homestead was not in issue, by reason of the ignorance of all parties to the suit that the lines of the land sued for encroached upon the actual homestead. 8. Designation of Homestead. — Courts can not control the designation of a rural homestead out of a larger tract, so as to include land never used or claimed as homestead by the family. 9. Injunction — Statute Construed. — Article 2875, Revised Statutes, does not apply to an injunction to protect the homestead against invasion under' a judgment for the recovery of the land, in which the wife was not a party. Appeal from Milam. Tried below before Hon. John N. Henderson. E. H. Lott, for appellant. 1. The 420 acres and the 64 acres obtained from Chamberlain being the separate property of Hamblin, he had, as the head of the family, the right to designate his homestead upon any part of said land; and the 220 acres conveyed to Hardeman being the separate property of Hamblin, he reserving in said deed a sufficient homestead, the land so reserved and designated became in effect the homestead of Hamblin and wife; and as the 220 acres had never been designated by Hamblin as his homestead, the deed to Hardeman and the subsequent conduct of Hamblin in cause No. 1827 was an abandonment by him of said 220 acres as his homestead, and a designation of 200 acres, 11 measuring from the south line ’ ’ of the 420 acres, as his homestead; and the judgment and proceedings in said cause were binding upon both Hamblin and his wife.

The judgment against Hardeman and Hamblin in cause No. 1827 •being alleged by the plaintiffs to be a valid and subsisting judgment, and no fraud being charged therein, the plaintiffs can not enjoin said judgment, because they show that they have slept upon their rights, if any they ever had, and that the issues sought to be determined in this case might have been determined in canse No. 1827, but for the negligence and want of diligence on the part of plaintiffs.

Levy, 63 Texas, 278; Clegg v. Darragh, 63 Texas, 357; Harn v. Phelps, 65 Texas, 592. 3. The judgment against Hamblin and Hardeman being a valid and subsisting judgment, rendered more than one year previous to the filing of the petition for injunction herein, the plaintiffs can not now enjoin the execution thereof, because their rights, if any they had, are barred by the statute of limitations. Rev. Stats., art. 2875; Cook v. Baldridge, 39 Texas, 250; Nichols v. Snow, 42 Texas, 72; Miller v. Clements, 54 Texas, 351. 4. The proof showed that the 200 acres claimed by plaintiffs as homestead had never been designated by them as their homestead until long after the judgment in cause No. 1827, and that the land north of plaintiffs’ dwelling was open and improved, and that there was sufficient land, including the 64 acres, to give plaintiffs a homestead of 200 acres southward. The plaintiffs should therefore have been at least confined within such boundaries as ""would have given them their improvements and 200 acres, and it was error to permit them to disregard the 64 acres and to recover 200 acres out of the original 420 acres tract. Const., art. 16, secs. 49-52. 5. The land was the separate property of the husband, and the wife was not a necessary party to the suit for its recovery. Const. 1876, art. 16, secs. 49-52; Rev. Stats., arts. 1205, 2343; Jergens v. Schiele, 61 Texas, 255; Read v. Allen, 56 Texas, 182; Foster v. Powers, 64 Texas, 247. Ford & Ford, for appellees. 1. If the land sued for and described in plaintiffs’ petition was in fact their homestead at the date of the deed from Hamblin to Hardeman (August 12, 1884,), and continued and remained so until after judgment was rendered in cause No. 1827, then Mrs. Lula Hamblin, the wife of plaintiff Joe Hamblin, was a necessary party to the suit. And if she was not made a party defendant in said cause, then the judgment therein is a nullity as to her, and the same did not preclude or in any manner affect her right or title thereto; and it is totally immaterial that the land upon which the homestead was located was separate property of the husband. 2. In order to constitute an abandonment of a homestead once established there must exist (1) an intention to abandon, (2) an actual abandonment and desertion of the home, and (3) the home must be actually deserted with the intention never to return; and (4) all these facts must clearly appear from the evidence."
"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. In the months of September, October, and November, 1889, appellees, Gage & Wood, were engaged in keeping a cotton yard in the town of Hillsboro. Appellants, through their agent, A. S. Johnson, were engaged at the same time and place in buying cotton. It was the custom of appellees in the transaction of their business, when a bale of cotton was left in their care, to issue to the owner a receipt, called a ticket, of substantially the following tenor: “ Received of-one bale of cotton for account of [name of owner], deliverable to bearer on return of this certificate and payment of charges'. Risks of fire excepted.” Upon this receipt were endorsed the weight and price and also the number marked upon the bale of cotton. In the latter part of September of that year, appellants, through their said agent, purchased of Stroud & Yerby, who held the receipts of Gage & Wood in the usual form, nine certain bales of cotton, which were transferred and delivered by a delivery of the receipts given for the nine bales of cotton. Thereafter these receipts were lost, according to the positive testimony of their said agent, which was not contradicted by any other testimony introduced on the trial of this cause, though the court found in his conclusions of fact that the loss of these receipts was not shown. Upon discovering that he was short the nine tickets, appellants’ agent promptly notified appellees of this fact, and demanded the possession,of the nine bales of cotton, marking each of them in red ink and furnishing to appellees a memorandum of the numbers of said bales of cotton, and protesting against their shipping or otherwise disposing of them. Appellees refused to comply with the demands of appellants unless they would produce the tickets or give an indemnity bond against future liability, which appellants failed to do. Thereafter appellees shipped or delivered one of these nine bales, No. 2999, to some unknown person in exchange for one of the alleged lost tickets. The testimony of appellees tended to corroborate rather than contradict that of appellants’ agent in reference to his selecting, marking, and demanding the nine bales of cotton prior to any disposition of the No. 2999, though the court, in the conclusions of fact, found that this number was shipped out in good faith in due course of business. This demand is alleged by appellants to have been made on the 4th of November of the year 1889, and the proof shows that it was made on or before that time. It was proven that the market value of the cotton at about that date and subsequently was 9-£ cents per pound, and that the several bales were of the weight alleged in plaintiffs’ petition. Appellants sued for the cotton or its value, and seem to have seized and replevied all the bales except No. 2999, though the record does not contain any of the sequestration proceedings. Judgment was rendered against appellants as to bale No. 2999, and the costs of the suit, and in their favor for the other bales, conditioned upon their executing to appellees an indemnity bond in the sum of $500, to be approved by the clerk of the court, within sixty days; and upon their failure to do so, that they take nothing by their suit, and that appellees recover against them and the sureties on their replevy bond the sum of $400, the value of said cotton, and the costs of suit; from which judgment this appeal is prosecuted. If the principles of negotiable instruments should be deemed entirely applicable to the receipts issued by appellees in the form set forth in the conclusions of fact, the judgment, in so far as it conditioned a recovery by the appellants on the execution of an indemnity bond, should be sustained. Dan. on Neg. Inst., sec. 1480. This rule results from that quality of negotiable paper which enables the holder in due course of trade to recover upon it, though his title be derived from the finder of lost paper or from one who has stolen it. Where the maker runs no risk of a second payment the rule has no application. Dan. on Neg. Inst., secs. 1481-1485. The receipt in question is essentially a warehouseman’s receipt, and is also analogous to a bill of lading of a common carrier, in form negotiable. It is held by the Supreme Court of the United States, even under statutes which declare bills of lading to be negotiable by endorsements and delivery, that, inasmuch as they represent goods and not money, in ease they should be lost or stolen, a bona fide holder who derives his title from a finder or a thief could not recover, as in case of negotiable paper under the law merchant. Any other holding would place the symbol upon a better footing than the thing represented, it being well settled that title to personal property can not be derived from one who has found it or stolen it from the owner. It follows that the cotton receipts in question are not clothed by the law with that superior quality of negotiable paper which enables a bona fide holder to recover, though the owner has not parted with his title. The reason for the rule therefore which requires indemnity from the loser as a condition precedent to recovery does not exist in this case. The true owner might, through his negligence or carelessness, be estopped from asserting his title against one holding from the finder or the thief, but no such case is here presented. Shaw v. Railway, 101 U. S., 416; Fried-lander v. Railway, 130 U. S., 416; Hutch, on Carr., 2 ed., sec. 129. It is settled in this State, that the owner of property held by a bailee may sue to recover it from the bailee, though not a party to the contract of bailment. Roberts v. Yarboro, 41 Texas, 453; Nelson v. King, 25 Texas, 663. Delivered December 20, 1892. We conclude that the judgment must be reversed and here rendered in favor of appellants for the nine bales of cotton, or the value of each, with lawful interest from November 4, 1887, and for costs. If the records below show that appellants have already, acquired the possession by replevy bond of any part of said cotton, that will operate a satisfaction pro tanto of this judgment. Reversed and rendered.","Clay & Browne v. Gage & Wood. No. 728. 1. Negotiable Instrument —Warehouseman’s Receipt. — A receipt from one engaged in keeping a cotton yard for a specified bale of cotton which, by the terms of the receipt, is “ deliverable to bearer on return of this certificate and payment of charges,” though in form negotiable, represents goods and not money; and in case it should be lost or stolen a bona fide holder who derives his title from a finder or a thief could not recover, as in case of negotiable paper under the law merchant. 2. Same — Indemnity Bond Against Lost Receipt. — Where the owner of such receipt proved its loss, and that he had not parted with his title to the property, it was error in the court to require, as a condition precedent to his recovering possession of the cotton from the warehouseman, that he execute to the latter a bond of indemnity to secure him harmless against loss. 3. Bailment — Right of Owner Against Bailee. — The owner of property held by a bailee may sue to recover it from the bailee, though not a party to the contract of bailment. Appeal from County Court of Hill. Tried below before Hon. J. G, Abney. McKinnon & Carlton, for appellants. 1. Appellants were entitled to judgment for the bale of cotton No. 2999, the proof showing that it was shipped out of the yard by appellees after notice of appellants’ claim thereto. Roberts v. Yarboro, 41 Texas, 453; Nelson v. King, 25 Texas, 663. 2. The court erred in requiring appellants to give to appellees an indemnity bond for the other cotton merely because the receipts therefor were lost. No one except appellants was asserting title or claim to said cotton. The lost cotton tickets were non-negotiable, and there was no necessity for requiring the bond. Burton v. Curyea, 89 Am. Dec., 354; Bice v. Cutler, 84 Am. Dec., 747; Hentz v. The Idaho, 23 U. S., 978. Smith & Wear and West & McGown, for appellees. 1. The judgment as to bale No. 2999, being rendered on conflicting evidence, should not be disturbed. De Cordova v. Bahn, 74 Texas, 645; Coffield v. Harris, 2 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 317; Viniola v. Kuenzek, 1 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 634. 2. The cotton being deliverable to the bearer of the lost receipts, by the terms thereof, such receipts are governed by the same rules that govern negotiable instruments. Gage & Wood being liable to the bearer of the receipts, were entitled to their production and surrender before delivery of the cotton could be exacted; this being physically impossible, because of their loss, the asserted owner ought and must tender a sufficient indemnity in some form before the court would order the surrender of the cotton.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. October 12, 1888, appellant sued appellee, in trespass to try title, for 320 acres of land situated in Llano County. Appellee pleaded not guilty, stale demand, and that he was an innocent purchaser for value of the land sued for. The case below was tried by the court without a jury, and judgment rendered in favor of appellee. 1. Appellant and appellee, as common source of title, each claim the land under a deed executed July 19, 1878, by Mrs. R. T. Norwood and husband, P. T. Norwood, to James H. Rogers. 2. The deed recites, that the consideration for the transfer is “an assignment and transfer to Mrs. R. T. Norwood by James H. Rogers, agent of E. F. Golson & Co., of a certain judgment recovered by Golson xfe Co. against Norwood Bros., on the 4th day of May, 1874, §17,257.34, and Mrs. Norwood assuming plaintiff’s liability for the costs of suit.” The deed then proceeds to convey the land to James H. Rogers. 3. James H. Rogers was the attorney for E. F. Golson & Co. in obtaining the judgment against Norwood Bros, described in the deed. 4. For his services in obtaining the judgment, Rogers was to be paid 10 per cent thereof, and only received from Golson & Co. §200 before the deed was executed to him by Mrs. Norwood. 5. At the time the deed was executed by Mrs. Norwood, Rogers, as the agent and attorney of Colson & Co., executed and delivered to her a written assignment and transfer of the judgment mentioned in the deed as the consideration for the transfer of said land by Mrs. Norwood. 6. The transfer of the judgment to Mrs. Norwood and the purchase of the land by Rogers was upon the authority of a certain letter written by appellant E. F. Colson to Rogers, wherein he was empowered to make the-trade, and wherein it was agreed that if the trade was made, he, Rogers, was to receive one-half the land received in settlement of the judgment as balance due him on the fee. 7. At the time the letter was written and at the time the purchase of the land was made by Rogers, Colson & Co. had transferred to appellant all interest in the judgment, and he became the owner thereof and successor to the firm of Colson & Co. 8. The above deed from Norwood to Rogers was soon after its execution duly recorded in Llano County.. 9. March 12, 1887, James H. Rogers, by deed, transferred the land toappellee, John A. Fielder. 10. At the time of the transfer by Rogers to Fielder, Fielder’s attorney inquired of Rogers as to the owvership of the land, and he was told that he (Rogers) owned the land. 11. Since the transfer to Rogers by Mrs. Norwood, he and Fielder have paid all taxes due on the land, and have claimed to own it. 12. The consideration for the land paid to Rogers by Fielder was a debt of about $590, due from Rogers to Fielder for merchandise sold Rogers by Fielder prior to purchasing the land, and about $50 cash paid at the time of the sale. 13. It does not appear from the evidence that Fielder had any notice (and the inference is from the testimony of Todd and Rogers that he did not have any notice, although lie himself does not testify) of the existence of the letter from appellant to Rogers authorizing him to transfer the judgment for the land, and also of the execution and existence of the transfer of the judgment, or of the contents of either of said instruments. 14. Appellant lives in Orange County, Virginia, and it does not appear that he ever lived in Texas, and it does not appear that he ever knew that Rogers was asserting an adverse claim or exclusive ownership to the land, or that he had paid taxes on it. 15. Rogers has never paid appellant any part of the consideration for the sale of the land, nor has appellant ever received any transfer to any part of the land, except as above stated, that was transferred to Rogers, by Norwood in consideration of the transfer of the judgment. The court below, upon the facts as stated, found the following as its conclusions of law: “That the deed from Mrs. Norwood to James H. Rogers, conveying to him a fee simple title, was not, by reason of recitals of consideration, notice to Fielder that Rogers held the land or any part of it in trust for E. F. Golson; and being put upon inquiry by said recitals, the inquiries being pursued by his attorney, led to the conclusion that the title to all of said survey was absolutely vested in James H. Rogers. The said Fielder having paid a valuable consideration for the land, is an innocent purchaser in good faith, without notice of plaintiff’s claim, and judgment is rendered in favor of defendant.” . This conclusion of the court below can not be sustained, for two reasons: 1. Because the recital upon the face of the deed from Mrs. Norwood and husband to James H. Rogers, that the consideration paid for the land was the transfer of the judgment in the case of Golson & Co. v. Norwood & Bro., by James H. Rogers as agent, had the effect to impress the legal title of the land held by Rogers with an express trust in favor of Golson & Co. The statement of this fact upon the face of the deed was sufficient to put a purchaser from Rogers upon notice that he held the legal title in trust for the true owner, and such purchaser would acquire the estate charged with such equitable title. The declaration made by Rogers to the attorney of appellee in selling the land, that he owned it, would not have the effect of defeating the equitable title disclosed by the deed under which he held. Appellee could not rely upon such declarations as having the effect as declared by the trial court. The declarations of Rogers asserting title in himself would not affect the rights of the true owner. And we know of no principle of law that permits a purchaser to rest his title, either legal or equitable, upon the declarations of the seller as affecting the title asserted by another. 2. Because the facts show, that the greater part of the consideration paid by Fielder for the land was a pre-existing debt due him by Rogers. Such a consideration can not be the basis of an innocent purchase except, to the extent of the amount actually paid at the time of the purchase» Overstreet v. Manning, 67 Texas, 660. We think, under the facts as shown by the letter written to Rogers by Golson, by authority of which he acted in purchasing the land and transferring the judgment therefor, that Rogers was entitled to one-half of the land, and that appellee is likewise entitled to such extent by virtue of the deed executed to him by Rogers. The interest of appellee to this extent is virtually admitted by appellant in stating his third assignment of error. In view of the disposition we make of the case, we deem it proper to say, that we do not think the facts of this case call for an application of the doctrine of stale demand. The facts show that Rogers, at the time he took the conveyance to himself, was the agent and attorney for appellant; occupying this relationship, he would not be permitted to acquire title adverse to his principal, but he holds it charged with an express trust in favor of the party he represents. Further, the facts show that by virtue of the terms of the letter from appellant under which he acted in purchasing the land, he, by reason of the purchase, became an owner in common with appellant. In either case, whether as holder of the legal title charged with the express trust or as tenant in common, stale demand will not commence to run until an unequivocal act of repudiation or ouster asserted by him. Simply the payment of taxes will not amount to an ouster or repudiation of the title of the true owner, nor will the assertion of claim to the entire tract have that effect, unless notice of such fact is brought home to the other cotenant or owner. 13 Am. and Eng. Encycl. of Law, 688; Phillipson v. Flynn, 83 Texas, 581. For the reasons indicated, we reverse the judgment below, and here render judgment in favor of appellant for one-half of the land sued for, and for all costs of suit, together with the costs of this appeal. Reversed and rendered. Delivered February 1, 1893.","THIRD DISTRICT, FEBRUARY, 1893. E. F. Golson v. John A. Fielder. No. 69. 1. Express Trust—Recitals.—Mrs. ST. and husband executed a deed for certain lands to R., the deed reciting that the consideration for the transfer was the transfer of a judgment in favor of G. and against If. & Bro. by R. as agent. R. conveyed the land to appellee. Held, that the recitals in the deed to R. had the effect to impress the legal title held by R. with an express trust in favor of the plaintiffs in the judgment transferred in exchange for the land. A subsequent purchaser under R. is charged with notice of the trust. 2. Same — Repudiation of Trust. — The holder of the legal title to land hound by an express trust can not destroy the estate of the beneficiary by denying such trust. See example. 3. Antecedent Indebtedness. — A purchaser of the legal title without notice of a trust can not defend as an innocent purchaser when the consideration is the credit of an antecedent indebtedness. To the extent of such indebtedness, the purchase is subject to the trust, although the purchaser had no notice. 4. Attorney and Client.—An attorney authorized by his client to dispose of a judgment, and under such authority takes land for it, by taking title in his own name, can not acquire title against his client. 5. Stale Demand.—Stale demand will not run in favor of one holding land charged with an express trust, or of a tenant in common, until an unequivocal act of repudiation or of ouster is shown. Payment of taxes will not have the effect of a repudiation of the trust, nor will a claim of the entire estate, unless brought home to the beneficiary. Appeal from Llano. Tried below before Hon. A. W. Moursdnd. W. T. Dalrymple, for appellant. 1. A purchaser paying for land with a pre-existing debt is not an innocent purchaser. Watkins v. Edwards, 23 Texas, 447; Hawley v. Bullock, 29 Texas, 222; Rodgers v. Burchard, 34 Texas, 453; Overstreet v. Manning, 67 Texas, 657; 10 Paige, 180; 61 Texas, 648; 10 Wend., 86; 20 Johns. (N. Y.,) 639. 2. A purchaser is chargeable with notice of the recitals in his chain of title. 14 Texas, 557; 55 Texas, 1, 102; Caruth v. Grigsby, 57 Texas, 259; 48 Texas, 469; Carver v. Jackson, 4 Peters, 1; 1 Greenl. Ev., sec. 23. 3. The court erred in giving the defendant judgment for all of the land, because the evidence all shows conclusively that defendant was only entitled to one-half the land, and plaintiff the other half. Blankenship v. Douglas, 26 Texas, 226; Burns v. Ross, 71 Texas, 516. Geo. T. Todd and Miller & Lauderdale, for appellee. 1. The principle, that he who bays and credits the purchase price on a judgment debt due by an insolvent debtor, is not a bona fide purchaser for value, is confined to judicial sales as against the rights of prior purchasers, and holders of the legal title whose deeds are unrecorded. Blankenship v. Douglas, 26 Texas, 226; Ayres v. Duprey, 27 Texas, 593; Grace v. Wade & Mains, 45 Texas, 522. 2. While as between Rogers and Golson Bros, a trust in fact might, in a reasonable time, have been shown (Neill v. Keese, 13 Texas, 187), yet as against third parties and innocent purchasers without other notice than the deed itself, no such trust can be shown. 3. The deed from P. T. Norwood and wife to J. H. Rogers, made in 1878, was duly placed upon record in Llano County as soon as made. J. H. Rogers rendered and paid all taxes in his own name, and openly and notoriously claimed the land, and exercised exclusive and undisturbed ownership and control for more than ten years, without objection or protest; and appellant is now estopped and barred by prescription and by stale demand from asserting or maintaining any secret equity in himself after such a lapse of time.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. The holding of the county judge, that because the road of appellant was not fenced at the point where the animal was killed, it was liable without proof of negligence in such killing, was erroneous. The evidence showed, that at that place appellant had established a flag station and siding where passengers were taken on and put off, and where freight was received and delivered by it, and where switching of trains was necessary for these purposes. It also appeared that across its main line and switch appellant kept up a crossing for a road, which had been in use there for ten or fifteen years, and that it was upon this crossing that the mare was struck. In the case of Railway v. Cocke, 64 Texas, 154, it is said: 16 Under statutes the same as in force in this State it has been held, that the general terms used in such statutes imposing liability on railway companies for injuries done to animals unless their railways are fenced, do not apply to such places as public necessity or convenience require should be left unfenced, as the streets of a city or town, depots, and contiguous grounds, the crossings of highways, and other like places.” In Railway v. Dunham, 68 Texas, 232, the same principle is recognized and applied to depot grounds. The language just quoted would embrace the ‘ ‘ depot and contiguous grounds” in this case and the switches upon which the animal was killed; and those decisions are conclusive of this case, unless this particular stopping place does not come within the principle, upon which they rest. Some language used in those opinions, and also in cases decided by the Court of Appeals (2 Willson’s Civil Cases, sections 374, 670), is to the effect, that the exemption from the requirement to fence would exist only with respect to places where a fence would be unlawful. That language should be understood with reference to the facts which were under discussion, and to the point before the mind of the court, the exemption claimed being from a fencing of public streets of a town, which is forbidden by law. These decisions should not be construed to mean that no exception can be allowed from the statutory requirement to fence except in cases where a compliance would be a violation of positive law. The true principle, which is the result of the authorities, is stated in the extract above given from 64 Texas, and embraces within the exception all places which “ public necessity or convenience require should be left unfenced.” Access to and from stations and the grounds around them necessary to their proper use and convenience must be allowed to passengers and freighters. Article 4226, Revised Statutes, requires railway companies to receive and discharge freight and passengers at sidings and stopping places for receiving and discharging way passengers and freight. Article 4239 provides, that “ when a company constructs a switch on its road for the accommodation of freighters, they shall be bound to furnish a sufficient number of cars for the transportation of freight therefrom when requested so to do.” These provisions were made for the benefit of shippers and passengers, and full effect is not given to them if the carrier is required to fence them in, and thereby obstruct the public in the free enjoyment of the privileges thus sought to be secured. The mere fact that Quarry was a station at which trains stopped only when passengers or freight were to be received or discharged can not, in our opinion, take it out of the operation of the rule which relieves railways from the necessity of fencing their depot grounds. Those who got on or off the cars or shipped or received goods there were as much entitled to free access as were those dealing with appellant at its regular stations. The right to leave its track unfenced there was proper to the discharge of the duties resting upon the carrier. This view of the case makes it unnecessary for us to determine whether or not the road which crossed appellant’s track was such as appellant was bound to leave open. The court erred in holding that appellant was liable had no negligence been shown. The court held, that the killing of the mare was caused by negligence of the employes of appellant running the train. This finding is attacked as being unsupported by evidence. While the testimony tending to establish negligence is weak and of a negative character, and is contradicted by positive evidence, we can not say that the judgment is so entirely without evidence to support it as to justify this court in setting it aside. In such cases the rule is that the appellate court will affirm the judgment, whether the finding on the facts meets its approval or not. Affirmed. Delivered February 2, 1893.","Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. E. B. Wallace. No. 213. 1. Unfenced Track at Flag Station.—There was a flag station, siding, and public road crossing at the place where the animal was killed. The general terms used in the statute imposing liability on railway companies for Injuries-done to animals, unless their railways are fenced, do not apply to such places as public necessity or convenience require should be left unfenced. Railways are by statute required to receive and discharge freight and passengers at sidings, and to furnish cars for transportation of freight therefrom when requested, and full effect can not be given to them if the carrier is required to fence sidings at flag stations. It was therefore error for the court below to hold that appellant was liable, without proof of negligence. 2. Conflicting Evidence—Judgment Affirmed.—The testimony tending to establish negligence was weak, and was contradicted by positive evidence, but the court held that the killing of the mare was caused by the negligence of appellant's employes, and in such cases the rule is to affirm the judgment, whether the finding on the facts meets the approval of this court or not. Appeal from Washington. Tried below before Hon. Lafayette Kirk, County Judge. J. W. Terry and H. I. Phillips, for appellant. 1. The animal was killed at a place on defendant company’s main track where it is crossed by a county road. The said highway had been used by the public as a county road for fifteen years or more, and before defendant’s railway was constructed. It would have been unlawful for defendant to have closed said highway by a fence or otherwise. Penal Code, art. 405; Rev. Stats., arts. 4232, 4170; 1 W. & W. C. C., secs. 82, 862; 2 Willson’s C.C.-, sec. 204. 2. The accident happened at a station or siding where passengers and freight were daily received and discharged. Defendant is absolved from the duty of fencing its track at such places, and is not liable on account of stock killed on its station grounds in the absence of proof of negligene. Railway v.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This suit was commenced October 16, 1882, by appellee as receiver of the Texas Continental Meat Company, a Texas corporation, in the District Court of Victoria County, against certain stockholders of said company, some of whom were alleged in said petition to have been original subscribers to the capital Stock of said company before its organization, or before its charter was filed, as shown by the following agreement, to-wit: “Victoria, Texas, October 17, 1882. “We, the undersigned, agree with Captain A. F. Higgs and with each other to subscribe for and hereby subscribe the amounts set opposite our respective names to the capital stock of the Texas Continental Meat Company, a corporation to be chartered under the laws of Texas, with headquarters at Victoria. The said company is to be stocked at $500,000, and we are to receive $2 of said stock for every dollar of cash subscribed. The amount of the capital stock not subscribed for or otherwise disposed of to remain in the company as reserve. It is further agreed, that should our whole subscription not be required, we will take stock in proportion to our subscriptions.” The charter, it is alleged, was filed on the 20tli day of October, 1882. That at a meeting of the stockholders held soon after the filing of said charter the board of directors of said company was authorized to issue for cash subscriptions shares of full paid stock of the company at the rate of $2 in stock for $1 in cash, such issue not to exceed $120,000, and said directors were to contract with Captain A. F. Higgs for the issuance to him of one-fourth of the capital stock as disposed of in the way of a bonus, and for certain rights, and to retain in the treasury of the company as a reserve the balance, to be disposed of as the growth and necessities of the'company require. That by reason of the issuance of said stock two for one to each of said subscribers, each of them became liable to pay to said corporation the par value of said stock so agreed to be issued by said company to them and each of them, with interest. The petition then shows, that after the organization of said Texas Continental Meat Company, and its actual commencement and transaction of business at Victoria, the said company made and entered into the following contract for the extension of its business at the city of Fort Worth, in Tarrant County, Texas, and for other and further subscriptions to its capital stock, which contract is in writing, executed and delivered for the consideration therein stated by the persons whose names are signed thereto, to-wit: “ Fort Worth, Texas, August 4, 1883. “We, the undersigned, agree to subscribe and hereby do subscribe the sums of money set opposite our respective signatures to the capital stock of the Texas Continental Meat Company, a corporation created by and existing under the laws of Texas, and having its domicile in Victoria, Texas. And we offer said subscriptions to said company under the following stipulations and conditions, to-wit: “1. That said company shall erect and operate as soon as possible, in or in the immediate vicinity of Fort Worth, a slaughter house, capable of killing, storing, and shipping not less than 250 grown cattle per diem. “2. Should one-half the sum necessary to erect, equip, and operate said house be less than the amount of our subscriptions, only such a portion of our subscriptions shall be called for as will be equal to said half; provided further, that our subscriptions, or any portion thereof, shall be Subject to call at any time until April 1,1884, and that any portion thereof not then called in by said company shall by said company and by us be considered null and void. “3. That for our said subscriptions we shall receive certificates of stock in said company in the following proportion, to-wit, for $60 cash we shall receive $85 in stock; provided, that we shall not be entitled to any issue of stock until we have responded to each call to the amount of our respective subscriptions, and that if we shall fail to pay any installments all previous payments shall be forfeited; provided, however, that when our certificates of stock are issued our rights, duties, obligations, and privileges shall relate back to the time of the acceptance of this offer. “4. That immediately after the acceptance hereof by the company, the charter shall be so amended as to provide for thirteen directors, of whom six shall be immediately elected from the undersigned; but this agreement shall not operate so as to guarantee the election of parties who shall cease to own any stock, or dispose of so much as to be only nominally stockholders; that this shall have the full force and effect of a contract whenever accepted by said company, and the collections of said subscriptions may be enforced as any other debt or obligation.” And the persons who subscribed said instrument, some forty in number, were also made parties defendant, and with reference to the liability of whom the following allegations were made: “ That the instrument aforesaid was delivered by said subscribers to said company at Victoria on the 25tli day of August, 1883, and was then and there submitted to a meeting of the stockholders of said company, then and there assembled, for action thereon. That said stockholders’ meeting, then and there acting in behalf of said company, did adopt the following resolution of acceptance of said proposition, to-wit: “ Resolved,, That the proposition made to this company by J. P. Smith, II. C. Edrington, and others, of Fort Worth, Texas, under date of August 14, 1883, be and is hereby accepted, reference being had to the communication of August 25, 1883, from A. F. Higgs, Esq., and that the directors of this company be and are hereby empowered to do all things necessary to comply with the undertaking required of this company by said proposition. That the secretary of the company be directed to spread a copy of said proposition on the books of this company, and to officially transmit as the acceptance of said proposition a copy thereof, a copy of this resolution, and of said communication from A. F. Higgs, together with copies of any other proceedings of this body and of the directory as may be pertinent to the contract consummated by the acceptance of this proposition, to Fort Worth, for the examination and information of the signers of said proposition, notifying each subscriber of the acceptance of the proposition and where such copies can be seen and examined.” Plaintiff’s petition alleges, that in pursuance of said contract the said Fort Worth subscribers elected their six directors, who, with an assistant secretary and treasurer, took immediate charge and management of the business of said corporation at Fort Worth, under the general direction of the whole board of directors, and that said corporation erected the slaughter house named in the contract, and proceeded to operate the same and continued to transact business at Fort Worth for sometime; and that by reason thereof, and by the execution and delivery of said contract and its acceptance as aforesaid, they and each of the subscribers to said contract became bound to pay to said company the full amount of the stock they contracted to be issued to them, to-wit, for each 860 of cash subscribed $85, the amount of stock they were by the contract to receive. That so far as said subscription in cash was paid by said subscribers, the Stock for $85 for every $60 paid was issued to them and each of them in proportion to his payment; that they had, each and all of them, contracted for $85 of stock for each $60 paid by them and each of them, and that by reason of said contract they were bound to pay, if necessary to secure the solvency of said company, the whole par value of the stock contracted to be issued to them and each of them. Plaintiff further alleges, that none of the subscribers have paid any more than the proportion of $60 for each $85 issued or to be issued to them. It was alleged that some of them had not paid the full amount they agreed to pay. The petition then proceeds to set out the amount for which each of said Fort Worth defendants is liable. The petition further alleges, that other defendants sued therein did not sign either of the contracts of subscription to the stock of said company, but bought stock at a discount and became liable and bound themselves to pay the par value of the stock issued or to be issued to each of them, the balance due thereon against each of said subscribers being stated as above. The plaintiff then proceeds to show, that he was appointed receiver of all the property of said corporation by the District Court of Victoria County on the 16th day of April, 1884, at the suit of Ayres & Cannon et ah, creditors of that company; that he had duly qualified; and that he brings this suit by virtue of an order of said District Court, as follows: “ In this cause the motions of Fagan & Osgood, the Sterne Fertilizer and Chemical Manufacturing Company, the New Orleans National Bank, creditors pf the Continental Meat Company, defendant in this cause, coming on to be heard by the court, and it appearing to the court from the report of the receiver and from the record in this cause that all the property of said defendant, the Texas Continental Meat Company, has been sold under the order of this court, and that the proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the debts of said defendant company as the same have been proved in this case and have been approved by the orders of this court, and that there is still a large indebtedness of said defendant company unpaid, and that said unpaid indebtedness will be lost to the creditors of said defendant company unless the stockholders of said company be compelled to pay any balance or balances which may be due from each and all of said stockholders upon subscription of stock made by them or any of them or upon the stock of said company which has been issued to them or each of them. “Now, therefore, the motion of said creditors is granted, and F. R. Pridham, receiver in this ease, hereby ordered, directed, and empowered to institute proceedings at law or in equity to enforce the payment of any balance of stock which is unpaid upon subscription of stock made by them or either of them or upon certificates of stock issued by said defendant company to any one or all of said stockholders, for the use and benefit of said creditors moving herein, and of all other creditors of said defendant company whose claims have been approved by this court; and that any sum or sums recovered in such legal or equitable proceedings be reported to this court in order that it may be distributed under the direction of this court among said creditors. In case any of the stock of said company has been transferred or assigned and such assignment accepted by any person or persons, it is ordered that such person or persons be included in this order and sued as stockholders. This order is made without prejudice to any legal or equitable defense which any one or the whole of said stockholders may have or make against such proceedings as may be taken against them or either of them.” Plaintiff further alleges, that in the suit 1928 he had been appointed auditor to audit the claims of creditors against said company, and that he had audited and approved claims, which were afterwards approved and allowed by the court on May 30, 1885; and the order appointing him auditor, his report as such, specifying claims allowed, and the order of the court approving and allowing them, with a list thereof, were all attached as exhibits to the petition. The claims they established aggregated $85,394.01, and that other claims amounting to $5315 were after-wards allowed by the court as valid debts against said company, which were also specified in exhibit. The whole indebtedness of said company, as allowed and approved by the court, aggregated $90,682.78; that the receiver had paid to the creditors aforesaid the sum of $10,483.92, and that there now remains due and unpaid the sum of $80,198.86, with interest, and that there is no property or assets of said company to meet said debts, but that said company is totally and hopelessly insolvent. Plaintiff then prays for judgment of such amount against each defendant as may be sufficient to pay off the indebtedness due by said company. The petition alleged residence of some of the defendants to be in Victoria County and of others to be in various other counties of the State. All defendants except those residing in Victoria County excepted to the petition because it showed that they were improperly sued in that county, and showed no right of Pridham to sue in his own name as receiver. They also duly pleaded their residence in other counties and their privilege to be sued there. General demurrers and special exceptions were taken to the petition on the following grounds: 1. Misjoinder of parties defendant, because of lack of privity or joint obligation, between the different defendants. 2. Misjoinder of distinct causes of action. 3. Because recovery was sought for excess of face value of stock over the amounts paid therefor, when such excess in the issue of stock was void. 4. Because the receiver sets up a cause of action upon which the corporation could not recover, and does not show that he is entitled to represent the rights of creditors, or set up any liability of such defendants to such creditors. 5. Because the petition fails to state facts showing liability of the company to the creditors named. 6. Because the allegations as to the allowance of claims in the receivership proceeding are not sufficient to show the establishment of the debts. 7. Because the petition fails to state the facts out of which each debt grew, with the names of the creditors and dates of accrual. 8. Because the amended petition (the same above stated) sets up a different cause of action from that originally alleged, and because the right thus asserted is barred by limitation. The defendants sued on the Fort Worth contract further excepted specially to the petition, on the grounds that the contract made their liability to depend on conditions not alleged to have been performed, viz. : 1. The erection and operation of a slaughter house at Fort Worth. 2. That if one-half of the cost of erecting, equipping, and operating the slaughter house should be less than the amount subscribed, only such portion of that amount should be called for as would equal one-half of such cost. 3. The right Of subscribers to forfeit amounts paid and refuse to take stock. 4. That the charter was to be amended so as to provide for thirteen directors, etc. 5. That the capital stock was to be $500,000 paid up, and no allegation that all had been paid or subscribed for. The original petition was not so full as the amended petition in regard to the claims of creditors. It charged that by their subscriptions the defendants became liable to the corporation for the par value of the stock. It did allege, however, that plaintiff sued as receiver appointed in the suit of Ayres & Cannon, by virtue of the order of the District Court of Victoria County, set up the amount of debts established against the corporation, and the insolvency of the corporation, and with these differences we infer that it was the same as the amended petition. It is not in the record, but there is an agreement partially stating its contents. Several of the defendants sued as signers of the first contract pleaded in setoff debts which they alleged the corporation owed them for money advanced to it by them while operating its business. The Fort Worth defendants pleaded general denial, and special pleas as follows: 1. That their signatures to the contract sued on were procured by false representations made by the corporation through its officers as to its indebtedness and business prosperity. 2. That neither Pridham, as receiver, nor the corporation was the owner of the claim sued on, and that neither has any right or title to or interest in the claim sued on, but that it had been adjudged to Ayres & Cannon. 3. That the charter of said meat company provided for a capital stock of $500,000, divided into 5000 shares, be fully paid up; that there never has been but 3000 shares of said stock subscribed for, and that the subscription books of said company have long since been closed, and that therefore the said subscription is not binding upon them. 4. That prior to the 14th day of August, 1883, the company had organized under its charter and had commenced business, and that the instrument signed by the defendants is not an original subscription of stock, but the stock referred to therein was of the residue of stock belonging to said company which had not been subscribed for or disposed of prior to said 14th day of August, 1883; and that the directors and stockholders did thus determine and agree and dispose of the same as provided in said contract; and that at the time of signing of said instruments by defendants, the stock of said company was not worth in the market more than $60 for $85 face value, and intrinsically was not worth anything; that said contract was entered into on the part of the defendants in good faith and for the benefit of the company, and that they had paid to said company an amount of money set opposite their names in contract. 5. Limitation of two and four years. 6. That by the terms of the contract sued on it was agreed that one-half the cost of building and equipping refrigerating works at Fort Worth should be paid by the meat company, and that defendants who signed the contract of August 14, 1883, should pay the other half and no more; and that it was further provided in said contract, that if one-half of the sum necessary to locate, equip, and operate said houses be less than the whole of said subscription, as shown in said contract, only such portion of said subscription should be called for as would be equal to said half; that said equipments and building in full only cost the sum of $60,000, and by reason thereof these defendants would not be liable in any event for more than one-half of said subscription, and that they have paid more than the legal amount due from them to said company. 7. That at the time they signed said contract as aforesaid, and in order to induce them to do so, the said company represented to them that it was amply able to and would furnish one-half of the money necessary to purchase, locate, and equip the houses at Fort Worth, and that the signers of said contract would only have to furnish the other one-half; that said statement was false and untrue, and was made to deceive the said defendants, and by reason of said statement and others hereinbefore pleaded that defendants were induced to sign their names to said contract, and that they would not have done so except for the fact that they believed in and relied on said statements as true, and did not know that they were false and untrue. 8. That the creditors named in the petition, so far as their claims accrued before defendants signed said contract, did not contract with said company or extend credit to it on the faith or credit of the defendants’ subscription to said contract; and all the creditors whose claims accrued after the defendants signed said contract had full knowledge of the terms and conditions upon and by which defendants were to obtain stock in said company, and consented and acquiesced therein at and before the time such credit was extended to said company and at and before the creation of said debts. 9. That defendants after making payments as alleged elected to forfeit the amount so paid by them on the said subscription or contract of purchase, and to forfeit their right to demand and receive any of said stock of said company, and never did demand or receive from said company any of said shares of stock, and are therefore.not liable any further on said contract or otherwise. The plaintiff demurred generally to all the pleas in abatement, and filed the following special exceptions, all of which were sustained by the court: 1. To the plea setting up fraud on the part of the company and its officers in procuring subscription to said paper sued on, because fraud between the corporation and stockholders themselves can not affect the creditors of said corporation. 2. To the plea setting up illegality of the alleged issue of stock, because the defendants participated in the alleged illegal act and became members of the corporation, and are therefore estopped from denying their liability to creditors. 3. To the plea that the charter of said meat company fixed the capital stock at $500,000 fully paid, and that the full amount was never subscribed, because said stockholders were bound to the said creditors for any subscription by them made, whether the whole stock authorized by the charter of said corporation was subscribed or not. 4. To the plea of defendants setting up payment in full for the stock as subscribed for in said contract, because each defendant is bound to creditors to pay the par value of the stock contracted for. 5. To the plea setting up that the stock issued to them in excess of the amount paid to them was illegal, because acceptance of said stock binds the defendants to pay the par value thereof to creditors. 7. To the plea setting up offset and counter-claim made by the Victoria defendants on ground that it could not be allowable against creditors. 8. To the plea of limitation of two and four years respectively pleaded by defendants, because in an, action of this character the statute of limitations, as pleaded, can not avail the defendants as a defense to plaintiff’s action. 9. To the plea setting up that the company agreed to pay one-half of the cost of building and equipping refrigerator works at Fort Worth, because said plea offers no defense to the action for the use of creditors. 10. To the plea setting up that the defendants were induced by false representations made by the officers and agents of the company to sign the contract, because the same can in no way affect plaintiff’s rights to recover herein. 11. To the plea alleging right to forfeit the amount paid on the subscription contract, and that defendants did not demand or receive shares from the company, because defendants, as their pleadings show, were in a position to demand the rights and benefits of shareholders. The court overruled all exceptions to the petition except those based on the failure of plaintiff to allege the facts showing the liability of the corporation for the debts set up in the petition. The plaintiff was required to amend so as to show the name of each creditor, the amount due him, the date at which it accrued, and the date of its approval by the court; and this having been done, all exceptions to the petition were overruled. All the exceptions above stated to defendants’ pleadings were sustained. There is no question arising upon the pleadings of defendants except those so set out, and it is unnecessary to state such pleadings. The cause was tried before the judge without a jury. In the progress of the trial the plaintiff introduced G. A. Levi, who testified that he had been secretary of the meat company at Victoria and that H. C. Edrington was the secretary at Fort Worth; that he as such secretary received from Edrington a certificate or statement showing names of Fort Worth subscribers, amount subscribed, amount paid, number of certificate, number of shares and value; that this was sent for his use in issuing the stock; that Edrington wired him not to issue the stock, but send blank certificates to him (Edrington) and let him issue them. Plaintiff then offered the statement in evidence, for what purpose is not shown. It was signed “H. C. Edrington, Loc. Sec. and Treas.” Defendants objected to it, because its execution was not proved; it was hearsajq ex parte, and secondary. The execution of the paper having been shown, the court admitted it in evidence, and defendants excepted. Among the creditors for whose benefit the suit is brought are the New Orleans National Bank, the State National Bank of New Orleans, C. M. Soria, Adoue & Lobit, Fagan & Osgood, Osgood & Gray, Texas Continental Transportation Company, and Ayres & Cannon. The defendants attempted to show notice to each of these creditors of the agreement between the corporation and the stockholders for the taking of stock by the latter at less than par. The court below found that none of them had notice. A. Baldwin was president and William Palfrey cashier of the New Orleans National Bank, and I. H. Kennedy president of the State National Bank. It was shown that in the efforts of the promoters of the meat company to sell stock to Baldwin and Kennedy individually, each of them was informed of the fact in question a month or two before the credit was extended by their banks to the company. It is not made to appear how those debts were created, or that either Baldwin or Kennedy acted for the banks in creating the debts. It was also shown that a director of Baldwin’s bank was present when Baldwin received the information. Palfrey was also shown to have been informed of the nature of the subscriptions for less -than par value of stock, but whether before or after the debt to his bank originated does not appear. It was shown that Soria knew all about the terms upon which stock was issued before his claim against the company accrued, but how long before it is not shown; nor does it appear that his receiving knowledge had any connection with the extension of credit to the company, or was in such relation to it that he might be presumed to have remembered it when the debt was created. Adoue, of the firm of Adoue & Lobit, received information that stock had been sold at a discount before that firm credited the corporation. Their debt accrued in January, 1884, and the only date given when, Adoue received notice was in June, 1883, in an effort to sell to him, as an individual, stock in the compan)'. There was evidence vaguely tending to show notice to Fagan & Osgood, and Osgood of the firm of Osgood & Gray, but there is a conflict of evidence, and we conclude they had no notice. The Texas Continental Transportation Company was organized at the same time as the meat company, and the two companies were intended to and did work together. A. F. Higgs was president of the latter company and vice president of the former. D. M. Higgs, his brother, was president of the former company, and both knew all about the disposition made of the stock, and we conclude that the fair inference is that the transportation company had notice. It was shown that Ayres and Cannon both knew of the facts in question at the time they extended credit to the company. The court below found that none of these creditors had notice. The first conclusion of law of the court below was that the Fort Worth contract was executory, and that upon payment of the shares contracted for or any part of them the signer making it became a stockholder, whether certificates were issued or not; and that signers who failed to pay within the time fixed in the instrument were never stockholders, and not liable for the debts of the corporation. The second conclusion was that every stockholder who received shares at less than par value is liable for the difference between such value and the price paid, unless creditors had such knowledge as would charge them with express or implied assent to such sale. But for any debt created prior to such sale the subscriber was not liable. The third conclusion held that all the stockholders were properly joined in the suit. The fourth conclusion was that limitation had not run against creditors, and that the claims were conclusively established in the case of Ayres & Cannon against the company. , The fifth conclusion held that article 585, Revised Statutes, did not affect creditors with notice of sales below par of capital stock, and that the claims were conclusively established in the case of Ayres & Cannon against the meat company. The fifth conclusion holds that the notice to Kennedy and Baldwin did not amount to notice to the banks of which they were respectively president, and was not admissible against the banks. I. The first question for our consideration is whether the suit as brought could be maintained against all the defendants jointly in Victoria County. Viewing it as an original proceeding, the claim of jurisdiction in that court over the persons of the defendants who resided in other counties must be justified, if at all, under some provision of our statutes regulating the venue of suits. Undoubtedly the venue of all suits, whether legal or equitable in their character, is fixed by those provisions. The fourth subdivision of article 1198, Revised Statutes, in which is defined one of the exceptions to the general rule that defendants must be sued in the county of their residence declared by that article, provides that “ where there are two or more defendants residing in different counties, suit may be brought in any county where one of the defendants resides.” Some of the defendants here resided in Victoria County, and the inquiry resolves itself into the question whether or not those defendants who had their domiciles in other counties were necessary parties to the suit as brought; for unless they were they could not, if this be regarded as an independent suit, be sued away from their homes. Their subscriptions were several undertakings, and the rule which requires that joint obligors be sued jointly has no application. A bare action at law, either by the corporation or a creditor, to enforce the payment of a subscription of any one of them, could be brought only in the county of his residence. This suit, however, is not of that character. In its general structure and purpose it is an equitable proceeding in behalf of all the creditors of an insolvent corporation, after the appropriation of all its tangible assets to the debts, against subscribers to its capital stock, to have an accounting and a contribution from the defendants of such proportion of their unpaid subscriptions as might be found necessary to satisfy the debts. In this character of suit it is essential to the completeness of the remedy that the amount of the indebtedness of the corporation, the amount of unpaid stock in the aggregate, the amount due from each stockholder, and the proportion thereof necessary to discharge the debts, should be definitely and finally ascertained. It might also become necessary that the court ascertain who among the subscribers are solvent and who insolvent, in order that the solvent ones be required, as far as their subscriptions suffice, to contribute enough to make up the deficiencies arising from insolvency of the others. It is apparent, therefore, that in order to render certain and uniform justice to each creditor and each stockholder, they should all as far as practicable be brought into court. Accordingly we find the rule that equitable suits of this character must be brought by or for the benefit of all the creditors, and against all delinquent subscribers to the stock of the corporation who are solvent and within the jurisdiction of the court, so well established by authority that we need only to refer to some of them. Cook on Stock and Stockh., sec. 206, and note; 2 Mora. on Corp., sec. 897; Beach on Priv. Corp., sec. 700, and authorities cited. These authorities commend themselves to our judgment as being sound and as indicating the true doctrine on the subject. It certainly should be within the power of creditors of an insolvent corporation or their representatives pursuing the trust fund, which the law declares unpaid subscriptions to capital stock to be, to bring all the parties necessary to a full adjustment of their rights before the same court in one suit, and secure an adjudication which will settle all their rights and liabilities. The principles and practice of equity afford such a remedy, which in nowise conflicts with our statutes regulating venue, but is embraced within the scope of the fourth exception to article 1198. Authorities which maintain the right of a creditor to sue an individual stockholder to recover an unpaid subscription and apply it upon his debt do not conflict with the rule above laid down. In such suits an accounting and marshalling of assets and distribution of all the proceeds is not sought, but a single creditor seeks satisfaction for his debt out of the unpaid subscription of one stockholder. Some authorities deny his right to do so, and hold that the remedy in equity is exclusive. Others admit the right of the creditor to maintain such an action, but none of them in America, so far as we have examined, deny the right of all the creditors to join all delinquent members of the corporation in one proceeding such as that now before us. Some of them hold that the joining of all the stockholders from whom subscriptions are due is not essential; but others, and we think the better ones, hold that in so comprehensive a proceeding as a suit for an accounting and a determination of the pro rata part of the indebtedness which each subscriber shall pay, all must be joined, as far as known, unless they are insolvent or beyond the jurisdiction. The appellee contends, with much reason, that the power to bring before it delinquent subscribers to the stock of the corporation was involved in the jurisdiction acquired by the District Court of Victoria County over the corporation and its assets by the original suit for the appointment of a receiver and the administration of all the assets of the corporation for the benefit of its creditors. In view of the fact that the corporation was composed of its stockholders, and that they were, if they owed subscriptions, holders of assets which constituted in equity a trust fund for the payment of debts, and that some of them resided in Victoria County, we think the suit was properly brought there. From this it results that the court did not err in overruling appellant’s exception to the petition, nor in sustaining those of appellee to the answers asserting the privilege of defendants to be sued at their residence. It also follows that the exceptions to the petition on the ground of misjoinder of parties and causes of action were properly overruled. II. The next contention in the assignments and briefs is, that the receiver had no right to sue in his own name. The statute in force at the time of his appointment and when this suit was brought expressly authorized receivers to sue (Revised Statutes, article 1468), and he showed in his petition that he had been ordered to sue by the court. It is true that neither statute nor order in terms directed the suit in his own name. But the suit was one which the corporation by the agreements sued on was estopped from bringing, and it is difficult to see any reason why its name should be used when the cause of action asserted never accrued to it. We. understand both the order and the statute to authorize suits in the name of the receiver. Some authorities hold that unless a receiver is expressly authorized to sue in his own name, he can not, though authorized to prosecute a cause of action belonging to the party whose assets he holds, use his own name as plaintiff, but must use that of him to whom the right originally belonged. Others hold differently, and we think they are sustained by the stronger reason. High on Rec., 209, et seq. The law now in force expressly authorizes suits by a receiver in his own name. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 1464, III. The point is made by exceptions to the petition that the stock alleged to have been issued to defendants in excess of the price to be paid was void under article 12, section 6, of the Constitution, which provides, “ No corporation shall issue stock or bonds except for money paid, labor done, or property actually received, and all fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness shall be void,” and that therefore no liability on their part could grow out of it. The first clause of this provision prohibits the issuance of stock unless it has been paid for; the second renders void “all fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness.” The petition does not allege any fictitious increase of stock, but that the original stock was sold at less than par to the defendants, in violation of the rights of creditors. Stock issued and disposed of for a valid consideration is not fictitious within the provision quoted. The language is not that all stock sold for less than its face value shall be void, but .that “ all fictitious increase of stock shall be void.” In case of Stein v. Howard, 65 California, 617, an increase and sale by a corporation of its stock below par was held not to be fictitious under a constitution having the same provision. Peoria & Springfield Railway v. Thompson, 103 Illinois, 187, is another case which construes a constitutional provision very similar to our own. We see nothing in the provision in question which changes the rule long established by courts of equity that stockholders of a corporation are liable to the creditors for the par value of the capital stock subscribed for or held by them. IV. Several exceptions to the petition raise the question that it does not sufficiently show that the plaintiff is seeking to enforce the rights of creditors rather than those of the corporation against the defendants. The allegations of the petition plainly show that the suit is for the benefit of the creditors and asserts a cause of action which the company could not. We think also that the petition, as finally amended, was sufficiently specific in its allegations as to creditors. It was not necessaiy under the facts alleged to set out the cause of the action of the creditor against the corporation, as would be required in an original suit by the creditor, to establish it. The claims had all been established by the court in the receivership proceedings, and an allegation of that fact conclusively showed the liability of the corporation for them. This is an answer also to the claim of appellants that the claims of the creditors against the corporation were barred by limitation. V. Tfie original petition set up the same cause of action as that shown in the amended petition. In both the rights of creditors were asserted. The averments in the original petition were meager and defective, yet enough was stated to show the nature of the right asserted and that it was in behalf of creditors. VI. The special exceptions of the Fort Worth defendants, that the petition showed no performance of the conditions of the subscription contract, by alleging that the slaughter house had been erected and operated, the charter amended, and capital stock all paid or subscribed, were not well taken; nor was the exception, that the petition did not exclude the hypothesis that the defendants had elected to forfeit the amounts paid on stock and recede from the agreement to take stock, as they claimed the right to do under the contract. The petition did allege that the house was erected, equipped, and operated. The fact that the company was compelled by financial embarrassment to suspend the business certainly could not release stockholders from their obligations to creditors. They did not stipulate for a successful operation of the business for all time. It was not necessary to amend the charter in order to increase the number of directors. Rev. Stats., art. 575. That was done, and the objects of that provision in the contract attained. There was no stipulation in their contract that all of the capital stock provided for in the charter should be paid up or subscribed before liability should attach to them. They were bound for the stock they subscribed for, whether all of the remainder was ever taken or not. The contract gave to the subscribers no right of election to forfeit their payments and recede from the agreement or refuse to pay for the whole of the stock which they bound themselves to take. VII. The exception to the petition, that it did not allege the cost of building and equipping the slaughter house at Fort Worth, should have been sustained, because the amount of the liability of the Fort Worth subscribers depended on that fact. They did not, as we construe the contract, unconditionally agree to pay the amounts subscribed to the paper for stock at the price specified, but that they would pay those sums only in case half the cost of building, etc., should be equal to the amount subscribed. If one-half of such cost should be less than the amount subscribed, then they agreed to pay only such part of the latter amount as would be equal to half the cost. It may be' admitted that by their contract they became liable to creditors of the corporation for the full face value of such stock as they thereby subscribed for, and still the question would remain, what amount of stock did they agree to take ? They had the right to attach conditions to their subscriptions (Cook on Stock and Stockholders, 83), and this was clearly one by which the amount of money they were to pay and the amount of stock they were to receive was to be or might be limited. In setting out the contract and in failing to negative the hypothesis that half the cost of the building was less than the amount signed for, the petition left it uncertain what amount plaintiff was entitled to recover. It is true that there are general allegations that by the contract the defendants became liable for such amounts, but these were conclusions and not good against special exceptions. Vm. From what has been said concerning the overruling of exceptions to the petition, it will follow that there was no error in sustaining plaintiff’s exceptions to pleas of defendants presenting the same points as were involved in the exceptions. IX. The exceptions of plaintiff to the answers of some of the Victoria defendants, pleading, in setoff debts due to them from the company, were correctly sustained. Cook on Stock and Stockli., secs. 193, 227d. The eases referred to by appellants were suits by a creditor against an individual stockholder and not a suit in equity against all', and the distinction between the two proceedings is recognized in those cases. Mathez v. Neidig, 72 N. Y., 100; Garrison v. Howe, 17 N. Y., 458; Agate v. Sands, 73 N. Y., 620. X. There was no error in sustaining exceptions to the pleas setting up that the subscriptions of the Fort Worth defendants were obtained by fraudulent representations. Enough facts were not stated to make that a good defense against the corporation itself. But admitting that the facts, if timely set up, would have availed against the company, they could not be of any avail in this proceeding as a defense against creditors. Cook on Stock and Stockh., secs. 154-210, note 141; Knox v. Ogilvie, 22 How., 380. XI. The ruling sustaining exceptions to the plea of the Fort Worth defendants, setting up that they bought the stock contracted for by them from the residue of stock left on hand, and paid all they agreed to pay, was not erroneous. By this written contract they plainly agreed to take so much of the capital stock of the corporation as the sum for which they bound themselves would pay for, at a rate below the par value of the shares they were to get. This was an appropriation to them, by agreement between them and the corporation, of portions of the capital stock, the trust fund out of which the creditors had the right to seek satisfaction; and while it conferred upon them the right to the stock, as between them and the company, it also bound them to make good to creditors the amount called for by the stock whenever that might become necessary to pay the debts. The form of the contract between them and the corporation is immaterial. Equity looks at its substance and effect upon the rights of creditors; and thus regarded, it was only a subscription by them to the stock at a price below its par value. This was illegal as against the creditors. whom the -law will not allow to be deprived of the fund which it holds sacred for their satisfaction, by any device or contrivance of the corporation and the subscribers. Cook on Stock and Stockh., sec. 199; 1 Mora. on Corp., sec. 427; 2 Mora, on Corp., sec. 781; Upton v. Tribilcock, 91 U. S., 45; Tayl. on Corp., sec. 124. It is claimed that article 585, Revised Statutes, which provides that the directors may dispose of the residue of the capital stock at any time remaining unpaid, in such manner as the by-laws may prescribe, authorizes such a transaction as that in question, and relieves the subscribers from the operation of the rule we have just stated. There is no purpose shown here to authorize the directors to release subscribers to stock from their obligations to creditors. The directors are authorized to dispose of residue of stock in such manner as the by-laws may direct. It was not alleged that any by-law on the subject had been adopted, and for that reason the plea was defective. But a more direct and positive statutory provision than this must be shown to satisfy us of the legislative intent to authorize subscriptions to the capital stock of a corporation at less than its par value (as was this contract by its very terms) and a release of the subscribers from their liability to creditors. The charter fixed the capital stock, and the law gives it the effect that all of such stock should be paid up, if necessary to pay creditors. We can not see that, by the provisions quoted, the Legislature intended to authorize the by-laws of the corporation to change the effect of the charter, but only to regulate the disposition of the residue of stock in such manner as was consistent therewith. This disposes of the further contention of appellee that this statute put creditors upon such inquiry as would have affected them with notice of subscriptions to or sales of stock at a discount. , XII. The defendants’ plea of the statute of limitations can not avail them as a defense, and they were properly struck out on exceptions. No cause of action against the subscribers ever accrued to the creditors until they had exhausted their remedy against the corporation and had all of its property applied to their claims. The subscribers could not be called on to pay, and were not subject to suit, until it was established that the amount due from them was necessary to satisfy the indebtedness. The statutes of limitation were not applicable to the case. XIII. We think the certificate or statement of Edrington was hearsay, and that its admission in evidence was error. In the view we take of the case, however, this would not, alone, necessitate a reversal of the judgment. Several points are made upon the failure of the court below to find upon certain issues, as requested. In view of the disposition to be made of the case it will not be necessary to notice them further thaii they may be involved in the discussion of other questions. XIV. This brings us to a consideration of the points raised upon the conclusions of the court below. What we have already said sufficiently indicates our views as to the liability of the subscribers of the two contracts for the difference between the par value of the stock and the amount they agreed to pay for it. They are liable not only for the amount they agreed to pay, but for the full face value of the stock they subscribed for. In the case of the Fort Worth defendants this will depend upon the facts that may be alleged and shown as to the cost of building and equipping the slaughter house at Fort Worth, as explained above. The Victoria appellants claim that the court erred in fixing the liability of the Fort Worth defendants, in holding that they were to be treated as shareholders only from the time they made payments, and charged with the par value of stock only where they had made payment on their subscriptions. We think the position of the appellants is well taken. As before seen, the contract signed by the Fort Worth defendants was a subscription for such portion of the capital stock as would be taken by the amounts they agreed to pay at the rate specified. The error of the court in not sustaining exceptions to the petition as above pointed out would become immaterial as to the Fort Worth defendants by the judgment rendered, but this complaint of the Victoria defendants raises (as they have the right to do) the question as to the full liability under the Fort Worth contract, and that makes it necessary to go fully into that. It is not necessary that shares of stock should have been actually issued and delivered to any of the subscribers. Their subscription fixes their liability, though the issuance and acceptance of shares of stock would also fix liability for the full face value. XV. We think that the notice given to Baldwin and Kennedy, presidents of the banks, was not sufficient to charge the banks with notice of the arrangement between the corporation and its stockholders, in the absence of evidence that they acted for the banks in extending credit to the corporation at such time and under such circumstances as to authorize the inference that the knowledge formerly acquired in their individual transactions was still present before their minds. As the evidence stood, the court did not err in holding that it was not admissible against the banks. They might be shown to have received notice through their presidents, but this evidence did not go far enough. It may be said of the information to Adoue and Soria, that it is not so connected with the creation of their claims against the company that they should be held to have known it at that time. Parties engaged in business can not be required to store away in their memories all the facts which they learn, so as to be able to call them up at any time in the future, to affect other transactions than that in which the knowledge was acquired. Such information has not the characteristics of notice in law, unless the transaction to be affected thereby took place under such circumstances as would lead to the reasonable conclusion that the fact reported was still remembered. Ogden v. Hearn, 24 Ill., 60. The proof as stated in the record showed, as we conclude, that the Texas ■Continental Transportation Company and Ayres & Cannon had notice, and the court below should have so found; and so with the transportation company. The evidence on these points may be different on another trial, and we merely indicate our views as to the law applicable to the evidence, as we find it in the record. Delivered October 27, 1892. We think the court below was right in holding that creditors having notice at the time their claims arose, of the arrangement between the corporation and the subscribers, could not hold the latter responsible for more than they agreed to pay; and it necessarily resulted from this ruling that those of the Victoria stockholders who were also creditors of the corporation could not demand from the subscribers the difference between what they agreed to pay and the face of the stock. They could not therefore participate in the fund that was to be contributed by stockholders to pay creditors not having such notice. It appears, however, that some of the subscribers have never paid all they agreed to pay, and a recovery of that is sought in this case. That should when recovered constitute a fund for all of the creditors, whether with or without notice, for as to that creditors without notice have no priority over the others. We have found it impracticable to follow in our opinion all of the assignments of error in the several briefs of the parties in their order; but we believe it will be found that what is said above disposes of all the questions raised by any of them in this appeal. The assignments of the defendant Kempner raise the same questions as are discussed in connection with the contentions of the Fort Worth defendants. His case does not differ in principle from those of other subscribers. He took stock from the corporation at less than its face value, and must be held liable to creditors for the difference between that and the amount he paid. Because of the errors pointed out the judgment must be reversed; and inasmuch as the pleadings and evidence are not sufficient to enable us to determine the extent of the liability of the Fort Worth subscribers, it is not in our power to render a judgment here settling all the rights of the parties. The cause will therefore be remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. Reversed and remanded. Justice Pleasants did not sit in this case.","J. M. Mathis et al. v. F. R. Pridham, Receiver. No. 34. 1. Amendment not a New Cause of Action. — When a receiver sues all the stockholders of an insolvent corporation to recover of them the par value of stock purchased by them below par, for the benefit of creditors of the corporation, and alleges that he sues as receiver by virtue of the order of the court, sets up the total amount of the debts established against the corporation and the insolvency of the corporation, and the total amount to be realized in order to liquidate the debts, an amendment enlarging these allegations and setting up the date and amount of each debt which has been established against the corporation, with the name of each creditor, is not a new cause of action. 2. Venue in Suit by Receiver Against Stockholders. — Suit being instituted in Victoria County against the stockholders living there and those living elsewhere, if the others not living in that county were necessary parties to the suit they were properly sued there. In its general structure and purpose, this is an equitable proceeding in behalf of all the creditors of an insolvent corporation (after the appropriation of all of its tangible assets to the debts) against subscribers to its capital stock, to have an accounting and a contribution from the defendants of such proportion of their unpaid subscriptions as may be found necessary to satisfy the debts. It is essential to the completeness of the remedy that the amount of the indebtedness of the corporation, the amount due by each stockholder, and the proportion thereof necessary to discharge the debts, should be ascertained. Therefore, the other stockholders were necessary parties, and the venue was properly laid in Victoria County. 3. Solvency of Stockholders a Necessary Issue. — It is also necessary to ascertain who among the subscribers are solvent and who are insolvent, that the solvent ones may be required, as far as their subscriptions suffice, to contribute enough to make up the deficiencies arising from the insolvency of the others. 4. All Stockholders Necessary Parties. — In order to render certain and uniform justice to each creditor and each stockholder, they should all, as far as practicable, be brought into court. The suit should be for the benefit of all the creditors, and against all solvent delinquent subscribers who are within the jurisdiction of the court. 5. Same — One Sait Against all, Proper. — It should be within the power of creditors of an insolvent corporation, or their representatives pursuing the trust fund, to bring all parties necessary to a full adjustment of their rights before the same court in one suit. The principles and practice of equity afford such a remedy, which in nowise conflicts with our statutes, but is embraced within the scope of the fourth exception of article 1198, Revised Statutes. 6. Joinder of Parties. — The right of a creditor to sue an individual stockholder to recover an unpaid subscription and apply it upon his debt does not involve an accounting and marshalling of assets and distribution of all the proceeds. The authorities are in conflict as to his right to do so, but none of them deny the right of all the creditors to join all solvent delinquent stockholders within the jurisdiction of the court in one proceeding. 7. Misjoinder of Parties and Causes of Action — A suit by a receiver in behalf of all the creditors of an insolvent corporation, against all delinquent stockholders upon their contracts of subscription, setting up the amount of unpaid indebtedness and the amount due on each stock subscription, and praying for judgment against each defendant for such an amount as may be necessary to pay off the indebtedness of the insolvent corporation, is not a misjoinder of parties or causes of action, although the subscriptions to stock were made at different times and places, and the conditions attached to the subscriptions were not the same, and although the defenses urged by the various stockholders were different. 8. Receiver May Sue in His Own Name. — The corporation was es-topped by the agreement sued on from bringing this suit, and the order of the court and the law (Revised Statutes, article 1468) both authorizing suits by the receiver, he might sue in his own name, although neither the statute nor the order of court in express terms so directed. The law now in force expressly authorizes the receiver to sue in his own name. Sayles’ Civil Statutes, article 1464. 9. Stock Issued in ""Excess of Price Paid not Void. — Some of the defendants by their contracts were to receive $2 in stock for $1 paid, and others were to receive $85 of stock for every $60 paid. Article 12, section 6, of the Constitution, did not render the stock issued in excess of the price to be paid void. The first clause of this provision prohibits the issuance of stock unless it has been paid for; the second renders void all fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness. No fictitious increase of stock is alleged, but that the original stock was sold for less than parto defendants in violation of the rights of creditors. Stock issued and sold for a valid consideration is not fictitious within the provision quoted, nor void because sold for less than its par value. 10. Stockholders Liable to Creditors for Par Value. — Article 12. section 6, of the Constitution, does not change the rule long established by courts of equity, that stockholders of a corporation are liable to creditors for the par value of the capital stock subscribed for and held by them. 11. Creditors’Claims — Sufficient Consideration. — It was not necessary for the plaintiff to set out the cause of action of the creditors against the corporation with the same particularity as would be required in an original suit by the creditor against the corporation to establish it. The claims had all been established by the court in the receivership proceedings, and allegation of that fact conclusively showed the liability of the corporation for them. 12. Performance of Conditions. — Fort Worth stockholders subscribed to the stock upon the condition that the company should erect and operate as soon as possible, in or in the immediate vicinity of Fort Worth, a slaughter house of certain stated capacity. The petition alleged that the slaughter house was erected, equipped, and operated, and this was sufficient allegation of performance of this condition. The fact that the company was compelled hy financial embarrassments to suspend business did not release stockholders from their obligation to creditors. 13. Same — Increase of Directors. — A further section provided, that immediately after the acceptance of the subscription by thé company the charter should be so amended as to provide for thirteen directors, of whom six should be elected from the Fort Worth stockholders. It was not necessary to amend the charter in order to increase the number of the directors. Revised Statutes, article 575. That was done, and the object of that provision of the contract attained. 14. Construction of Contract. — Section 3 of the contract of stock subscription made with the Fort Worth stockholders provides, that they should not be entitled to any issue of stock until they had responded to each call to the amount of their respective subscriptions, and that if they should fail to pay any installment all previous payments should be forfeited; provided, however, that when their certificates of stock were issued their rights, duties, obligations, and privileges should relate back to the time of the acceptance of the offer. This contract gave the subscribers no right of election to forfeit their payments and recede from the agreement, or to refuse to pay for the whole stock which they bound themselves to take; and they were bound for the stock they subscribed for, whether all of the remainder was ever taken or not. 15. Same — Necessary Allegation and Proof. — The Fort Worth stockholders did not unconditionally agree to pay the amounts subscribed for stock at the prices specified, but that they would pay those amounts in case half the cost of building, etc., should be equal to the amount subscribed. If one-half of such cost should be less than the amount subscribed, then they agreed to pay only such part of the latter amount as would be equal to half the cost. Therefore, there should have been allegation and proof of the cost of building and equipping the slaughter house at Fort Worth. 16. Exceptions to Petition and Answer. — When the same points are presented in the exceptions to the petition as are raised by the exceptions to the answer, if defendant’s exceptions to the petition are overruled the exceptions to the answer are properly sustained. 17. Setoff to Suits for Stock Subscriptions. — Several of the defendants having pleaded in setoff debts which they alleged the corporation owed them for money advanced to it by them while operating its business, held, that plaintiff’s exceptions to this plea were properly sustained. This is not a suit by one creditor against an individual stockholder, but a suit in equity against all. There is a recognized distinction between the two classes of cases. 18. Procurement of Subscription by Fraudulent Representations. — Fort Worth stockholders allege that they were induced to subscribe to the capital stock by representations of the company that it would furnish half the money necessary to purchase, locate, and equip the Fort Worth slaughter house, which statements were untrue, and made to deceive, and did deceive. Held, of no avail in this proceeding as a defense against creditors. 19. Purchasers of Stock Below Par, Liability of. —Although the Fort Worth stockholders bought from the residue of the stock and paid all they agreed to pay, they purchased below par value, and thus appropriated a part of the capital stock which was the trust fund for the payment of creditors,' and it bound them to make good to the creditors the face value of the stock when it became necessary to pay debts. 20. Disposition of Unpaid Stock. — Article 505, Revised Statutes, authorizing directors to dispose of the residue of capital stock as the by-laws may direct, does not authorize the directors to release subscribers to stock from their obligation to creditors for par value thereof; nor does the statute put creditors upon such inquiry as would affect them with notice of subscriptions to or sales of stock at a discount. 21. Limitation. — Plea of the statute of limitations was properly stricken out. No cause of action against the subscribers ever accrued to the creditors until they had exhausted their remedy against the corporation and had all of its property applied to their claims. 22. Hearsay Evidence. — The secretary of the Victoria house received from the secretary of the Fort Worth house a statement showing names of Fort Worth subscribers, amount subscribed, amount paid, number of certificates, number of shares, and value. This paper held to be hearsay, and erroneously admitted in evidence. 23. When Shareholders Become Liable. — It is not necessary that shares of stock should have been actually issued and delivered to any of the subscribers to create a liability. Their subscription fixes their liability. Therefore it was error for the court below to hold that the Fort Worth defendants could be treated as shareholders only from the time they made payment, and that they could be charged with the par value of their stock only when they had made payment on their subscriptions. 24. Notice to Creditors of Sales Below Par.. —When creditors had notice when their debts were created of the arrangement between the corporation and the subscribers to its capital stock, by which they received it for less than par, they can not hold the subscribers for a greater sum than they agreed to pay. 25. What is Notice. — Notice to individuals who are presidents of banks which subsequently became creditors of the insolvent corporation is not sufficient to charge the banks with notice, in the absence of evidence that they acted for the banks in extending the credit to the corporation at such time and under such circumstances as to authorize the inference that the knowledge formerly acquired was still present before their minds. 26. Same. — Parties can not be required to store away in their minds all facts which they learn, so as to be able to call them up at any time in the future to affect other transactions than that in which the knowledge was acquired. Such information has not the characteristics of notice in law, unless the transaction affected thereby took place under such circumstances as would lead to the reasonable conclusion that the fact reported was still remembered. 27. Distribution of Proceeds — Where subscribers have not paid all they agreed to pay for their stock, that, when recovered, should constitute a fund for all the creditors, whether with or without notice, for as to that fund creditors without notice have no priority over others. Appeal from Victoria. Tried below before Hon. H. Clay Pleasants. The opinion states the case. Glass, Callender & Proctor, for appellants J. M. Mathis, T. P. McCampbell et al., Victoria stockholders. Venue. 1. The court erred in overruling the exception of each of these defendants to the jurisdiction of the court over him, because it appears by plaintiff’s petition that none of these defendants resided in Victoria County, and the petition showed no grounds authorizing suit to be instituted against them in Victoria county. 2. As to the defendants Ed. Power and Wm. Albrecht, whose subscriptions were $500 each, and Ralph Welder, whose subscription was $250, the court had no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit (Const., art. 5, sec. 16), and this objection could not be waived nor cured by consent. Rev. Stats., art. 1198; Lindheim v. Muschamp, 72 Texas, 33; Holloway v. Blum, 60 Texas, 625; Cohen v. Munson, 59 Texas, 236. 3. The court erred in overruling the first special exception in the several answers and amended answers of these defendants excepting to the plaintiff’s petition, because the receiver sues in his own name and it does not appear that he had authority to bring this suit in his own name. High on Rec., sec. 209. Misjoinder. 1. The court erred in overruling the second special exception in said answers excepting to plaintiff’s petition, because the suit is brought against all the defendants, and no joint obligation or joint liability of the defendant is set out or alleged; but, on the contrary, said petition alleges a separate demand against each defendant. There are in all about seventy individuals and ten or twelve firms made defendants, and in each case the allegation is that the individual or the firm owes so much as a balance due and unpaid upon stock issued to the individual or to the firm for less than par value. 2. The right of each defendant to be sued alone upon a separate demand is something more than a mere technical right. It is a material right, and the denial of it in this case works a hardship. For example, here are judgments against Ed. Power and William Albrecht for $400 each. They may be, and. we believe they are, not only erroneous but absolutely void for want of jurisdiction in the court over the subject matter. But the claims against these defendants'are so joined and complicated with the claims against seventy or eighty other defendants, and the record is so encumbered and swollen by the proceedings in regard to all the defendants, that neither of them could have the judgment against him revised by the Supreme Court without incurring an expense for the trans-script alone greater than the amount of the judgment against him. Rev. Stats., arts. 604, 608; Bank v. Sachtleben, 67 Texas, 421; Jones v. Bank, 10 Col., 464. 3. The court erred in overruling the fourth special exception of said answers, excepting in substance to plaintiff’s petition because it sought to recover from each defendant for the value of stock alleged to be issued to him in excess of the stock for which the money subscribed by him would pay at par value, which was excepted to on the ground that such excess of stock if issued was illegal and void, and conferred no rights and imposed no liabilities. Const. 1876, art. 12, sec. 6; Scovil v. Thayer, 105 U. S., 143. 4. The plaintiff’s petition showed no cause of action against the defendants, because it contained no averment of the real value of the stock issued or sold to them, nor that it was of any greater value than the price defendants paid for it. Fogg v. Blair, 139 U. S., 118. 5. Whatever might be the right of creditors of the corporation or of the receiver, if he sued as representative of creditors and properly alleged causes of action in their behalf, the corporation itself is estopped, and the receiver, suing as the representative of the corporation, is also estopped, to claim anything from the stockholders for stock which was issued at an agreed price less than par, and which agreed price has been fully paid. Cook on Stock and Stockh., sec. 38b; Id., sec. 208; Scovil v. Thayer, 105 U. S., 153, 154; Billings v. Robertson, 28 Hun, 122. 6. A receiver invested with general authority to collect all funds out of which the creditors of a corporation are entitled to be paid, is always entitled to recover assets which belong to the corporation; but in order to recover funds which the corporation itself could not recover he must show that he represents creditors who have an equitable right to be paid out of these funds. Mora. on Corp., see. 868, par. 3; High on Rec., sec. 201. 7. The allowance by the receiver and auditor in the case of Ayres & Cannon et al. v. The Texas Continental Meat Company, of the claims of creditors against said company presented in said suit, and the approval of said claims made by the court in said suit, could not bind the stockholders to pay said claims out of funds which were not assets of said company, and which the company itself could not recover from these defendants. High on Rec., sec. 315, and note 1; Cook on Stock and Stockh., sec. 42, and note 3. 8. When the receiver of a corporation sues its stockholders to compel them to pay creditors out of funds which the corporation could not recover, he must show what creditors he represents and the nature of their claims, and that they have an equitable right to be paid out of such funds; and it follows that the stockholders have the right to contest such claims. High on Rec., sec. 201; Mora. on Corp., sec. 868. Notice. 1. The court erred in holding that notice to A. Baldwin, president of the New Orleans National Bank, was not notice to said bank, because the knowledge which constituted the notice was not acquired while he was engaged in transacting the business of the bank. Knowledge in the mind of the president of the bank that the stock of the meat company had been issued for less than par was notice of that fact to the board of directors over which he presided when they discounted the paper of that company or otherwise extended credit to it, because it was the duty of the president to communicate that knowledge to the board, and the law presumes he did communicate it; and the fact that he acquired his knowledge while transacting his private business does not change his duty or the effect of his knowledge upon the bank. There is abundant authority that notice to the cashier of a bank is notice to the bank, and on this point we refer the court to the note in 36 American Decisions, page 198, where many cases are cited. But all the authorities, we believe, on this subject lead to the principles declared by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in Factor’s Company v. Marine Dry Dock Company, 31 Louisiana Annual, 149, “A corporation can not see or know anything except by the eyes or intelligence of its officers,” and that “ Wherever knowledge in any form will suffice, a corporation must be held to know what its president and chief officers know.” Distilled Spirits Case, 11 Wall., 356, 366, 368; Factor’s Co. v. Dock Co., 31 La. Ann., 149; Bank v. Canal Co., 4 Paige, 127; Smith v. Bank, 32 Vt., 341; Tagg v. Bank, 9 Heisk., 479; Bank v. Campbell, 4 Humph., 396; Bank v. Cushman, 121 Mass., 490; Green v. Ins. Co., 10 Pick., 402; Mora. on Corp., secs. 540b, 540c; Pars. on Part., 196, 197; 5 Wait’s Act. and Def., 451; Willis v. Green, 5 Hill, 232; Bank v. Root, 4 Cow., 126. 2. The court erred in the first conclusion of law, “ That the contract between the corporation and the persons signing the instrument of writing set out in the petition herein, and bearing date the 14th day of August, 1883, was an executory contract, and that when the shares of stock contracted for, or any number of these shares, were paid for in accordance with the terms of the contract, such signer of said instrument became eo instante a stockholder, whether certificates of stock were issued to him or not, and that such of the signers of said paper who failed to pay for any stock within the time prescribed by the instrument were never shareholders and can not be held liable for the debts of the corporation under any circumstances.” The court erred in the fifth conclusion of law in holding that the statutes of Texas authorizing the directors of a corporation to sell the stock of the company in accordance with its by-laws, does not put creditors of the corporation on inquiry as to whether the stock has been taken at less than its par value; and erred in holding that the charter of a corporation fixes the value of its stock. Rev. Stats., arts. 581, 585; Mora. on Corp., secs. 591, 592. Setoff. The court erred in sustaining exceptions to the several pleas of setoff made by certain of these defendants. Morton v. Gordon, Dall., 396; Lang v. Dougherty, 74 Texas, 226, 232; Eborn v. Cannon, 32 Texas, 231, 249; Mora. on Corp., sec. 787, last par.; Garrison v. Howe, 17 N. Y., 458; Mathey v. Neidig, 72 N. Y., 100; Agate v. Sands, 73 N. Y., 620; 14 Am. and Eng. Ency. Law, 295, 296, 301, 302. Scott & Levi, also for appellants. Hunter & Stewart; Hunter, Stewart & Dunklin; Hogsett & Green; Hogsett, Green & Humphreys, for appellants S. G. Jennings, J. P. Smith et al., Fort Worth stockholders. Jurisdiction. 1. The court erred in overruling the defendant’s exception to the jurisdiction of the court over the persons of these defendants, because plaintiff’s petition showed that said defendants resided at the institution of this suit in Tarrant County, Texas, and said petition shows no grounds for jurisdiction over said defendants in Victoria County. Masterson v. Cundiff, 58 Texas, 472; Parker v. Foster, 3 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 305; Thomp. on Lia. of Stockh., sec. 114; Mora. on Corp., 1 ed., sec. 269. 2. That the corporation is being wound up by a legal representative would not change the rights of the signers to the contract or give the court winding up the same jurisdiction over the persons of said signers. Holloway v. Blum, 60 Texas, 629; Cohen v. Munson, 59 Texas, 236; Roan v. Raymond, 15 Texas, 85. Fraudulent Representations. 1. If one is induced to subscribe to the capital stock of any corporation by false and fraudulent representations made to him by the promoters of such corporation, such subscriber can avoid his liability by establishing that he was induced so to do. This rule applies even to original subscribers of stock. But where the corporation is already formed and organized, and seeks to dispose of the residue of its capital stock, and in order to induce men to purchase same its officers and agents sent out by it to sell said stock make false and fraudulent representations concerning the profitableness of its business and financial condition, tending to establish a high value of said stock, and thereby induce men to purchase the same or to enter into a contract for the purchase of the same, such purchaser may avoid his liability and refuse to pay for said stock or accept the same by establishing that he was so induced to enter into said contract. And this rule would apply as well in defense of the action brought by the receiver of said corporation as if brought by the corporation itself. Cook on Stockh., secs. 140, 147, 148, 150, 152, 350, note 5. 2. A stockholder can make same defense at suit of receiver as he could make at suit of corporation. High on Rec., sec. 205, note 1; Cook on Stockh., sec. 208; 1 West. Rep., 161; 33 Barb., 610; 23 N. J. L., 283. 3. The court erred in sustaining the plaintiff’s special exception to •defendants’ answer, setting up full payment of the amount of money by him agreed to be paid for shares of capital stock in the Texas Continental Meat Company, because the facts therein pleaded as to said payment are in law and in equity a complete and proper defense to plaintiff’s cause of action to the payment of the number of dollars agreed to be paid to extinguish its obligation. Rev. Stats., art. 585; Stein v. Howard, 6 Am. and Eng. Corp. Cases, 514; Const., sec. 6, art. 12; Mora. on Corp., secs. 61 (note 5), 69, 110, 118, 225, 226. Shares are personal property. Rev., Stats., art. 590. The right of the corporation to sell its stock at less than par can not be questioned by subsequent creditors. Graham v. Railway, 102 U. S., 148. Notice. The court erred in that conclusion of fact wherein he finds that Baldwin & Co. and such of the stockholders of the corporation as were creditors were the only creditors who had notice at the time they extended credit to said company that the stock of the corporation had been issued to shareholders for less than its par value. Notice to the president or cashier of a national bank is notice to the bank. Notice to one member of a firm or copartnership is notice to the firm; and any information on the subject upon which notice is predicated that would put an ordinarily prudent person upon injury, which if followed up would lead to the knowledge of the facts, would be notice in law. Rev. Stats., art. 585; Morse on Banks, 125, 127, 129-131; Wade on Law of Notice, secs. 675, 687, 689; Wait on Insolv. Corp., sec. 496. Liability. 1. The court erred in his conclusion of law wherein he holds that every stockholder of a company who received its stock at a price less than its par value as fixed by the charter is in equity liable to the extent of the difference between the price paid for the stock and its par value, for any debt incurred by the corporation subsequent to the purchase of the stock, unless the creditor at the time of extending credit to the corporation had such knowledge of such sales of the stock of the company as would charge the creditors with the express or implied assent to such sale; because the law is well settled that the corporation, after organization, if all of its capital stock has not been subscribed for, may by an order of its board of directors dispose of the residue of its stock in such manner and at such price, terms, and conditions as its board of directors may deem proper. Rev. Stats., art. 585; 1 Mora. on Corp., secs. 61, 110, 118, 225, 286-292; 2 Mora. on Corp., secs. 829, 830, 831, note 1; Paper Co. v. Waples, 3 Wood, 34; Wait on Insolv. Corp., secs. 87, 102; Handley v. Stutz, 139 U. S., 417; Clark v. Sever, 139 U. S., 96; Fogg v. Blair, 139 U. S., 118; 6 Am. and Eng. Corp. Cases, 514; 82 N. Y., 535; 59 Md., 1. 2. Neither the District Court of Victoria County nor any other court has power by its orders, upon the motion of creditors or anybody else, either in law or equity, to change the rights, liabilities, and obligations of a party to any contract so as to make the liability joint when the parties have made it several, or take from any resident of this State the right and privilege of being sued in the county of his residence; and the conclusion of the court affirming such a doctrine is error. High on Rec., sec. 205, note 1; Cook on Stockh., sec. 208; 1 West. Rep., 161; 33 Barb., 610; 23 N. J. L., 283. Henry J. Labatt, for appellant H. Kempner, adopts briefs of other appellants and makes the following additional point: The court erred in rendering judgment against this defendant for the amount of said judgment, because it appears from the evidence this defendant purchased the stock standing in his name in open market from others, and did not subscribe for the same to the corporation, but paid its then full market value. Mora. on Corp., secs. 834, 836. Proctor & Proctor, for appellee, F. R. Pridham, receiver. Venue. 1. This suit is such an ancillary proceeding as is contemplated by article 595, Revised Statutes, and as such was properly instituted in the District Court of Victoria County against all appellants. But whether it be precisely the ancillary statutory proceeding or not, it is an ancillary equitable remedy, plainly concurrent with any statutory one and in no sense excluded thereby. 2 Mora. on Corp., 866, 867, 896; 55 Am. Dec., 77, note; Cook on Stockh., 204; Wait on Insolv. Corp., 156; Smith v. Huckabee, 53 Ala., 196. 2. It was the court’s duty in the original suit to direct the receiver of this insolvent corporation to make ratable assessment upon the stockholders for the amount of unpaid capital stock necessary to pay creditors. The court had already jurisdiction over the matter of this call. The present suit is only the receiver’s assessment of the stockholders. 2 Mora. Corp., 822. 3. Even if this be considered a proceeding independent entirely of-said original suit, yet, nevertheless, in a suit of this nature all the stockholders should be made parties, and ordinarily the corporation also. Without the presence of all the stockholders a complete adjustment of all the rights and liabilities of the stockholders is impossible. The corporation in this particular suit was not a necessary party, for said indebtedness to creditors had been previously established by another adjudication. 2 Mora. Corp., 822; Cook on Stockh., 206b; Pome. Rem., 486-490; Calv. on Parties, 10, 11. 4. The grand principle which underlies the doctrine of equity in respect to parties is, that every judicial controversy should if possible be ended in one litigation, so that the decree in the single suit should determine all rights, interests, and claims, should ascertain and define all conflicting relations, and should forever settle all questions pertaining to the subject matter. Pome. Rem., 247; 1 Pome. Eq. Jur., 141; Bank v. Investment Co., 74 Texas, 433; Clegg v. Varnell, 18 Texas, 294. The point at issue is one of common interest to all parties to the suit; and even granting that the interests of the several defendants were otherwise unconnected, yet they should be joined. Pome. Rem., 527-532; Calv. on Parties, 5-11. 5. If the object of the suit is single, but it happens that different persons have separate interests arising out of the single object, it necessarily happens that all such different persons must be brought before the court in order that the suit may conclude the whole matter. Salvidge v. Hyde, 5 Madd. Ch., 138; Boyd v. Hart, 5 Paige, 38; 5 Dan. Ch. Pl., 386; 1 Story Eq. Pl., 531, 532. Limitation. Certain objections of limitation of two and four years are urged against said indebtedness ab initio, and also against the enforcement of said indebtedness in the present proceeding. Certainly all this indebtedness, having been fixed by decree of court as against the corporation, is res-adjudícala as to the shareholders. If any of said claims were barred when approved in original suit, and the corporation failed to make proper defense, it was said shareholders’ province to have done so in said original suit. But now these claims are safe from collateral attack. Cook on Stockh., 209; 2 Mora. on Corp., 886. Now as to the statute of limitation as against the enforcement of these valid demands upon this unpaid subscription fund: In the first place, we question whether the statute can be invoked by appellants, for the reason that this right to have capital stock paid up is a “ continuing subsisting trust and confidence to which the statute has no application.” Payne v. Bullard, 23 Miss., 88. Granting, however, that it has place in a proceeding of this nature, yet it certainly could begin to run only from time of the receiver’s demand, i. e., the inauguration of this suit (Cook on Stockholders, 195), since which time there have been pending legal proceedings to collect same. Stock Value. 1. The charter of a corporation fixes the value of its stock so far as creditors are concerned. The capital stock as fixed by the charter is the trust fund for creditors. This is the distinctively American rule. Bank v. Investment Co., 74 Texas, 437; 2 Mora. on Corp., 780, 781, 826; Cook on Stockh., 42f, 46b; 1 Laws. Rights and Rem., 495; Wait on Insolv. Corp., 142-146; Scovill v. Thayer, 105 U. S., 143; Sawyer v. Upton, 91 U. S., 56; Chubb v. Upton, 95 U. S., 666; Pullman v. Upton, 96 U. S., 328; Hawley v. Upton, 102 U. S., 314; Sawyer v. Hoag, 17 Wall., 610-620; Flinn v. Bayley, 7 Fed. Rep., 785; Fogg v. Blair, 25 Am, Law Rev.; Ins. Co. v. Mfg. Co., 97 Ill., 537; Northrop v. Bushnell, 38 Conn., 498; Fisher v. Seligman, 7 Mo., 383; Sagory v. Dubois, 3 Sand. Ch., 466-499; Kehler v. Ladman, 11 Mo. App., 550. 2. It is only where a creditor give scredit to a corporation knowing that its capital stock, had not been fully paid up, but had been declared paid up for the purpose of releasing shareholders from further liability to creditors, that such creditor has no equity to insist upon said capital stock being fully paid up in its face value. Simple knowledge on the part of a creditor that corporate shares have been issued for less than their par value in no sense affects any right of said creditor. Knowledge that the purpose of the corporation in such issuance is to release shareholders from further liability to creditors is the keystone of the rule. 2 Mora. on Corp., 829. There is a clear distinction between knowledge acquired by an agent and notice given the agent with specific design of notifying the principal. Only the former, if anything, is present in this case. 2 Mora. on Corp., 540b; Bisph. Prin. Eq., 325. The general rule on this subject of knowledge on the part of the agent being constructive notice to the principal is, that the information constituting the notice must be obtained by or imparted to the agent while he is actually engaged in transacting business for his principal. It is further an element of this general rule that the knowledge must come in the course of the same transaction from which the principal’s rights and liabilities arise, which it is claimed depend upon or are modified by the constructive notice. Upon this general rule there has been placed by a strong line of authorities an important and well settled limitation, namely: Where the transaction in question closely follows and is intimately connected with a prior transaction in which the agent was also engaged, and in which he acquired material information, or where it is clear from the evidence that the information obtained by the agent in a former transaction was so precise and definite that it is or must be present to his mind and memory while engaged in the second transaction, then the requisite as to notice in the same transaction becomes inapplicable, and. the information acquired by the agent operates as constructive notice to the principal in the second transaction, although the principal was a stranger to prior business. But this limitation must be qualified as follows: If the agent acquired the information while acting for his principal and in the very same transaction, then it is conclusively presumed that he retains said information present in his mind and memory during the entire conduct of said transaction, and the principal is charged with constructive notice. But if the agent acquired the information in a former and independent transaction, then it is prima facie presumed that he does not retain same in his mind and memory in the subsequent transaction on behalf of a principal, and prima facie there is no notice to said principal. This presumption may be overcome by evidence, but the proof must be clear. 2 Pome. Eq., 670, 671, 672, and cases cited; Constant v. Univ. Rochester, 111 N. Y., 604; Distilled Spirits, 11 Wall., 356; Fuller v. Bennett, 2 Hare, 394. Taking up the question of knowledge on the part of the agent constituting constructive notice to the principal, we submit that the weight of text book authority is with the absolute proposition that the knowledge must come to the agent while acting for the principal. 2 Mora. Corp., 540b; 1 Am. and Eng. Ency. Law, 419; Taylor on Corp., 210; Ang. & Ames on Corp., 305; Bisph. Prin. Eq., 387; Pars, on Part., 196, 197; Sovy v. State, 41 N. J. L., 394. Where the knowledge comes to the agent, not only while not acting for his principal, but actually while acting in his own private interests, the presumption is yet stronger that same is not retained in his mind and memory while acting in a subsequent transaction for his principal. Brass Co. v. Glass Co., 37 Mo. App., 145; Savings Assn. v. Printing Co., 25 Mo. App., 642; McCormick v. Wheeler, 36 Ill., 114; 2 Pome. Eq., 117. Setoff. It is a general rule that a holder of claims against an insolvent corporation can not set them off against his liability for an assessment on his stock in the corporation to pay creditors.

The defendants, as stockholders, were already parties in court when the receiver was appointed, or when the judgment of Ayres & Cannon was rendered.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. It is recited in the statement of facts, that a judgment was rendered November 8, 1887, by the District Court for Grayson County, Texas, in a suit in said court of N. & J. Baxter against the heirs of Montgomery Baxter, deceased, by which the land in controversy was set apart in partition to the heirs of Lucy Armstrong, and authorized the issuance of execution in favor of the officers of court against each party for his proportion of the costs of the-suit, according to the amount of land received by each; said judgment showing upon its face that the defendants in said suits were cited by publication, and nowhere showing that they had appeared and answered either in person or by attorney.” It was admitted that both parties claimed title under the heirs of Lucy Armstrong as a common source. We are not informed by the record whether, at the time of the rendition of the judgment above referred to, the heirs of Lucy Armstrong were citizens of this State and their residence unknown, or whether they were nonresidents. Appellant claims the land in controversy under a sale by virtue of an execution issued upon this judgment in favor of 1 ‘ The Officers of Court v. The Heirs of Lucy Armstrong ’ ’ for their part of the costs incurred in that case. Appellees claim as the heirs of Lucy Armstrong, and as such recovered in the court below; and by reason of the condition of the record as above indicated, they have appeared in this court and confessed error in the judgment, and ask that the cause be remanded to enable them to produce evidence to show that by the record in the case in which that judgment was rendered it appears that the heirs of Lucy Armstrong were at that time citizens of the State of Missouri. Appellant objects to our remanding the cause, and insists that such judgment should be here rendered as should have been rendered by the court below. That a judgment for costs in a proceeding of this kind is in personam, and can not be sustained upon service by publication where the defendants are nonresidents, is settled by the decisions in this State. Foote v. Sewall, 81 Texas, 659. It seems also to be settled in this State, that unless it be made to affirmatively appear that the defendants in a suit by publication are nonresidents at the time of such service, this will not be presumed; but on the contrary, it will be presumed that they were citizens of this State, and the judgment valid. Martin v. Burns, 80 Texas, 676, and authorities there cited. We are therefore of opinion that the court below probably erred in holding the judgment upon its face to be a nullity; but inasmuch as the court did so hold, we think the proper practice, as indicated by the decisions of our Supreme Court, will be to remand the cause to enable the parties to show the real facts, instead of for us to undertake to here render such judgment as we would be required to render, taking the record as disclosing all of the evidence that could be produced by the parties. In the case of Rust v. Burke, Turner & Co., 57 Texas, 341, one of the parties was undertaking to plead in setoff a judgment in his favor against the other, which seems to have been disallowed upon the ground that an appeal had been taken from the judgment. In passing upon the question of practice in such cases, Associate Justice Stay ton, delivering the opinion of the court, says: “The record shows that notice of appeal was given in the case of Taylor v. George & Zorn, but does not show that an appeal was ever perfected. This fact can not be presumed, and it must be held to be a subsisting judgment until the contrary is shown. The judgment offered in evidence by Rust in setoff amounted to more than the note sued upon, and judgment should have been rendered in favor of appellant, and ordinarily judgment in such case would be here rendered as the court below should have done; but as it appears that notice of appeal was given in the case of Taylor v. George & Zorn, the judgment will therefore be reversed and the cause remanded that appellees may have an opportunity to show, if they can, that that judgment has been set aside.” In McConnell v. Wall, 67 Texas, 352, it seems that the case had been before the court at a former term, and was reversed and remanded, with instructions to the court below to ascertain only one fact, and then enter a judgment in accordance with the opinion then rendered. It was admitted in the court below that this fact was such as to entitle the appellee to a judgment under the opinion, but appellant insisted upon opening the whole case and having a trial by a jury, which was refused; and Justice Stay ton, in delivering the opinion, says: “The court below did not misunderstand the former judgment of this court, and correctly refused to reopen the entire case. If the appellant was of the opinion when the judgment of this court was entered at the last term that on another trial lie could make proof that would show Ms right to be other than by the record it then appeared, he should have asked this court so to reform its judgment as to give him an opportunity to do so. This he did not do.” In this case appellees make such request. Also see a similar practice indicated in the case of the Merchants and Planters Bank v. Thomas & Sons, 69 Texas, 237, and in Clark v. Cummings, 84 Texas, 610. The statute governing the practice in this court in such cases is the ■same as that heretofore regulating the practice in the Supreme Court, and is as follows: “ When the judgment or decree of the court below shall be reversed, the court shall proceed to render such judgment or decree as the court below should have rendered, except when it is necessary that some matter of fact be ascertained, or the damage to be assessed or the matter to be decreed is uncertain, in either of which cases the cause shall be remanded for a new trial in the court below.” It will be observed, that the defect in this record is in its failure to ascertain whether the heirs of Lucy Armstrong were residents or nonresidents of this State at the time of the service by publication upon them. If this fact had been ascertained in the court below and properly appeared in the record, our duty would be to affirm or reverse and render the judgment, as the facts of the case might require; but not having been ascertained, we think this should be done before the court attempts to render a judgment final upon the rights of the parties. We believe such to be the practice adopted by our Supreme Court under a similar statute, and that it will more conduce to attaining the ends of justice than a harsher rule. We are more inclined to adopt this course in this case from the fact that we entertain serious doubts as to whether or not this judgment should be reversed at all upon the record as presented to us. It will be seen, that the judgment, as appears from the record, seems to have been against the heirs of Lucy Armstrong, not against her unknown heirs. We have a statute recognizing such proceedings against unknown heirs, but none against heirs as such, whose names are known but not given. The court below found against the validity of this judgment; and to sustain its finding, might we not be required to presume that this judgm'ent, when introduced in evidence in the court below, did not appear to have been rendered in a proceeding under the statute above indicated, and was therefore unauthorized? The execution issued upon this judgment also seems to have been against the heirs of Lucy Armstrong, and not against her unknown heirs; and we are not now prepared to hold, that if we were required to pass upon the record as presented to us, we would be called upon to overrule the court below in refusing to sustain a sale under these proceedings. But these questions not having been presented by counsel, we render no decision thereon, and only allude to them in support of our action in remanding the cause to enable both parties to present the case to the court below upon a fuller statement of the facts as they exist. In justice to the learned judge who presided at the trial in the court below, we will add, that as appears from an affidavit on file, he was of the impression that the pleadings in the case in which the judgment in question was rendered were considered in evidence, and that these disclosed the nonresidence of the defendants therein. The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 2, 1893.","Jot Gunter v. John Armstrong et al. No. 405. 1. Judgment for Costs against Nonresident Cited by Publication—Presumption from Record.—A judgment for costs against nonresident defendants cited by publication can not be sustained; but unless it affirmatively appears from the record that the defendants were nonresidents, it will be presumed that they were citizens of this State, and the judgment valid. 2. Practice on Appeal—Cause Remanded for New Trial, When. Appellant's title, which was by virtue of a sale under an execution issued for costs against defendants cited by publication, was held void by the trial court; but the record on this appeal fails to show whether such defendants in the former suit were residents or nonresidents when so cited therein. Appellees confess error, and ask that the appellate court, instead of rendering such judgment as could be required by the record before it, remand the cause in order that on another trial they may show hy the record in the former suit that the defendants therein were then nonresidents.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This suit was brought by appellant against appellee, to recover an amount alleged to be due as freight upon certain narrow guage cars transported over appellant’s road for appellee, and alleged to have been taken by appellee from appellant’s possession by force, without paying the charges for such transportation. The machinery was shipped by the Lima Machine Works, of Lima, Ohio, consigned to appellant at Groveton, Texas, under a bill of lading issued by the Lake Erie & Western Railway Company, at the former place, in which the cars were described as “ narrow guage cars for use on steam railroad,” and the charge for carriage was stipulated at 53 cents per 100 pounds. There were joint tariff rates fixed between the Lake Erie & Western Railroad and appellant and connecting lines, regularly scheduled, posted, and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, in accordance with the act of Congress known as “ The Interstate Commerce Law,” in which such freight was divided into two classes, one including “ narrow, guage cars for use upon steam railroads,” upon which the charge for carriage was fixed at 53 cents per 100 pounds, and the other including k k cars, logging, narrow guage,” on which the charge was 84 cents per 100 pounds. The first class was intended to embrace such cars as were carried for steam railroads engaged in the carrying business, and the other was intended to describe the same kind of cars when they were to be used on tram roads operated in connection with saw mills. Appellee was not engaged in the carrying business, and was not operating a steam railroad further than that its cars were hauled over a tram, used in connection with its saw mill, by steam engines; and for this use the cars were intended. The. freight in this case, therefore, actually belonged to the last named class, while it was described in the bill of lading as belonging to the first. This came about through the action of the machine works from which appellee purchased, whose clerk had the property loaded upon a car of the receiving railroad at Lima, and presented to its agent a shipping order and a bill of lading for signature, with the property thus designated in both. The carrier’s agent signed the bill of lading without seeing the property and supposing it to be correctly classed. The machine company’s agent knew of the different rates arising from the classification above stated, and represented to the carrying agent that the cars were for use on a narrow guage steam railway. The error was discovered while the car was in transit, by the authorities of an intermediate line, and a corrected way bill was issued to accompany it, stating the freight charges at 84 cents per 100 pounds; and the car, accompanied by this bill, reached appellant’s line at Trinity, and its agent there paid the portion of the freight due the connecting lines according to the 84 cents rate, and forwarded the car to appellee at Groveton. Appellee then tendered to appellant the charges due, according to the bill of lading, and, upon its refusal to accept same, took the property from its possession without its consent. It cost as much to transport such cars for use upon railways as for use in connection with saw mills, and the difference in favor of the former was made because they were public carriers, created business and an interchange of traffic, only compensatory and not remunerative rates being fixed for them. There was no evidence that the higher rate was unreasonable, unless it consists in the difference between the two rates. The finding of the court below, that appellant was restricted in its recovery to the amount stated in the bill of lading, under the facts of this case, was error. Such instruments, it is true, in general are contracts binding on the carrier, and fixing the remuneration which it is entitled to recover for its service. But here the rate was obtained by a misrepresentation of appellee’s agent as to the class to which the freight belonged. There is no conflict of evidence on this point; and whether this was done innocently or not, on the part of the clerk of the machine works, the result is the same. It constitutes in law a fraud, of which appellee can not reap the benefit. There is no doubt, however, that the correspondence between appellee and the machine works discloses the use for which the former ordered the cars, and that the latter knew of the difference between the rates fixed for the two classes of matter, and designated the cars in the bill of lading so as to secure the lowest rate. The testimony of the clerk who made the shipment discloses these facts. The act of Congress regulating commerce between the States requires carriers engaged in such traffic to establish and publish schedules of rates,fares, and charges; and makes it unlawful for any such carrier to charge, demand, collect, or receive any greater or less compensation for transportation than is specified in such schedules. Act 1887, sec. 6; amended Act 1889, sec. 6. Appellant and its connecting lines over which the property in question passed had complied with this law, and the classification and charges, about which this controversy arose, were contained in the joint tariff published by them and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. Had they, therefore, knowingly entered into the contract in question, whereby less compensation was charged than was specified in their schedules, they would have been guilty of a violation of that law, and would have incurred severe penalties. Id., sec. 10. And appellant, if it had knowingly collected different rates from those fixed in the schedule, would have been equally guilty as if it had originally made the contract. The same law also prohibits unjust discriminations and the making of unreasonable charges, and appellee contends that the difference between rates allowed carriers and those charged against other shippers constituted an unjust discrimination which would preclude the recovery of the higher rate. But the law does not provide that an unjust discrimination shall have the effect of limiting the carrier to the lowest rate charged. The effect of the different requirements seems to be, that the carrier is bound to schedule its rates, and to fix them at reasonable figures, without unjust discriminations. It is held to the rates established, and can discriminate or charge unreasonable compensation only at the peril of criminal prosecution. If it discriminates unjustly, or charges unreasonable rates, it can be punished by criminal proceedings, and the party injured has his remedy in the courts, by which the carrier can be restricted to such remuneration as is just, and can be held responsible for such damages as its wrongful conduct has occasioned. But the carrier, in dealing with shippers, is required to conform its charges against them to the rates fixed in the published tariff, and can not lawfully depart therefrom. If such charges are unreasonable, the shipper has his remedy. But the mere fact that a less rate is allowed to one class of shippers, for special reasons applicable only to them, than is applied to all others, is not made proof that the rate charged generally is unreasonable. Delivered December 15, 1892. The only evidence in the case on the subject is furnished by appellants, and tends to show that the rate charged railways is less than should be charged shippers generally, and that the higher rate is reasonable. Whether or not it is lawful for carriers to make this difference we do not find it necessary to decide. For if it be unlawful, appellant would still be entitled to reasonable remuneration, and this, we have seen, according to the only evidence, is the higher rate. If there was unjust discrimination, and the contract with appellee was therefore unlawful, it is not seen how that can aid it. It claims under the contract, indeed procured it through misrepresentation made to the railway company, by those whose acts must be charged to it, and to permit it to establish the illegality of the contract, and at the same time receive the benefit of it, would be absurd. The judgment of the court below will be reversed and judgment rendered in this court for appellant for the sum of 8282.65, with interest from July 1, 1889, the date when the goods were tendered to appellee at Groveton, and all costs of suit. Reversed and rendered.","Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company v. Trinity County Lumber Company. No. 35. 1. Shipper and Consignee. — If a shipper, acting as the agent of the consignee, fraudulently misclassifi.es freight, the carrier may recover of the consignee a rate of freight according to a correct classification. 2. Classification of Freight — Misrepresentation in Procuring Bill of Lading. — The Lima Machine Works constructed and shipped to appellee cars described in the bill of lading as “ narrow gauge cars for use on steam railroad.” In accordance with the interstate commerce law, joint tariff rates had been fixed between the road that issued the bill of lading and its connecting lines, in which such freight was divided into two classes, “narrow gauge cars for use on steam railroads,” and “ cars, logging, narrow gauge.” The first class embraced cars carried for roads engaged in the carrying business, and the rate of freight was 53 cents per 100 pounds. The second included cars for use on saw mill tram roads, and the rate of freight was 84 cents per 100 pounds. The clerk of the machine works presented to the receiving road a shipping order and bill of lading, in which the cars were designated as “ for use on steam railroads,” and they were both signed. The machine company knew of the different rates arising from the classification. Upon arrival appellee tendered the freight charges according to his bill of lading, and upon appellant's refusal to receive it, took possession without consent. . Held, the rate of 53 cents was obtained by a misrepresentation of appellee’s agent, and constitutes a fraud, of which appellees can not obtain the benefit, and payment of the 84 cents rate was enforced. 3. Interstate Commerce. — The act of Congress regulating commerce between the States requires carriers engaged in such traffic to establish and publish a schedule of rates, and makes it unlawful for any carrier to charge, demand, or collect any greater or less compensation for transportation than specified. Had appellant and connecting lines knowingly entered into the contract in question, whereby less was charged than specified, they would have incurred severe penalties; and if appellant had collected different rates from those specified, it would have been as guilty as if it had made the contract. 4. Discrimination in Freights. — The same law forbids discriminations, but does not provide that an unjust discrimination shall have the effect of limiting the carrier to the lowest rate charged. The carrier must schedule its rates, and can discriminate only at the peril of criminal prosecution, and the party injured may restrict the carrier to just remuneration, and hold it responsible for damages for its wrongful conduct: but the mere fact that a less rate is allowed to one class of shippers than to another is not proof that the rate charged is unreasonable. 5. Reasonable Remuneration. — Whether or not it is lawful for carriers to make this difference we do not find it necessary to decide. If it be unlawful, appellant would still be entitled to reasonable remuneration, and this, according to the only evidence in this case, is the higher rate; and the judgment is reversed and rendered for appellant.

It would be unjust and illegal discrimination, both under the laws of Texas and the interstate commerce act, to allow a carrier to collect a greater rate for the same kind of freight from one person or class of persons than from another person or class. Discrimination based upon the mere use to which freight is to be applied, or even for the private benefit of the carrier, is unjust and illegal. Railway v. Gallaher, 79 Texas, 685; Reynolds v.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. The judgment appealed from in this case declares the existence of a lien in favor of appellee on a certain tract of land therein described, ordering the sale of the same, to secure the payment of the following debts in the following order: First. The note of one Fleming, without security. Second. Two notes of said Fleming, with O’Neill and others as sureties on one, and Silberberg & Patton as sureties on the other (against which sureties judgment was also rendered). Third. A certain indebtedness of said Fleming, paid by appellant and others as his sureties. The record contains conclusions of law and fact and a statement of facts. The sixth finding of fact, that the note upon which Silberberg & Patton were sureties was secured by a lien on said land, appears to be unsustained by the statement of facts. This probaby resulted from an oversight in making up the statement of facts. If appellant had definitely assigned error upon the failure of the statement of facts to sustain the sixth finding of fact (of which he complains in his brief under a rather general assignment), it would have become necessary to either reform the judgment or remand the cause for a new trial, provided the appeal had been perfected so as to give this court jurisdiction. The appeal bond is payable to the Red River County Bank alone. It thus appears that the interests of Silberberg & Patton might be affected by the judgment to be entered on this appeal, without their being before the court as parties to the appeal. Their interests, as well as the interests of O’Neil and others, are adverse to the interests of appellant to the extent of the priority of their several liens. The appeal must therefore be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Young v. Russell, 60 Texas, 684, and cases there cited. Dismissed. Delivered January 3, 1892. A motion for rehearing was refused.","S.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the District Court of Grayson County, whereby the appellees, Curtis Carlton, Rosa Carlton, and Ernest Carlton, recovered certain realty, situated in the ■ city of Denison, from the appellants, J. K. Miller and James N. Miller, father and son. The verdict of the jury indicates that they so interpreted the evidence (conflicting in some of its aspects) as to justify, if not to require from us, the following conclusions of fact: On January 17, 1877, J. K. Miller sold and conveyed the lot or block of land in controversjr to Lazarus W. Carlton and his wife, Mollie Carlton, the parents of the appellees herein, who were minors when this suit was instituted. The vendees, L. W. Carlton and his wife, paid a portion of the consideration of this property at the time of the purchase, the remainder being represented by a purchase money note for the sum of 8292, besides interest, maturing January 1, 1878, and retaining the vendor’s lien. They also, to secure the deferred payment, executed a deed in trust upon the property to one W. B. Munson, as trustee. They took possession of the property and occupied it as a homestead until L. W. Carlton died in 1879, and after that date the widow, Mollie Carlton, with her children, the appellees herein, continued to occupy it as her homestead until in December, 1882, when she intermarried with one William Shockley. January 3, 1881, the appellant J. K. Miller brought suit in the District Court of Grayson County against Mollie Carlton, surviving wife of L. W. Carlton, and against Curtis, Rosa, and Ernest Carlton, his children, to recover the amount due upon the purchase money note and to foreclose upon the property in question the vendor’s lien retained in the note. After the institution of the suit, J. K. Miller agreed with Mrs. Carlton, that if she would deliver to him possession of the premises referred to, he would rent the same out and would apply the proceeds of the lease to the payment of the note, and that he would not prosecute to judgment the suit already brought by him, though it was to remain on the docket; and that when the rent would have paid off the note he would redeliver the premises, to Mrs. Carlton. With this understanding she surrendered to him possession of the property. This agreement with reference to the application of the rent he seems to have carried out until March, 1883. In the meanwhile the suit was dismissed February 12, 1882, for want of prosecution. On December 12, 1882, it was reinstated. On March 5, 1883, J. K. Miller filed an amended petition, making William Shockley a party defendant. Miller, on May 19, 1883, in violation of his agreement, took judgment by default for the unpaid balance of the note, with an order declaring a foreclosure of the lien upon the property and decreeing the sale thereof. In accordance with this decree, an order of sale was, on January 29, 1883, issued, and the property was sold on the first Tuesday in August, 1883, and the deed executed by the sheriff to the purchaser, J. K. Miller, which was by him filed for record on August 7, 1883. J. K. Miller and his wife conveyed the property to James N. Miller by deed dated January 22, 1884, and recorded on May 12, 1884. This conveyance was without consideration, the grantor testifying that it was intended as a deed of gift. The rental value of the property while it was in the possession of the defendants exceeded the amount of the purchase money note. Mrs. Shockley, formerly Mrs. Carlton, died in February, 1884. This suit was .instituted August 6, 1889. We regard this proceeding as an invocation of the equitable powers of the court, whereby it is sought to have the property, the apparent title to which is in the defendants, charged in their hands with a trust for the plaintiffs equitably entitled to it. The plaintiffs’ petition, while it does not in terms charge fraud on the part of the defendant J. K. Miller, in obtaining the judgment and the sale already referred to, yet avers facts from which the conclusion of fraud inevitably follows. The court below therefore correctly, as we think, overruled the contention of appellants, urged there and persistently reasserted here, that this proceeding is a collateral attack upon the judgment of a court of general jurisdiction, to be deemed conclusive against the claim by plaintiffs to the property involved. The judgment of the District Court of Grayson County which declared the lien and ordered the sale of the “property remains undisturbed. On account, however, of the fact, that in securing the sale of the property and the consequent investiture of title in himself, the defendant J. K. Miller availed himself of an agreement (whether intentionally fraudulent it is not necessary to consider), by which he lulled into passiveness appellees and their mother, he should be decreed to hold the title thus obtained subject to and in trust for their recognized rights. By means of this judgment, obtained under such circumstances, and of the sale resulting therefrom, equity can not be thwarted in the discharge of a task peculiar to it, of averting the consequences of fraud, actual or constructive. The doctrine here applied is not believed by us to conflict with that which holds the judgment of a court of general jurisdiction unassailable collaterally. The judgments of Probate Courts, which in matters pertaining to their jurisdiction are courts of equal dignity with our District Courts acting with reference to subjects within their cognizance, have been several times thus interpreted. Martin v. Robinson, 67 Texas, 369; Fisher v. Wood, 65 Texas, 204; Storer v. Lane, 1 Texas Civ. App., 250. While the decrees themselves have been declared unimpaired, the titles thereunder acquired, resting upon fraudulent devices antedating the decrees, have been charged with a trust for the benefit of the victims of these devices. As James N. Miller, the remaining defendant, obtained the property without consideration from his father, he occupies, with reference to the assertion of his rights, the same attitude as the latter. The appellants complain of the refusal of the trial court to give a special instruction requested by them upon the plea of limitations. This instruction embraced two clauses. The first clause was erroneous, because it did not limit the period of adverse possession to five years before the institution of the suit, but extended it to the time of the trial. Besides, as requested, it could not have benefited appellants, as it was not to apply if the appellees were minors, and their minority was undisputed. The second clause was erroneous, because it was made to rest upon the alleged fact, that at sometime during the period of the defendants’ possession the mother of the plaintiff was a widow, whereas the evidence showed that during that period she was constantly under coverture. The testimony, except perhaps as to Mrs. Carlton’s half-interest, presented no aspect under which the statute could be invoked by the defendants; and to that phase the requested instruction was not sufficient even to invite the attention of the court. The charge was properly refused. We do not concur with appellants, that the verdict of the jury finding the agreement on the part of J. K. Miller, already recited in our conclusions of fact, is contrary to the evidence. The evidence was so conflicting on this question as to be sufficient to support a finding of the jury, whether for or against the defendants. Having thus, as we think, sufficiently disposed of all the questions raised in appellants’ brief, we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed. It is so ordered. Affirmed.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This is a suit by J. T. Brackenridge, the appellee, against Martin McCarty and his wife Josephine McCarty, on a promissory note for $2500 and interest, and to foreclose a lien on parts of lots 7 and 8 in block 122 in the city of Austin, and the improvements thereon. The petition alleges that the plaintiff is the owner and the holder of the note; and besides many explanatory allegations concerning the execution of the note and the transaction between Brackenridge and McCarty creating the alleged lien, the petition is in the usual form. The following are the conclusions of fact and law filed by the presiding judge, upon which judgment was rendered for plaintiff according to the prayer in the petition, from which McCarty and his wife have appealed: Findings of Fact. 1. That prior to August 1, 1883, defendant Martin McCarty and Page McDannell were partners, engaged in the wholesale liquor business in Austin, Texas, and that on or about said first day of August they by mutual consent dissolved said partnership, and by the terms of said dissolution said McCarty agreed to pay all the liabilities of the partnership, amounting to about $17,000, and he took the stock and fixtures, worth about $22,000, and continued the business. 2. That a short time before said dissolution of said partnership said McCarty and his wife sold their homestead in Austin, Texas, to G-. W. Littlefield for $10,000, and said McCarty had received as part payment therefor said Littlefield’s purchase money note for $5000, which was valuable commercial paper. 3. That at the time of the dissolution of said partnership said McCarty agreed with said McDannell that after paying off the balance due on the homestead sold to Littlefield, he would use the remainder of the proceeds of the sale in his business to protect McDannell against his liability on said $17,000 firm indebtedness. 4. That about the time of said dissolution of partnership McCarty contracted for the purchase of the property in controversy from T. J. Moore and wife, of San Antonio, Texas, acting by their agent, M. B. Sweeney, in Austin, Texas, for $2500. 5. That after said dissolution, and before the consummation of said purchase, said McDannell objected to McCarty investing any of his means in a homestead until he had paid off the liabilities of said firm which he had assumed; whereupon McCarty and plaintiff entered into the followingparol agreement, to-wit: That McCarty should temporarily withdraw $2500 from his business and pay Moore and wife for the property, and have them make a deed to plaintiff, conveying the property to him, and that after thirty days from that time plaintiff would on demand advance to McCarty $2500 to replace the amount so withdrawn from his business, and that said deed was to be delivered to plaintiff, and he was to hold the deed to said property and have a lien thereon until McCarty repaid him the $2500 and interest, when he was to convey to McCarty. 6. That said McCarty’s business was in such a condition that he could not have permanently withdrawn the $2500 to pay for the property from his business without endangering the success of his said business and impairing his commercial standing; and the agreement he made with the plaintiff, as hereinbefore stated, enabled him to procure said property, subject to plaintiff’s lien thereon, without such results following. '7. That on August 1, 1883, in pursuance of the aforesaid contract of sale between Moore and wife and McCarty, Moore and wife executed and had properly acknowledged a deed conveying said property to said McCarty, which, on the 3rd day of August, 1883, was by said T. J. Moore delivered to McCarty in said McCarty’s office in Austin, Texas, and said McCarty then and there paid said Moore for said property the sum of $2500 in cash, which he had just received from J. II. Raymond & Co.’s bank by discounting the aforesaid Littlefield note for $5000. 8. That said McCarty, soon after receiving said deed from Moore and wife to him, delivered the same to M. B. Sweeney, with instructions to return it to said Moore and wife and get them to execute another in lieu thereof, conveying the property to plaintiff; which was done, and on the seventh day of August, 1883, said Moore and wife executed and had properly acknowledged a deed conveying said property to plaintiff, which they returned and caused to be delivered to said Sweeney, and which, about the middle of said month, was delivered to plaintiff and was duly recorded in the land records of Travis County. 9. That on the 24th day of August, 1883, plaintiff made the following endorsement on said deed: ‘ ‘ Know a,ll men by these presents, that Justin McCarty has on this 24th day of August paid me $2600, for which 1 am to make him a deed to the within property whenever he desires, and in the meantime this can be used as a basis of credit in the First National Bank for $2000, all expenses of making deed and acknowledging, etc., to be paid by McCarty. “ J. T. Brackenridge.” This endorsement was not a contract or agreement between plaintiff and McCarty, but was a voluntary statement in writing made by the plaintiff for the protection of McCarty in the event of plaintiff’s death before McCarty got the $2500 as agreed upon to replace the money withdrawn from his business to pay for said property, but McCarty knew this endorsement was on the deed before he got the money. 10. That on the 18th day of September, 1883, McCarty called on the plaintiff for the §2500 in pursuance of the parol agreement, and plaintiff caused the same to be paid to him by the First National Bank of Austin, which he used in his business. 11. That at the time of the receipt of the said §2500 as aforesaid said McCarty executed his promissory note for same, payable to said First National Bank, of which plaintiff was and is now president, with 12 percent interest and 10 per cent attorney fees, etc., which note was renewed for the same amount and on substantially the same terms November 20, 1883, and March 24, 1884. On January 27, 1887, the note of March 24, 1884, was renewed for same amount, payable thirty days after date, with same interest, etc., and made payable to J. T. Brackenridge, president, at the First National Bank, Austin, Texas. The first of these notes has this statement in it: ‘1 Deed for lot where I live collateral security.” The last note, January 27, 1887, contains this statement: “ Purchase money for house and lot now occupied by Dr. Weisselberg, in the city of Austin, Travis County, Texas.” It was shown by proof that when the first note was executed McCarty resided on the property in controversy, and when the last note was made Dr. Weisselberg, as McCarty’s tenant, resided upon it. 12. That as between plaintiff and said bank, of whose board of directors plaintiff was and is president, it was understood that said agreement between him and McCarty was his individual transaction, and he is liable to said bank for said $2500. 13. That plaintiff had no notice of the execution or delivery of the deed from Moore and wife to McCarty until after the latter failed in business in February, 1887, and he let McCarty have the $2500 in good faith, believing from McCarty’s statements and acts that the deed from Moore and wife to him was the only one they had executed to convey said property, but he did have notice that they were purchasing said property for a homestead, and that they were occupying it when he let McCarty have the money. 14. The defendants took possession of the property in controversy about the 1st of September, 1883, and were occupying it as a home when plaintiff paid McCarty the $2500, and have so continued to occupy it most of the time since then; but defendant Martin McCarty did not claim it as a homestead as against plaintiff’s said debt until after his failure in business in February, 1887. 15. The defendant Josephine McCarty had no knowledge of said transaction between plaintiff and her husband, and of the deed being made by Moore and wife to plaintiff, until after her husband’s failure in business, but thought the property had been deeded to her said husband, and she has claimed it all the time as her homestead, and does so now. Conclusions of Law. 1. That plaintiff is entitled to judgment against defendant Martin McCarty for $2500, with 12 per cent interest thereon from the-day of-, 1887, to date, and 10 per cent as attorney fees on the first amount, and for costs. 2. That the deed from Moore and wife to Martin McCarty, as against the rights of plaintiff under the contract made with said McCarty, was and is inoperative, and can not be made the basis of defendants’ homestead rights, because plaintiff furnished the $2500, believing from the acts and representations of said McCarty that the title to said property had been conveyed from said Moore and wife to him, and without any notice of the execution of said deed to McCarty. 3. That defendants can not, as against plaintiff’s right under said contract and agreement with Martin McCarty, assert homestead right under the deed to plaintiff, because the effect of said agreement was to subrogate plaintiff to the rights of a vendor of the premises. 4. It is therefore held that plaintiff has a lien on said premises to secure payment of said money, paramount to the homestead rights of defendants, and judgment will be rendered against said Martin McCarty as aforesaid, and against both defendants, foreclosing said lien on said property. Appellants’ first assignment of error is: “The court erred in the fifth paragraph of the facts found by the court, in finding that plaintiff and the defendant Martin McCarty made a parol agreement before the consummation of the purchase of the property in controversy by said McCarty from T. J. Moore and wife, by the terms of which said McCarty was to temporarily withdraw from his business the $2500 to pay Moore and wife for the property and cause Moore and wife to make a deed conveying the property to plaintiff, and that after thirty days from that time plaintiff would advance to said McCarty $2500 to replace the amount so withdrawn from his business, and that said deed was to be delivered to plaintiff, who was to hold the deed to said property and have a lien thereon until said McCarty should repay the amount with interest, when he was to convey it to McCarty; because the great preponderance of the testimony and circumstances in this case show that no such agreement ever existed between plaintiff and defendant, and show that if any such agreement ever did exist it was changed to another and entirely different agreement before any money was advanced to defendant.” In treating the foregoing assignment we will discuss several of the principal questions presented in the record. Under the view we take of the case the court below found the material facts to be determined, and was correct in finding that the money, $2500, was furnished by plaintiff under the agreement as found by the court and not under any change of agreement. It occurs to us that the first and most important question in the case is as to the time the parol agreement was made before the payment to Moore by McCarty, and before the delivery of the deed to McCarty, or, as expressed in the court’s finding, before the consummation of the purchase by McCarty. A reference to some of the testimony will show that it supports the finding. Page McDannell says the sale of the property by McCarty and wife (their old home) to Littlefield was taken into consideration when witness (who was the former partner of McCarty in the wholesale liquor business) sold out his interest in the business. The agreement between him and witness was that the proceeds of the property, sold to Littlefield were to be used in the business. McCarty assumed the debts, about $17,000, upon dissolution, but McDannell was bound for them. The stock was worth about $22,000. After selling out to McCarty, McDannell says he found out that he was about to buy another place, which would at once become a homestead. Witness went right to him and objected to his taking the money out of his business until the firm’s indebtedness was settled. McCarty told witness that he had gone so far he did not see how he could help it; had contracted for the property and was expecting the deed every day. Witness suggested that the deed be returned and another deed by Moore and wife be made to plaintiff. McCarty made no objection, and said he would do it. Witness then hunted up plaintiff, told him what the object was and all about it, when plaintiff and witness went to McCarty’s store and plaintiff talked to McCarty. As McCarty had already said he would fix it up that way, the witness considered his object accomplished, and left and did not know how it was fixed up. The witness does not give the date of this transaction, but says it was very soon after the dissolution, which was. on August 1; could not state the day of the month. He says McCarty is mistaken in saying that he had the deed when witness went to him; that he has the dates confounded; that it would have been nonsense to advise him to have the deed made to Brackenridge if it had been already received and the money paid. Brackenridge is not certain when he had the first conversation with McCarty about the trade; says it was about the 1st of August. They did not agree on that day. McCarty wished Brackenridge to take the property, which the latter declined to do. He says: “I think probably I saw him again the next day, and it was probably three days afterward that he saw me in the bank. What he wanted there was merely to consummate the agreement before made. He wanted to know what I would do for him certainly, and I told him I would take the deed myself for the property from Moore and wife, and hold it and wait on him for the purchase money; that if he was compelled to take the money out of his business I would wait on him as the vendor of the property. That was the second or third time he came to see me. There had then been an agreement between us. At the second interview I had an agreement with him about the same thing. He said he had a contract with Moore and wife for the property, a house and lot; that he would be compelled to take and pay for it, but that under his agreement with McDannell he could hot pay for it; that it would cripple him in his business, and he wanted me to furnish him relief and assist him.” The contract or agreement is then stated by the witness. By reference to other transactions, he fixes the time for the contract on the 1st of August, 1883. The testimony shows that the Moore deed to McCarty was executed in San Antonio, and Moore came with it to Austin on the 3rd of August, 1883. The trade had been negotiated by M. B. Sweeney, a land agent. Sweeney testified that Dr. Moore came to Austin on the 2nd or 3rd of August, 1883, and was in his office about 10 a. m. Moore told him he had come to close the trade. He, Sweeney, left Moore in his office and went to see McCarty. When he informed McCarty that ‘ ‘ Dr. Moore was here ready to close the trade,” he, McCarty, was standing at the desk and seemed a little confused. He said, “ I am not ready.” “ Well,” I said,11 Mac., you had better see to this. ’ ’ Witness went back to his office and told Moore what McCarty said; when Moore requested witness to tell McCarty that the trade had to be closed that day or he would take the property off the market and not sell it at the price; witness went to McCarty and delivered the message, when McCarty said he would see what he could do. Witness returned to his office; and while going to McCarty’s store the third time he met McCarty. * * * I said, “ Mac., have you made it ?’ ’ He answered, 11 Major Brackenride has agreed to let me have the money to pay for the place; a better friend I never had,” etc. The witness then proceeds to narrate the subsequent facts of the payment of the $2500 to Moore when the deed was delivered to McCarty, and says: “At the time of the sale, as my memory serves me pretty strongly, McCarty left the deed in my office, and told me the deed was to be made to Major Brackenridge. So I retained the deed, copied it, inserted Major Brackenridge’s name, and sent it to Dr. Moore to sign.” Witness is certain, by reference to the entry of his commissions on the trade, that the money was paid and the deed delivered on the 3rd of August. Afterward the deed from Moore and wife to Brackenridge came back from San Antonio to .1. W. Robertson; it was delivered by him to Sweeney, who delivered it to Brackenridge. McCarty is positive in his testimony that the first deed was delivered to him on the third of August, and that he made the agreement with Bracken-ridge on the sixth; says it was August 6 he handed the deed back to Sweeney with instructions to have a new deed made to Brackenridge, and thinks it was the ninth the second deed came back. It was dated August 7. We have reviewed this testimony at some length, as the question raised by it is of more importance to the decision of the case than other findings of the court upon the facts. We conclude that the testimony warranted the court in finding that the agreement with plaintiff and McCarty was made before the purchase money was paid to Moore, and before the deed was delivered to McCarty. It was upon the agreement as found by the court that Bracken-ridge furnished the money to McCarty for which the latter executed his note for the amount, $2500, tó the First National Bank, of which plaintiff was and is the president. The note is dated the 18th of September, 1883, and the other notes, including the one sued on, are renewals of the first. The last note is of date January 27, 1887, and states upon its face that it is “ purchase money for house and lot now occupied by Dr. Weisselberg in the city of Austin,” etc., which is the same conveyed by Moore and wife. The first note was due sixty days after date, and before the signature contains the following: “ Deed for lot where I live collateral security.” At this date McCarty was living on the place, having moved upon it on the 11th of September, 1883. He purchased the property for a home, but could not obtain possession until the 11th of September, it being occupied by a tenant. Brackenridge knew nothing of the deed to McCarty at the time he advanced the money. His and McCarty’s agreement was that he was to hold the deed made to him, not as a deed of conveyance, but as a lien on the house and lot to secure the payment of the amount to be advanced by him, and when McCarty repaid him he was to convey the property to him. Construing the transaction as found by the court, the deed to McCarty ■encumbered the property with a parol trust as expressed in the agreement. The legal effect of the transaction was as if the deed had been at first made by Moore and wife to Brackenridge to take effect as a mortgage for the security of the purchase money, upon the payment of which Bracken-ridge was bound to convey to McCarty the property. The withdrawal of the money from his business by McCarty, under the circumstances of his agreement with McDannell and the condition of his business., was a sufficient consideration to bind Brackenridge to furnish the money. The agreement to make the mortgage was valid and enforceable; the money was furnished by Brackenridge, a performance that consummated all prior agreements and gave them vitality from the beginning. Hicks v. Morris, 57 Texas, 658. The sending of the first deed back to Moore after its delivery, and having one executed to Brackenridge, was but a compliance with a legal agreement made with him before the first deed was delivered. A parol agreement may be made to execute a mortgage in the future, where the agreement is supported by a valuable consideration, and the agreement itself will be treated as a mortgage in a court of equity. The question of homestead does not embarrass the case or interfere with the contract. The husband can encumber the homestead in the acquisition of it, and homestead rights will not obtain so long as the encumbrance remains. The husband can renew the encumbrance or change it at discretion, so he does not defraud the wife. Farmer v. Simpson, 6 Texas, 304; Morris v. Geisecke, 60 Texas, 635; White v. Shepperd, 16 Texas, 163; Clements v. Lacy, 51 Texas, 150; Gillum v. Collier, 53 Texas, 592; De Bruhl v. Maas, 54 Texas, 464. A mere lender of money for the purpose of buying a homestead has no lien unless there was at the time an agreement to that effect. Euhl v. Kauffman, 65 Texas, 723. In the case at bar there was an agreement for lien, which must be discharged before a homestead can be acquired against it. The foregoing disposes of the important issue in the case, but others must be considered. We do not think, as insisted in the second assignment of error, that the sixth finding of fact by the court was unsupported by the evidence. The evidence warranted the conclusion that McCarty’s business was in such condition that he could not have permanently withdrawn therefrom the $2500 without endangering its success and impairing his commercial standing. McCarty substantially so represented the facts to Brackenridge in negotiating the agreement for the loan. His agreement with his partner, and the interview between them upon this subject, also supports the finding. It is also true, as found by the court, that the agreement with the plaintiff enabled him to procure the purchase money for the house and lot without injury to his business. Appellants contend that the court committed error in finding that the endorsement of Brackenridge on the deed to him was not a contract with McCarty, but a voluntary statement made for the protection of McCarty in case of the death of Brackenridge before the money was furnished as per agreement. The deed was left with plaintiff before the money was drawn, and there was nothing to show the nature of the transaction and McCarty’s interest in the property. Brackenridge did not know of the former deed to McCarty. Brackenridge fully explained the meaning of the endorsement — that it was for McCarty’s protection in case he should die; that McCarty would be entitled to a conveyance of the property from him if he did not draw the money to replace in his business. Evidently the statement that McCarty had deposited with Brackenridge or paid him $2500 was a fiction, but it would afford a consideration and a good reason for a reconveyance of the property to McCarty by Bracken-ridge’s representatives in case of his death. In other words, it indicated that McCarty was entitled to a conveyance unless he used the credit provided for in the memorandum. The fourth assignment complains of error in the court’s finding that McCarty, on the 18th of September, called upon plaintiff for the $2500 in pursuance of the parol agreement; that plaintiff caused it to be paid to him by the First National Bank, and that defendant used it in his business. The finding is in accord with the testimony. The note was made payable to the bank, but Brackenridge was bound to the bank for the amount, and it was regarded as his obligation by him and the bank authorities. This view of the case is consistent with the facts indicating the very contract with all the parties, and it is so stated by direct testimony. The bank did not loan any money to McCarty. Brackenridge was personally responsible, and he and the bank so regarded it. He was regarded as the owner of the note and its security. It may be as well to say now, in anticipation of the assignment of error, that the legal conclusion to be derived from the facts so found constituted Brackenridge the real owner of the note and the beneficiary of the security. The suit was properly so brought, and sustained by the testimony. Either the legal or equitable owner may maintain an action on a promissory note. Butler v. Robertson, 11 Texas, 142. The bank and Brackenridge could have any understanding as to the liability and ownership that suited them, without violating any right of MeCarty. But it is undoubtedly true that McCarty under the facts was liable to Backenridge, and the latter had a good cause.of action against him, as made in the petition and by the proof. Delivered October 19, 1892. There are many assignments of error in the able brief of counsel for appellant directed to the issues discussed in the foregoing, but they are all comprehended in what we have said, and disposed of adversely to the appellant. AH' the finding's of the court below are supported by the evidence and are sufficient to warrant the judgment of the court. It ought to be affirmed, and it is ordered. Affirmed. Justice Key did not sit in this case.","Martin McCarty and Wife v. T. J. Brackenridge. No. 6. 1. Parol Agreement as to Conditions of Purchase of Land. — McCarty and Brackenridge agreed in parol that Brackenridge would furnish McCarty money to buy a house and lot to be used as a homestead, but the deed was to be taken in name of Brackenridge, to hold the land as security and until the money advanced should be paid. The agreement being upon valuable consideration, affected the land; although the deed first taken was executed to McCarty, and by him surrendered and a second obtained from the vendors to Brackenridge, who knew nothing of the first deed. 2. Consideration. — McCarty was in business and in straightened circumstances. He wished to buy a homestead, but could not withdraw money wherewith to buy from his business. He agreed with B. that the deed for property paid for with money taken from his business should be executed to B. upon his furnishing money to replace the money so used. Such agreement being executed was upon sufficient consideration. 3. Parol Agreement to Mortgage. — A parol agreement may be made to execute a mortgage in the future where the agreement is supported by a valuable consideration. The agreement itself will be treated as a mortgage in equity. See example. 4. Homestead. — The husband can encumber the homestead in the acquisition of it, and homestead rights will not obtain as long as the encumbrance lasts. The husband can renew the encumbrance or change it, at discretion, so he does not defraud his wife. 5. Same — Lien.—In the case at bar there was an agreement for lien which must be discharged before a homestead can be acquired against it. See facts. 6. Action on Promissory Note. —Either the legal or equitable owner may maintain an action upon a promissory note. See example. Appeal from Travis. Tried below before Hon. W. M. Key. Robertson & Williams, for appellants. 1. The court erred in finding that plaintiff and the defendant Martin McCarty made a parol agreement before the consummation of the purchase of the property in controversy by said McCarty from T. J. Moore and wife, by the terms of which said McCarty was to temporarily withdraw from his business the $2500 to pay Moore and wife for the property and cause Moore and wife to make a deed conveying the property to plaintiff, and that after thirty days from that time plaintiff would advance to said McCarty $2500 to replace the amount so withdrawn from his business, and that said deed was to be delivered to plaintiff, who was to hold the deed to said property and have a lien thereon until said McCarty should repay the amount, with interest, when he was to convey it to McCarty; because the great preponderance of the testimony and circumstances in this case show that no such agreement ever existed between plaintiff and defendant, and show that if any such agreement ever did exist it was changed to another and entirely different agreement before any money was advanced to defendant. Chandler v. Meckling, 22 Texas, 42; Linney v. Peloquin, 35 Texas, 36; Railway v. Bracken, 59 Texas, 75; Railway v. Schmidt, 61 Texas, 285; Zapp v. Michaelis, 58 Texas, 275; Willis v. Lewis, 28 Texas, 191; Railway v. Wallen, 65 Texas, 572; Edmundson v. Silliman, 50 Texas, 112; Taylor v. Ashley, 15 Texas, 52; Guerin v. Patterson, 55 Texas, 127; Williams v. San Saba County, 59 Texas, 442; Parker v. Coop, 60 Texas, 114. 2. The court erred in finding that the endorsement made by the plaintiff on the deed from Moore and wife held by him on August 24, 1883, was not a contract between plaintiff and McCarty, but was a voluntary statement in writing made by plaintiff for the protection of McCarty in the event of plaintiff’s death before McCarty got the $2500 as agreed upon to replace the money withdrawn from his business to pay for said property; because the endorsement was placed on the purported deed held by plaintiff long before any money was loaned to the defendant, and states distinctly and without any ambiguity or uncertainty as to intent that McCarty was entitled to a deed to the property whenever he desired it, and that in the meantime the deed could be used as a line of credit in the First National Bank for $2000; all expenses of making deed, acknowledging, etc., to be paid by McCarty. And McCarty being fully informed of this endorsement and its conditions, the deed was ever thereafter held by plaintiff for the purpose and on the terms and conditions contained in this endorsement, and its legal effect can not be contradicted and distorted more than five years after it was made on the ex parte statement of the man who wrote it and signed it.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. This suit was instituted in the District Court of Washington County, by the appellants, on the 12th of August, A? D. 1889, to recover from the possession of appellees one-third of the lands described in the petition, and for the rents and profits of same; the petitioners averring that they were and had been for some years illegally and wrongfully deprived of the use and occupation of their lands by defendants. The land sued for was the inheritable share of their deceased father, Charles Gates, of two leagues of land, granted his father, William Gates, as a colonist. The petitioners alleged, that their grandfather, William Gates, died, leaving surviving him their father, Charles Gates, and two other children as his only heirs, and that petitioners were the only heirs of their deceased father. Defendants answered by demurrers, plea of not guilty, and pleas of statutes of limitations; and plaintiffs by supplemental petition averred the coverture of each of them from 1856 to the institution of their suit. It was agreed that both plaintiffs and defendants claimed from William Gates, deceased, as a common source of title. The plaintiffs proved that they were the heirs of their deceased father, Charles Gates, and that he was one of the children and heirs of William Gates, the grantee of the lands in controversy; that the lands of his estate had never been partitioned among his heirs, and that neither their father, Charles Gates, nor themselves had received any portion of the estate of William Gates; and they proved also that they were married to their present husbands in 1856. And it was further proved by plaintiffs, that neither themselves nor their mother had ever heard of any sale by their father of his interest in his father’s estate. The defendants, in bar of plaintiffs’ right to recover, offered evidence to show that their father sold his interest in his father’s estate to his brother, Amos Gates, under whom the defendants deraign their titles. The grantee, William Gates, died in 1828, and defendants offered in evidence an agreement between counsel, by which either plaintiffs or defendants might offer in evidence any paper pertaining to the lands in controversy, without filing same or without giving notice that the paper would be offered; such paper, however, to be subject to any legal objection from the opposite party. Under this agreement the plaintiffs proposed to read in evidence what purported to be an instrument executed by plaintiffs’ father, and dated the 22d day of March, 1829, and which is in the following words: “Article of agreement: Indented, made, concluded, and fully agreed upon this 6 th day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine, between Charles Gates of one part and Amos Gates of the other: Whereas, the said Amos Gates has paid unto the said Charles Gates two hundred dollars lawful money of the Mexican nation; now, therefore, and in consideration of the said sum of two hundred dollars paid, the said Charles Gates, for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, doth by these presents covenant, promise, and agree to and with the said Amos Gates, or his assigns, to release, convey, confirm, and assure to the said Amos Gates and to his heirs forever, or to him he shall appoint or direct, all that tract and parcel of land containing one-half league on the west side of the Brazos, drawn.from government, and deeded to my father, together with all my intruse of the desests estate; and I do likewise appoint Samuel Gates, my oldest brother, to sign my name to the deed of transfer when the said Amos Gates shall think proper to have it done according to law. 1 ‘ In witness whereof, I set my hand and seal this day above riten, in the presents of the subscribed witnesses. [Signed] Charles Gates [Seal]. “ Witness: “ Eldridge Hopkins, ‘‘ Adam Lawrence.” And upon which instrument was the following certificate from the clerk of the County Court of Burleson County: “ State of Texas, County of Burleson.—Personally appeared before me, Jeremiah A. Hood, clerk of the County Court in and for the county and State aforesaid, Adam Lawrence, who, after being duly sworn, says that he saw Charles Gates sign the annexed instrument of writing for the purpose therein expressed, and that he signed the same as a witness. ‘1 Given under my hand and private seal, there being no seal of office, this 24th November, 1846. [Signed] “Jeremiah A. Hood, “Clerk C. C.B1.” . And which paper was filed, as appeared by endorsement of the clerk of the County Court of Washington County, for record in that county on the 21st of December, 1846. To the reading of this paper defendants objected upon various grounds, and among others, they urged the objection that the paper had not been filed three days before the trial, and notice given to plaintiffs’ counsel, but was offered as evidence under the agreement between counsel, and that the instrument was met by a plea of non est factum. This objection was properly overruled, we think, by the court. By their agreement with defendants’ counsel, plaintiffs had relieved defendants from the burthen of proving the instrument. It was a recorded instrument, and even if the certificate of the officer before whom it purports to have been proved be not in accordance with the statute then in force, such certificates are now good by virtue of subsequent healing acts. The paper was properly admitted over this objection. The burthen was upon the plaintiffs to show the forgery, and they could not shift that burthen to defendants by a plea of non est factum, supported by affidavit. The other objection to the introduction of this evidence urged by plaintiffs we deem it not necessary to consider, as in view of all the facts we have determined to affirm the judgment. In addition to this instrument, defendants offer in evidence a decree or judgment of the court of the alcalde of San Felipe de Austin, rendered on the 17th of February, 1834, adjudicating one-half of a league of the lands granted to William Gates to his son Amos Gates, and divesting the title of the other heirs of William Gates to said one-half league. To this decree the plaintiffs objected, because it showed upon its face that it was void; and this objection we also hold was properly overruled. The defendants proved by several witnesses, that Amos Gates was in possession of the lands for several years before the death of plaintiffs’ father; that Charles Gates lived upon the lands of his father’s estate until he left the county; that he left the lands in the year 1832; that he died in about 1840; and that his widow and children returned to the county between his death and 1846, and lived upon the lands granted to his father, and in a house thereon owned by Amos Gates, and near to his residence, and were supported by him until they left the county between the years 1850 and 1853. The evidence also showed that Amos Gates purchased the interest of his brother, Samuel Gates, in his father’s estate, and also the interest of his two sisters, Mrs. Kuykendall and Mrs. Cooper; that he was the administrator of his father’s estate, and that he was duly discharged from his trust by an order of court in May, 1830; that he claimed and exercised rights of ownership over both the leagues of land granted to his father until he sold and conveyed the lower league in 1857. There was also evidence that Charles Gates was heard to say repeatedly that he had sold all of his interest in his father’s estate to his brother Amos. The plaintiffs put in evidence a power of attorney from Charles Gates to Samuel May Williams, dated in Nacogdoches, November, 1833, authorizing and empowering Williams to convey title to his entire interest in his father’s estate to his brother Amos Gates. There was no evidence of any assertion or claim of title to the lands in controversy by plaintiffs until the institution of this suit. These facts, considered in connection with the further fact that in the lifetime of Charles Gates a paroi sale of land was valid, the court holds to be sufficient to establish a sale by Charles Gates of his interest in his father’s estate to his brother, Amos Gates, and that the judgment of the court should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed. Delivered February 9, 1893. Judge Garrett did not sit in this case.","Isabella J. Davidson et al. v. M. M. Felder et al. No. 40. 1. Agreement of Counsel.—Counsel having agreed that either party might offer any paper in evidence pertaining to the land in controversy, without filing same, and without giving notice that the paper would be offered, such paper to be subject to any legal objections from the opposite party; and plaintiffs claiming the land as heirs of Charles Gates, defendants were properly allowed to read, without filing or notice, an article of agreement, proven for record by one of the subscribing witnesses, and signed by Charles Gates, by which he agreed to convey to his brother Amos (under whom defendants claim) the land in controversy. 2. Affidavit of Forgery—Burden of Proof.—A paper offered in evidence under above agreement being met by a plea of non est factum, was nevertheless admissible; the burden of proof was upon the party asserting the forgery to prove it, and it was not shifted to the opposite party by the plea. 3. Case in Judgment—Evidence Showing Good Title.—Plaintiffs claimed as heirs of their father, Charles Gates, his undivided interest in lands granted to his father, William, and proved their heirship and coverture. Defendants deraigned their title under Amos Gates, a brother of Charles. They showed an article of agreement signed by Charles, and proven by a subscribing witness, by which he agreed to convey to Amos his interest in the estate of his father and the land in controversy, in consideration of $200 received. They also showed a decree of the alcalde of San Felipe de Austin, of February 17,1834, divesting the title of the other heirs of William Gates, and vesting it in Amos. They proved that Amos was in possession of the land several years before the death of his father; that Charles lived on the land until he left the county in 1832; that he died in 1840, and his widow and children returned in 1840 and lived on the land in a house belonging to Amos until 1850 or 1853. when they left; that Amos bought the interests of his other brothers and sisters, and claimed and exercised acts of ownership over the land until he sold, in 1857; and that Charles had been heard repeatedly to say that he had sold his interest in his father’s estate to Amos. Under these facts, and as during the lifetime of Charles a paroi sale of land was valid, the judgment in favor of defendants is affirmed. Appeal from Washington. Tried below before Hon. C. C. Garrett. Graft & Croft and Searcey & Garrett, for appellants. 1. An instrument of writing so vague and indefinite on its face as not to show what is meant by it, whether it be a deed or power of attorney, and which fails to describe the land pretended to be conveyed by it, and which fails to-show whose estate is meant to be conveyed by it, and which requires evidence aliunde to identify the land and its location, is absolutely void. Norris v. Hunt, 51 Texas, 610; Wright v. Lancaster, 48 Texas, 250; Jones v. Carver, 59 Texas, 294. 2. The court erred in construing said instrument of writing to be a deed: (1) Because it showed upon its face that it was an agreement to have Samuel Gates make the deed to Amos Gates according to law, and authorized Samuel Gates to sign his (Charles’) name to the deed. (2) Because it was an agreement to put the contract of sale in writing, and to do it according to law, and the law of Texas at that time required a contract for the sale of land to be made before a notary public, or some one with the functions of a notary. (3) Because the agreement contained a condition precedent, which by its veiy terms had to be performed before Charles Gates’ title passed. (4) Because the power of attorney made by Charles Gates in 1833, appointing Samuel M. Williamson, of the town of Austin, his attorney in fact, to represent his interest in and to his father’s estate, and to transfer it to Amos Gates, shows that they did not consider said first instrument, dated March 6, 1829, a deed, and that they both, Amos and Charles Gates, recognized that Charles Gates still had at that date, 1833, an interest in and to his deceased father’s estate.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. September 7, 1886, appellee J. B. Shearer filed this suit in the District Court of Tarrant County against the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company. Afterward, on December 6, 1886, Ricker, Lee & Co., a firm of contractors composed of N. H. Ricker, F. L. Lee, and Joe A. Owens, were, by amended petition, made parties defendant. The suit is for the recovery of damages for the loss of an arm and other serious personal injuries charged to have been sustained by plaintiff while in the service of defendants as a brakeman. The injuries are alleged to have occurred April 7, 1886, while defendants were engaged in constructing and operating a line of railway at or near Coleman Junction, in this State, and are ascribed to the negligence of the defendants in permitting the brake beams of one of the cars to be broken, and in permitting the roadbed of defendant’s track to become uneven and remain unballasted. The defendant company filed a general denial, and pleaded specially, that the work upon which plaintiff was injured was being done by Ricker, Lee & Co. under an independent contract; that plaintiff was in the employ of Ricker, Lee & Co., and that the railway company had nothing to do with his injury. It filed a cross-bill against Ricker, Lee & Co., alleging that if plaintiff suffered from the negligence of any one, such negligence was chargeable to Ricker, Lee & Co.; and it prayed, if the same should be imputed by operation of law to the defendant company, for judgment against Ricker, Lee & Co. The defendants, Ricker, Lee & Co., pleaded their privilege to be sued in Galveston County, where they resided. To this plea the court sustained exceptions. They also relied upon the general issue, and especially denied their liability to the railway company, alleging that at the time of the injury complained of by plaintiff, the latter was in the exclusive service of the defendant company. A trial, in November, 1887, resulted in a verdict in the sum of $7500 in favor of the plaintiff against the railway company. Ricker, Lee & Co. were discharged. From the judgment, in accordance with this verdict, the railway company prosecutes this appeal. On the trial the railway company read in evidence a contract in writing between itself and Ricker, Lee & Co. This instrument set forth the terms on which Ricker, Lee & Co., as contractors, agreed to perform “ all the grading, bridging, tieing, track laying, and stone culvert construction on the Lampasas extension of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway in the State of Texas, extending from station 3873 to station 5280.” It was shown that the line as far as the last named station had been completed, and that on reaching that point it was desired to extend the road to Ballinger. It was consequently agreed verbally, that the line would be extended by the contractors to Ballinger on the terms and specifications embodied in the written contract, simply substituting places, stations, and lines. The plaintiff was injured while the work was being done on the latter extension. The railway company took the deposition of one F. W. Steber. It offered to read in evidence an interrogatory, and the answer thereto, as follows: Interrogatory: “.If you have stated before that you were an engineer upon the road, state whether or not you had any control or management over Ricker, Lee & Co. State what your duties were, and what theirs were. State whether or not you controlled or directed the work to be done, or the manner in which they should do it, and the place at which they should work, or was that left to them or to their discretion, under the contract with the company ?’ ’ Answer: “Ricker, Lee & Co. were to build, construct, and complete the road so that it would be accepted by the engineer in chief on its completion. I controlled and directed the work to be done only indirectly and as the manager of the business of my superior. The detail of the work was left to the contractors. The results of the work were what the railway company was after.” The plaintiff objected to this answer, because it undertook to interpret and construe the written contract read in evidence between Ricker, Lee & Co. and the railway company, and to state the substance thereof. Appellant complains of the action of the court in sustaining this objection. We think that the court was correct. The contract stated the relative duties of the contractors and of the engineer, and the relation of the latter to the former. The interpretation of the witness was but a statement of his opinion or conclusion as to the legal effect of the written contract. This opinion was inadmissible. Purnell v. Gandy, 46 Texas, 191. The defendant company offered to read in evidence the following cross-interrogatory propounded by plaintiff, and the answer thereto: Interrogatory: “Is it not a fact that the engineer or conductor in' charge of said train by which plaintiff was injured was carried on the pay rolls of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company and was paid by said company ?” Answer: “ I did not so understand it. He was acting both as engineer and conductor, and my understanding was that he was paid by Ricker, Lee & Co. He was entirely under their direction, and we had nothing at all to do with him. That is, neither myself nor Lynch, nor any one else acting with the railway company, had anything to do with the engineer.” Objections were made to this answer, because it was not responsive, and because it stated the understanding of the witness as to the legal effect of the contract. That portion of the answer in which the witness refers to his understanding was inadmissible, for reasons already pointed out. The remainder is not responsive and suggests an attempted evasion. An objection on this ground, however, can not be urged for the first time on the trial. It refers to the manner and form of taking the deposition, and advantage can be taken of it only by motion to suppress and notice under the statute. Railway v. Ivy, 71 Texas, 409; Parker v. Chancellor, 78 Texas, 524. The court, therefore, erred in excluding so much of the answer as does not refer to the understanding of the witness. This error, however, does not justify a reversal of the judgment. The witness had testified to the same effect in his direct examination, and the answer was merely cumulative of testimony elsewhere introduced by the railway company through its witness Webster Snyder, that “ the engineer, fireman, and such other employes as may have been connected with the train, were not in the employ or the hire nor under the control of the railway company.” Appellant’s third assignment of error is as follows: ‘ ■ The court erred in its general charge to the jury, because the same fails to define with particularity the several issues presented in this case as between the plaintiff and the several defendants, and as between the defendants, whereby the jury were misled in the application of the evidence.” The following is the court’s entire charge, the insertion of which we find necessary in discussing this assignment and subsequent ones: “ 1. The jury are instructed that it is the duty of those operating a railroad towards those in their employ to exercise reasonable care in keeping the cars used by their employes in safe condition; and if they fail to use such care, and an injury thereby results to the employe while in the discharge of his employment, not caused by his own negligence, the cmployer would be liable for such injury. ‘ ‘ 2. You are further instructed that when a person enters the service of. those operating a railroad, he thereby assumes all the ordinary risks incident to the employment undertaken, and is required to exercise that degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence, acting under like circumstances, would use to avoid injury, and the care required is proportioned to the known condition of the road and cars operated. “3. If you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff at the time of the alleged injuries was in the employment of the defendant the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company, and that he was by the direction of the agents of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company engaged in work in which he was injured, and that the injury resulted from or was caused by the defective brake beam of a car which he was attempting to couple, and that the plaintiff was himself at the time acting in a prudent, careful manner, then you should find for the plaintiff as against the defendant the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company; and if you find that he was so injured without his fault, by reason of a defective brake beam of a car, and that at the time the said cars were being operated by both defendants, then you should find for him against all the defendants; but unless you believe from the evidence that at the time of the alleged injury the plaintiff was in the employ of said Ricker, Lee & Co., lie would not be entitled to recover of said Ricker, Lee & Co. “4. If, however, you believe'from the evidence that the injury to the plaintiff resulted from a want of that care which a person of ordinary prudence would have used under like circumstances, and with the plaintiff’s knowledge of the condition of said cars, or if such negligence on his part contributed to the injury, then you should find for the defendants, notwithstanding you may believe that the track and car, or either, were in an unsafe condition. “5. If you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was injured by reason of a defective car, without his fault, and if you further believe that at the time of the alleged injury the said car was being operated by the defendants Ricker, Lee & Co. in construction of an extension of the road, and not by the defendant company, and that at the time of the alleged injury the plaintiff was in the employ of said Ricker, Lee & Co., then you should find for the plaintiff against said Ricker, Lee & Co., and for the defendant company. “6. If under the foregoing instructions you should find for the plaintiff against the defendant company, and if you further believe from the evidence that the said Ricker, Lee & Co., by contract with the defendant company, undertook to build the road from Coleman Junction to Ballinger, and if you further believe from the evidence that as between said Ricker, Lee & Co. and the defendant company it was agreed that said Ricker, Lee & Co. were to employ the brakemen necessary to operate trains or cars used in constructing the road, and that the plaintiff was injured while a train was being made up under the direction of Ricker, Lee & Co., for their own use, and that the injury resulted from a defective brake beam on one of the cars so used, and if you further believe that by the terms of such verbal contract the said Ricker, Lee & Co. were to keep the cars used by them in repair, then you should find for the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company against said Ricker, Lee & Co. for the amount so awarded against the company. “7. If you believe from the evidence that by a verbal contract between the defendant company and said Ricker, Lee & Co. it was agreed that the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company were to furnish said Ricker, Lee & Co. with engines, cars, and train men necessary in the construction of said road, and that said railway company had and exercised the right to employ and discharge those operating the construction trains, and to change engines and cars used by said Ricker, Lee & Co., then said Ricker, Lee & Co. would not be responsible to said company for any injury resulting from a defect of said cars or machinery, in the event a verdict should be rendered against said company. “8. If under the foregoing instructions you should find for the plaintiff against the defendants, or either of them, you will assess his damages at such an amount as you believe would fairly, reasonably, and justly compensate him for the injury sustained, considering the mental and physical suffering caused by such injury and his diminished ability to earn money resulting therefrom. “You are the exclusive judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the testimony.” This charge, under fair construction, does not impress us as being subject to the criticism of appellant. In the first, second, and fourth paragraphs, the jury are pertinently instructed as to what constitutes negli ■ gence on the part of a railroad company, on the degree of care resting on the employe, and on the effect of contributory negligence. Granting that the plaintiff was the victim of negligence in some manner, the remaining issues arise out of the inquiry, Who was guilty of the negligence ? This, in turn, begets the question, In whose employ was the plaintiff ? The latter charges that he was in the employ of both defendants. Ricker, Lee & Co. deny that he was in their service, and assert that he was in the exclusive employment of the railway company, by virtue of a verbal agreement by which the latter retained exclusive control over the cars and trainmen. Hence, paragraphs three and seven of the charge. The railway company denied that the plaintiff was in their service, alleging that he was in the employ of Ricker, Lee & Co. Hence, paragraph five. Again, the defendant company charges, that if, as between it and the plaintiff, it was chargeable with negligence, nevertheless Ricker, Lee & Co. were responsible to it per force of the verbal agreement to keep in repair cars used by them, including the car on which plaintiff was injured. Hence, paragraph six of the charge. It thus appears that the court adapted its instructions to every issue in the case. If there was any defect, it was one of omission purely, which the plaintiff should have sought to supply by request for special instructions. Railway v. Helm, 64 Texas, 147. These remarks are also applicable to appellant’s fourth assignment of error, in which it complains of the failure of the court to interpret the contract between the defendant railway company and Ricker, Lee & Co. for the construction of the railway, and to instruct the jury as to the legal effect of the contract upon the rights of the several parties. Having failed to ask for such interpretation by means of a special charge, no heed will be given to such complaint urged for the first time in this court. Endick v. Endick, 61 Texas, 559; Ins. Co. v. Ende, 65 Texas, 118. Appellant, in its tenth, eleventh, and twelfth assignments of error, complains of the court’s refusal to give its second, third, and fourth special instructions, as follows: “ 2. If you should believe from the evidence that the engineer Russ and the fireman Lambka had been in the employ of the railway company, and were sent by them to run the train for Ricker, Lee & Co., and while carried on the pay roll of the company were paid by it, but that the same was charged to Ricker, Lee & Co. by agreement and paid by them, then you are instructed that the legal effect of the same would be to make said Russ and Lambka employes of Ricker, Lee & Co., and not of this defendant. “ 3. The mere fact, if it be a fact', that the plaintiff and his coemployes, Russ and Lambka, had been regular employes of the railway company, and were sent to Coleman Junction by it to act as brakeman, engineer, and fireman, respectively, on the train controlled and operated by Ricker, Lee & Co. m the construction of the road under their contract, would not make them employes of the railway company if they were actually paid by Ricker, Lee & Co. m person or through the agency of the railway company, and the railway company would not owe the plaintiff any obligation as an employe. “4. If you believe from the evidence that the railway company made a contract with Ricker, Lee & Co. to build the road from Coleman Junction to Ballinger, and agreed to lease them an engine and cars for the purpose of using the same in the construction of said railway, and further agreed to deliver them material at Coleman Junction, and that the railway company did deliver to them the car which ran over the plaintiff, and that the railway company sent them the engineer, fireman, and brakeman, and kept the engineer and fireman on its pay roll, and that while said engineer and fireman were coupling up a train on the spur track to carry out materials for the said Ricker, Lee & Co., and under their instructions, the said plaintiff was hurt through a defective brake beam upon a car which he was trying to couple to another, and you should further believe that said engineer and fireman who ran said train were being paid by Ricker, Lee & Co., through the agency of the railway company, for the convenience of said Ricker, Lee & Co., and were then doing their work, then you will find a verdict for the railway company, no matter what verdict you may return as to the other defendants, Ricker, Lee & Co.” These charges were properly rejected. The second instruction is founded upon evidence in the record that Russ and Lambka, the engineer and fireman operating the train in connection with which the plaintiff was injured, were carried upon the pay rolls of the railway company for the convenience of the contractors, and would be paid their regular wages by the company, the amount being repaid at the end of each month by Ricker, Lee & Co. This was not the only evidence, however, bearing upon the relation of these employes. The testimony introduced by Ricker, Lee & Co. was to the effect that the train men, including the plaintiff, the engineer, and the fireman, were selected by the company, and subject alone to be discharged by it. This testimony is ignored in the charge asked. It might, therefore, have been construed by the jury as indicating an opinion by the court that the fact in the special charge referred to should alone determine ,the relation of the parties mentioned. It is not proper for the court to cull from the body of conflicting evidence special features that may be favorable to the one litigant or the other, emphasizing their weight in its instructions. The second and third special instructions are subject to a similar criticism. The former seems to make the payment of wages the sole test of responsibility; the latter the existence of the contract between appellant and Ricker, Lee & Co.; both ignoring other material evidence bearing upon the controlling question, In whose service was the plaintiff at the time ? The real test for the answer to which is, To whose orders and control was the plaintiff subject, and by whom was he liable to be discharged ? Wood on Mast, and Serv., sec. 317. Appellant in its fifth assignment complains of the third paragraph of the court’s charge, already set out. It is insisted that the concluding clause of the charge is misleading, to the prejudice of appellant, because it limits the right of plaintiff to recover against Ricker, Lee & Co. to his being in their employ. The plaintiff’s petition shows that his cause of action against Ricker, Lee & Co. is founded upon the fact of such employment. He charges that he was in the employment of both parties; that he was their servant, and that as his masters they were guilt)' of negligence towards him. Unless, therefore, he was in the employment of Ricker, Lee & Co., he was not entitled to a verdict against them. The charge conforms to the case made by the pleadings, and is correct. Appellant assigns as error the refusal of the court to give its eighth special instruction, as follows: “ The plaintiff alleges in this case that he received his injuries from a defect in a brake beam and its connections, etc., and through defect in the track by reason of it being unsurfaced; and if the evidence should prove to you that the brake beam was out of order and that the track was not surfaced, and that the injury to plaintiff was the result of these two causes combined, and not to the defective brake beam alone, and you should also believe from the evidence that this unsurfaced condition of the track was familiar to the plaintiff, and had been known to him before he undertook to make the coupling at the time of the injury to him, then 3'ou will find for the defendants.” We do not think that this instruction embodies the law. When there are concurrent causes of an injury, each of which contributes thereto, the fact that one of the causes might have been avoided by the plaintiff, or that with reference to it he might have been guilty of. contributory negligence, will not exempt the company as to the other cause. Railway v. Somers, 78 Texas, 439. Such we take to be a corollary from the doctrine announced in Railway v. Cummings, 106 U. S., 266. It is there held that “ if the negligence of the company contributed to — that is to sa3r, had a share in — producing the injury, the company is liable, even though the negligence of the fellow servant is contributory also.” Besides, the charge was to the effect that knowledge on the part of the plaintiff of the unballasted condition of the track would suffice to render him guilty of contributory negligence. This, in our opinion, is not the law. Wood Mast, and Serv., secs. 357-359. The question of contrib-' utory negligence on the part of one occupying the position of plaintiff was for the jury. Id., sec. 159. In its sixteenth assignment of error appellant complains of the court’s refusal to give its sixth special instruction, as follows: “ If you should believe from the evrdence that Ricker, Lee & Co. were controlling the cars and the train, in the coupling of which plaintiff was hurt, and you should believe from the evidence that there was a defective brake beam upon one of the cars which caused the injury to the plaintiff; and you should also believe that said cars were placed upon the side or spur track by the railway company, loaded with materials for the use of Ricker, Lee & Co., and that said car was being moved out by Ricker, Lee & Co., or was being prepared to be moved out in the train controlled by Ricker, Lee & Co., and that by contract said Ricker, Lee <& Co. were to repair all cars in their use, then you are instructed that the railway company owed no duty to the plaintiff to furnish Ricker, Lee & Co. with a perfect car, and incurred no liability to him by reason of any defect in such car, and you will find a verdict for the said railway company against the plaintiff.” The evidence relied upon b3r the plaintiff, as well as that introduced by Ricker, Lee & Co., was to the effect that the relation of master and servant existed between appellee and the railway company. If such was the case, the duty of the company to the appellee could not be affected by the contract between it and Ricker, Lee & Co., to which the appellee was not a party. The charge requested was wholly ignored by the evidence referred to, and was correctly refused. Appellant insists that the court should have set aside the verdict of the j ury because it was contrary to the fifth and sixth paragraphs of the court’s charge already set out. The statement of facts is quite voluminous, and we do not feel called upon to critically dissect it. Suffice it to say, that it was conflicting on the issues embodied in the paragraphs referred to. The finding of the jury on each issue involved in its verdict is supported by sufficient testimony, and we do not feel authorized to disturb it. Delivered November 15, 1892. Appellant’s eighteenth and final assignment of error complains that the court erred in overruling its amended motion for a new trial. This motion is supported by affidavits of divers persons (with one exception employes of the defendant company), setting up facts within their knowledge in conflict with the testimony of the plaintiff and of Owens, a member of the firm of Ricker, Lee & Co. The motion is founded upon the statement by appellant’s counsel that they were surprised by the testimony of these witnesses. We do not think that the application shows ground for surprise. The testimony of these witnesses is addressed to issues clearly indicated by their pleading, the purpose of which was to enable the defendant to be prepared with testimony to disprove its allegations. It is not claimed that the testimony.referred to in the affidavits was newly discovered, that it was unknown to appellant at the time of the trial, or that the witnesses could not have been had at the trial. No effort was made by appellant to withdraw its announcement, but it proceeded, taking its chances for a verdict on the evidence already introduced by it. There was no abuse of judicial discretion in overruling the motion. Kilgore v. Jordan, 17 Texas, 346; Dotson v. Moss, 58 Texas, 156. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Motion for rehearing refused.","The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. J. B. Shearer et al. No. 409. 1. Evidence — Opinion of Witness. — The opinion or conclusion of a witness as to the legal effect of a written contract given in evidence, is not admissible. See example. 2. Practice — Deposition — Answer.not Responsive.— That the answer of a witness by deposition is not responsive to the question, is an objection that can be taken only by motion to suppress and notice under the statute. 3. Practice — Cumulative Evidence. — The erroneous exclusion of evidence which is merely cumulative is not ground for reversal. 4. Railway Company’s Liability for Defective Track and Cars. See opinion for charge of court held to correctly define the respective liabilities of a railway company and a construction company employed to build its road, for damages to an employe resulting from defective track and cars. 5. Charge of Court — Special Instructions. — Where the charge covers the issues of the case, and its defect, if any, is an omission to particularize more fully, special instructions should be requested at the trial, in order that objection on this account may avail on appeal. 6. Same — Requested Instruction. — It is proper for the court to refuse requested instructions which cull from the body of conflicting evidence special features that may be favorable to the one litigant or the other, and the weight of which would be emphasized by such instructions. 7. Contributory Negligence — Concurrent Causes of Injury.— When there are concurrent causes of an injury, each of which contributes thereto, the fact that one of the causes might have been avoided by the plaintiff, or that with reference to it he might have been guilty of contributory negligence, will not exempt the company as to the other cause. 8. Same — Defective Roadbed. — Where a railway employe is injured, and his injury results in part from the unballasted condition of the track, his knowledge of such condition does not render him guilty of contributory negligence. 9. Railway Company — Liability to Employe not Affected, when. Where a brakeman is in the employ of a railway company, its liability to him is not affected by a contract, to which he is not a party, between such company and a firm employed by the railway company to construct its road. 10. New Trial — Surprise. — Defendant’s surprise at the testimony of plaintiff’s witnesses is notground for granting anewtrial, when such testimony is adduced to issues clearly indicated by plaintiff’s pleading, the purpose of which was to enable defendant to be prepared with testimony to disprove its allegations.

The third special charge requested by appellant [see opinion] was correctly refused, because it was upon the weight of the evidence, and made the mere payment of wages alone the determining fact as to whether appellant employed plaintiff or not, and as to whether appellant was guilty of negligence, Heldt v. Webster, 60 Texas, 207; Wood on Mast. and Serv., sec. 317. 7. The eighth special charge requested by appellant did not embody the law applicable to the facts therein stated, for if the injury was the result of the combined causes, as stated in said special charge, appellant would have been liable, if the other facts should concur. Railway v. Cummings, 106 U. S., 700; Cool. on Torts, 560. 8. Said special charge was erroneous and should not have been given, because it, in effect, held that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence by reason of the simple fact that the plaintiff was familiar with the condition of the unsurfaced track, which is not the law. Snow v. Railway, 8 Allen, 411; Wood on Mast. and Serv., secs. 357-359; Reed v. Northfleld, 13 Pick., 98; Patterson v. Railway, 76 Pa. St., 389; Fletcher v. Railway, 1 Allen, 9; Greenleaf v.

Appellant could fairly have anticipated the testimony of said witnesses Shearer and Owens, because they were parties to the suit, and their pleadings clearly indicated that such testimony would be given; and appellant should have made its surprise thereat known at the trial, and asked for time to meet the testimony; failing to do which, it was not entitled to a new trial.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This appeal is prosecuted by J. F. Smith, J. D. Reed, and E. G-. Thurmond, from a verdict and judgment rendered in the District Court of Cooke County, on the 22nd day of November, 1889, in favor of F. M. Dougherty, in the sum of $3257.72, reviving to that extent and for the use and benefit of said Dougherty two certain judgments against appellants, the one in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank and the other in favor of J. W. Wilson, which judgments so revived were rendered in the District Court of Cooke County in the year 1885, in the aggregate sum of about $16,000. In the year 1885 the Boatman Savings Bank recovered a judgment in the District Court of Cooke County against J. W. Dabbs & Co., and Fore, Morphy & Henderson, as principals, and the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, R. S. Rollins, and others, as endorsers, in the sum of twenty thousand and some hundred dollars. Fore, Morphy & Henderson delivered to said Rollins, in order to protect said cattle company and Rollins and others as endorsers, two certain notes, executed by appellants, upon which the judgments sought to be revived by this suit were rendered. These notes were to be collected and the proceeds applied to the payment of said original judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank, and were after-wards placed in judgments by the attorneys for said Boatman Savings Bank, under the direction of said Rollins; the one in the name of said bank, and the other, for convenience, in the name of J. W. Wilson, who was president of said cattle company. After these judgments were all obtained, in the latter part of the year 1885 said cattle company became insolvent. On the 2nd day of March, 1886, said cattle company; through J. W. Wilson, its president, assigned the two judgments sought to be revived in this suit to F. M. Dougherty, who was president of the First National Bank of Gainesville. It is alleged in the pleadings both of appellants and appellees that at that date said judgments were owned by said cattle company, though subject to the rights of said Boatman Savings Bank. Under said original judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank, in the months of February, March, and June, 1886, certain lands of said cattle company were sold at execution sale and the proceeds applied as credits upon said original judgment. The sales in February and March reduced the amount due on the same to about $8000, and the June sale to about $6000. The collateral judgments were allowed to become dormant. When the cattle company became insolvent it was indebted to the First National Bank of Gainesville, by note, in the sum of about $18,000, which was secured by mortgage on cattle to the extent of about $16,000. In the month of January or February, 1886, appellant Smith undertook to procure at a discount debts against the insolvent cattle company in amount sufficient to offset the two collateral judgments, and engaged one Hulen, a director in the cattle company, to assist him, or to procure them for him, agreeing to pay him one-half of what Smith might save in offsetting said judgments. He succeeded in obtaining for Smith four notes against the cattle company; one in February, 1886, called the McAdams note, for about $10,000, less a credit of some $3000; the other three in May, 1886, called the McCubbins and Rolls notes, for less amounts, the purchase being made on the 20th and the purchase price paid on the 28th of May. The McAdams note and the balance due on the original Boatman Savings Bank judgment were allowed in the court below as offsets, and the other notes were rejected. Hulen procured one Sacra, vice president of said cattle company, to assist him in obtaining said notes for Smith, which he did to the extent of giving information as to where and how to find them — Hulen agreeing to pay him one-half the profit or compensation coining to him under the arrangement with Smith. In September, 1886, at the request of Hulen, Smith paid one-half of the sum promised Hulen- to Sacra; and the proof tended to show that prior to this time Smith had no knowledge of the employment of Sacra by Hulen. The proof failed to show that either Smith or Hulen had actual knowledge of the transfer of the judgments to Dougherty until after the offsets had been acquired, though Sacra did have such knowledge at the time of the transfer. The record discloses that some, if not all, of the notes pleaded as offsets were placed in the hands of W. O. Davis, Esq., by Smith and Hulen, in February, 1886, and that the McCubbins and Rolls notes were on the 20th day of May, as well as prior thereto, in some wajr pledged as collateral security to R. S. Rollins, vice president of said First National Bank of Gainesville, and J. M. Lindsay, an officer of Gainesville National Bank, to secure to said two banks debts due to them severally. A judgment was obtained in the District Court of Cooke County against said cattle company in favor of R. S. Rollins on the 22nd day of December, 188». for about $30,000, based upon two certain notes payable to Wilson & Ilearne, signed by J. W. Wilson as president of said cattle company, and John H. Stone, secretary, endorsed by I-Iearne to J. W. Wilson and by Wilson to Rollins; and said judgment was on said 2nd day of March, 1886, assigned by Rollins to Dougherty. On the same day said F. M. Dougherty, through J. H. Garnett, Esq., law partner of W. 0. Davis, caused a writ of garnishment to issue against appellants, and contemporaneously therewith said Wilson, at the suggestion of said Garnett, made the assignment of said other judgment as above stated. There is much diversity disclosed in the record among the witnesses with reference to the ownership, history, use, and purpose of this $30,000 judgment. The record discloses that J. W. Wilson was indebted to Dougherty individually in the sum of about $10,000. On the 20th of May, 1886, when the rejected offsets were purchased by Smith, there were present in the office of Davis & Garnett, Messrs. Garnett, Smith, Hulen, and Rollins, there being a conflict in the evidence as to whether or not Sacra was there. At this meeting Smith paid balance due on, and obtained assignment of, the original judgment in favor of the Boatman Savings Bank. Nothing was said about the assignment of the collateral judgments against appellants at this meeting, and Smith seems to have been ignorant of that fact, and perhaps also Hulen, though the fact was known to Rollins, who was vice president of said First National Bank, and who was released by Smith as endorser on said original judgment, in which matter lie appears to have been acting for himself; but in the matter of the sale of said notes to be used as offsets he seems to have acted in behalf of said First National Bank, of which he was an officer, though not actively engaged in its service, the money realized from the sale of said notes to Smith being in part paid to said bank by him. He states that Smith, or Hulen in Smith’s presence, then and there agreed to pay the balance due on said First National Bank debt after the cattle mortgaged to it should be applied thereto, there being an estimated balance of $1800 or $2000, and that he would not have acted as he did in selling said offsets but for this promise on Smith’s or Hulen’s part. Smith and Hulen state that the promise was conditioned upon the Wichita sale reducing the amount due Smith on the original judgment to such an extent as to leave a balance of $1800 or $2000 due on the collateral judgments, after applying all offsets. It is also disclosed that the first notice that Garnett had of the notes being left with his partner was on the 2nd day of March, 1886, just after he drew up the garnishment papers, and that he did not inform Davis of the existence of the assignment of the judgments, and that this fact was not present to his mind until recalled, long after this transaction. The evidence as to the purpose of the assignment of the judgments sought to be revived tends to different conclusions. The theory of appellees, which lias support in the record, is that these judgments were assigned for the purpose of securing the $18,000 debt due the First National Bank. There is some evidence tending to show that they ma)r have been assigned to secure the $30,000 Rollins judgment, or, in part, the debt of J. W. Wilson. On the 8th of April, 1888, appellee Dougherty, through his attorneys, filed an application for scire facias to revive the two judgments herein. After the two writs were served on appellants the causes were on their motion, at the April term, 1889, consolidated; at which term of the court there was a trial of this cause without any exceptions having been taken to the form of said application or scire facias. A new trial being granted at the November term of said year, appellants, for the first time, filed exceptions to the form of said application and scire facias, which were overruled and exceptions reserved. The first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error complain of the action of the court in overruling appellants’ special exceptions to the scire facias and application therefor upon which this suit is founded. These exceptions relate to the form of the pleadings complained of, and we are of opinion that the court did not err in overruling them; they came too late after there had been a trial and continuance of the cause at the former term without any objection having been made to said scire facias and application. The fifth assignment complains of the action of the court in permitting certain allegations of fraud and conspiracy in the supplemental pleadings of appellee to be read to the jury after the exceptions of appellants had been sustained thereto. We think this practice is not to be commended; but, under the circumstances disclosed' in the record, no reversible error was committed. The sixth and seventh assignments complain of the admission in evidence of the assignment of the two judgments sought to be revived in this suit, because it was not alleged and shown that J. W. Wilson had any interest in or authority to transfer the judgment in the name of the Boatman Savings Bank, or that the Boatman Savings Bank was not the owner thereof, because the transfer of the other judgment to Dougherty was made subject to the rights of the Boatman Savings Bank and it was not shown that it had parted with its interest in said judgment. These judgments and the assignments thereof were sufficiently identified by the scire facias to admit them in evidence, and we are of opinion that the objections raised related rather to their effect than to their admissibility, and tha-t the court did not err in this respect. The tenth assignment complains of the exclusion from the jury of certain testimony which witness W. O. Davis proposed to give in response to a question propounded to him by appellants. After he had testified that J. P. Smith called at his office and left with him the notes relied upon as offsets in this case, or at least some of them, he ivas asked by appellants’ counsel to state for Avhat purpose J. P. Smith left the notes with him; and having answered that he did not know except from what J. P. Smith said at the time of leaving the notes, the appellants’ counsel then asked him to state what Smith said when he left the notes as to his object or purpose in leaving them, expecting to prove that Smith said he left said notes for safe keeping only and to be held by Davis until Smith should call for them. This testimony was objected to by appellee, because, first, Smith could not make evidence for himself; second, the witness had no right to detail a conversation with his client, and because said conversation was hearsay. » As this transaction occurred prior to the date of the transfer to the appellee of the judgment sought to be revived, we are unable to see how the statement by Smith could be deemed in any sense a self-serving declaration. The second objection, that he could not detail a conversation Avitli his client, is equally untenable, because a confidential communication is the privilege of the client, and not of his antagonist in litigation. It is equally clear that the testimony was not hearsay, but a verbal act coming clearly within the meaning of the rule on that subject. It was contemporaneous with the main fact under consideration and was so connected with it as to illustrate its character. See Greenl. Ev., sec. 108. Appellee in his brief seeks to sustain this ruling on the ground that Smith and Hulen had both been on the stand and testified. We fail to find in their evidence any statement of Smith’s purpose in lodging these notes with Davis. If they had testified at the trial that the purpose was to leave them for safe keeping, it seems to us that it would have been admissible to eorrobarate their evidence by the declaration made at the very time the notes were deposited. After a careful consideration of the complex issues disclosed in this record, Ave are unable to say that this error on the part of the court was not prejudicial to the rights of appellants. It became a material inquiry whether the knowledge on the part of Garnett of the transfer of the judgments in controversy should be imputed to Smith, on account of the alleged relationship of attorney and client between Davis and Garnett on the one hand and Smith on the other. Two theories were raised by the evidence and submitted by the court in his charge to the jury; the one that the relationship of attorney and client had been so established when the notes pleaded as offsets were placed in the hands of Davis; and the other, that they were not placed there to create or in virtue of said relationship, but for safe keeping only. The fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, twenty-third, and thirty-second assignments of error complain of charges given and refused upon the theory that this relation of attorney and client would, under the circumstances disclosed in the record, make Smith chargeable with the knowledge of Garnett. We are of opinion that if this relation was created, and the scope of employment contemplated that they would act for Smith in asserting offsets against said judgments assigned to Dougherty, notice at the proper time to either Davis or Garnett would be binding upon Smith, and hence we think that these assignments are not well taken. The twentieth and twenty-first assignments complain of the refusal of the court to give the second and third requested instructions. We are not prepared to say that it was error to refuse said second instruction, but are of opinion that the third instruction was applicable to one theory of the case, and should have been given. It is as follows:' “ Third. If you believe from the evidence that the said judgment in favor of Rollins was in fact owned by J.W. Wilson, on the 2nd of March, 1886, and that said Wilson, acting for said Stone Cattle and Pasture Company, transferred the two judgments sought to be revived to secure said judgment in the name of R. S. Rollins, you will find for the defendants, unless you believe from the evidence that said company, with knowledge of all the facts, has since ratified said transfer.” The latter part of this requested instruction on the subject of ratification seems to us to add nothing to its force or value, and need not have been given. There was a conflict of evidence as to the ownership of the $30,000 judgment, obtained in the name of Rollins, and there was also some evidence tending to show that the judgments sought to be revived may have been assigned to secure the Rollins judgment; we think appellants were entitled to have their theory of the evidence submitted to the jury to disprove the case alleged by appellees. By the eighteenth assignment complaint is made of the following charge, as quoted in appellants’ brief: “ If R. S. Rollins was vice president and director of the First National Bank, and knew of the transfer to Dougherty from Wilson, and knew that Smith did not know of such transfer; and if said Rollins was present when J. P. Smith purchased or paid for the notes claimed as offsets herein, and, was engaged at said time in his character as officer and director in transacting the business of the said bank, and did not disclose to Smith his knowledge, if any, of said transfer, then said offsets would be valid credits against the judgment herein sought to be revived; but if said Rollins was present at said purchase, transacting his own business, then his failure to disclose to Smith any knowledge of the transfer to Dougherty, if he had such knowledge, would not affect the right of said bank in this case.” Appellants requested charges upon that subject, and assigned errors upon the refusal to give them. We are of opinion that the evidence tended to prove that Rollins acted in a dual capacity at the meeting of May 20, 1886. In so far as lie sought to be relieved as endorser upon the original Boatman Savings Bank judgment, he was acting for himself; but in the matter of the sale of the offsets to Smith, a part of the purchase money for which he turned over to the First National Bank, he was acting in behalf of said bank; and that the charge should have submitted to the jury the theory of this dual capacity, or rather that if he was acting in behalf of the bank, and at the same time acting in his own interest, his acts would be binding upon the bank. The charge copied in the transcript contains, after the words 11 transacting his own business,” the following, “ or was not in pursuance of his authority transacting the business of the bank, then,” etc. While we think the use of “and” instead of “or” would have more clearly expressed the theory above indicated, we are of opinion that the jury probably understood the charge to mean what was doubtless intended to be expressed, and hence this assignment is not well taken. It may be that the court should have also submitted in connection with said charge some appropriate instruction, presenting the theory, as claimed by Rollins, that at the meeting on the 20th of May, 1886, said Smith promised to pay the balance due on the bank debt, and that but for this promise he would not have acted as he did; but this is a matter of which the appellants could not complain. The proposition asserted by appellants in their nineteenth assignment, to the effect that the court should have charged that the insolvency of the Stone Cattle and Pasture Company prevented any preference of its creditors by its president, and therefore rendered invalid the assignment of said judgments to Dougherty, could not avail them in this suit, for the obvious reason that they do not seek an equitable distribution of its assets, but are striving earnestly to secure a preference over other creditors by offsetting the only valuable judgments owned by said company as assets with its greatly depreciated if not worthless paper at its face value. Lang v. Dougherty, 74 Texas, 226. The thirty-fifth assignment, by which complaint is made that the court should have charged to find for defendants, because the proof showed that the judgments sought to be revived were owned by the Boatman Savings Bank as collateral security, and the debt for which they were pledged was owned by defendant Smith, and plaintiff had not redeemed or offered to redeem said collateral securities, is equally untenable. Appellants, under the facts disclosed in this record, can not invoke this principle. The seventeenth assignment is as follows: “That portion of the fifth clause of the charge to the effect, that if II. T-Iulen employed J. W. Sacra to assist in buying the offsets, and that if the amount to be paid by Smith for the service was to be shared between them, and that this fact was known to J. P. Smith or assented to by him, or, if not known to him, was afterward ratified or recognized by Smith, then Smith would be charged with and affected by the notice of Sacra, was erroneous and calculated to mislead.” Delivered October 25, 1892. This assignment presents to us the question of greatest difficulty in the case. It is assumed by the parties to this litigation that the transaction between Smith and I-Iulen established the relation of principal and agent between them. It is contended by appellee that the transaction between Hulen and Sacra, coupled with the fact that Smith paid to Sacra, at the instance of Hulen, one-half of the sum of money he had agreed to pay Hulen, rendered Sacra also the agent of Smith, and hence that the knowledge on Sacra’s part of the assignment of the judgments sought to be revived should be imputed to Smith, though he had acquired title to the offsets prior to his knowledge of the fact that Sacra was in any way interested with Hulen in the matter. He relies upon the principle, which is well sustained by authority, that if one without authority assumes to act as the agent of another, and the latter takes the benefit of the unauthorized act by claiming rights under it or otherwise ratifying it, he must take such benefit charged with notice of such matters as appear to have been within the knowledge of the unauthorized agent at the time of the transaction. On the other hand, it is contended that the doctrine, which is also sustained by authority, that if the subagent be the agent of the agent merely, then there is no privity between him and the principal, and his knowledge can not be imputed to the principal, is applicable to the facts of this case. We have been cited to no case directly in point; and as the tendency of modern decisions is rather toward a restriction than an extension of the doctrine of implied or constructive notice in respect to agency, we are of opinion that the charge, in so far as it instructed the jury on the subject of ratification and notice as a result therefrom, was not applicable to the facts of this case. It seems to us, that when Smith purchased and paid for the notes in ignorance, as claimed by him, of the connection of Sacra with the matter, his rights were fixed and should not be prejudiced by the fact that afterward, upon the request of Hulen, he paid to Sacra one-half the sum he had agreed to pay Hulen under the contract with him. The. other assignments, we think, are not well taken. For the errors indicated above, the judgment will be reversed and the cause íemanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded. A motion for rehearing was overruled in this case.","J. P. Smith et al. v. J. W. Wilson and Boatman Savings Bank, for use of F. M. Dougherty. No. 7. 1. Practice — Special Exceptions to Pleadings.— Special exceptions to the form of the adversary pleadings come too late after there has been a trial and a continuance of the case at a former term without objection on this account. 2. Practice — Immaterial Error. — Beading to the jury a portion of the pleadings to which exceptions have been sustained is a practice not to be commended ; but held, in this case not to constitute reversible error. 3. Evidence — Written Instruments — Objection as to Effect of.— An objection to written instruments, going rather to their effect than to their admissibility, held, not a tenable ground for excluding them when offered in evidence. See the facts. 4. Evidence — Privileged Communication. — A confidential communication between attorney and client is the privilege of the client; and where he does not object to evidence on this ground, his antagonist in the litigation can not urge such client’s privilege against the evidence. 5. Evidence — Verbal Act — Res Gestae. — Where the proof shows the deposit of notes with an attorney, statements as to the purpose for which they are so deposited, made at the time and by the person depositing them, are not hearsay, but are verbal acts coming clearly within the rule on that subject. 6. Notice to Attorney Binding on Client, when. — Notice to either member of a firm of attorneys is binding on their client where it relates to a matter contemplated in the scope of their employment; and knowledge of the attorney as to such matter is imputed to the client. 7. Charge of the Court — Different Theories of the Case. — Where the evidence is conflicting, the defendant is entitled to a charge pertinently submitting his theory of the case to the jury. 8. Agent of Corporation — Officer Acting in Dual Capacity. — Where one who is an officer of an incorporated bank acts in a given matter in behalf of the bank, his acts are binding on the corporation, although at that time and in the same matter he may have been acting also in his individual inerest. 9. Principal and Agent — Acts Binding, when — Ratification.—The tendency of modern decisions is rather toward a restriction than an extension of the doctrine of implied or constructive notice in respect to agency; and in this case the knowledge of a subagent, whose appointment the principal had not authorized, is not imputed to the principal because of an act of the principal having some of the features of a ratification. 10.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This suit was brought, November 8, 1889, in the District Court of Johnson County, by the Texas Water and Gas Company, for the use of T. R. Bonner, E. C. Williams, and J. B. Henderson, against the city of Cleburne. The plaintiff prays as follows: 1. For a decree specifically enforcing a certain contract, by which the appellee agreed to issue and deliver fifty-one good and valid bonds of $1000 each, in payment for certain water works constructed for appellee by appellant, and for interest which has accrued upon said contract since its completion by appellant, and for a writ of mandamus to enforce such decree. 2. For the recovery of the value of said water works, alleged to be the sum of $51,000, in the event that the court should refuse specific performance. 3. For the recovery of the water works themselves, together with all the rents, issues, and profits, and the right to operate the same as now located in the city of Cleburne, in the event that the court should refuse to decree specific performance or to give judgment for the value of the water works. The facts relied upon by appellant for recovery, as alleged in its petition, are as follows: On September 13, 1883, the city of Cleburne adopted an ordinance authorizing its mayor and city secretary to execute a cbntract with appellant for the construction of a system of water works, and on compliance by appellant with its contract, to execute and deliver to it fifty-one bonds for $1000 each, due twenty years after date, with forty coupons, for $35 each, attached to each bond, the coupons falling due semi-annually, the last maturing July 1, 1905. The ordinance provided that the revenues realized from the operation of the water works, over and above the expenditures, should constitute a fund to pay the interest and create a sinking fund for the final redemption of the bonds. It further ordained, for the purpose of paying said interest, the levy of an annual tax of one-fourth of 1 per cent on each $100 worth of property in the city; and it further ordained, in order to pay said interest and to provide a sinking fund for the redemption of the bonds, the levy of an additional tax of one-tenth of 1 per cent, to be collected under the power of the city 1 ‘ to levy and collect annual taxes to defray the current expenses of the local government.” This levy of one-tenth of 1 per cent was to be inoperative if it should be found that the preceding levy would be sufficient to pay the interest and sinking fund referred to. On September 13, 1883, the city of Cleburne, through its mayor, W. N. Hodge, and its city secretary, W. H. Graves, under the authority of said ordinance, entered into a contract with appellant. On the part of the Texas Water and Gas Company it was agreed to construct, on or before June 1, 1884, a complete system of water works, to be submitted to a prescribed test in the presence of a committee of aldermen of the city, on a favorable report from which the company was to be discharged from further obligation on the contract. On the part of the city it was agreed to deliver to the Texas Water and Gas Company, on its com-' pliance with the conditions named, the bonds and coupons described in the ordinance. In pursuance of its contract, the company completed the water works by July 3, 1884, and submitted them to the test provided for; they were accepted by the city, which, in the language of the petition, “ took charge of them, and has ever since owned, held, and operated them as its own property and for its own use, benefit, and profit.” On July 3, 1884, W. N. Hodge, as mayor, with the attestation of W. H. Graves, as city secretary of the city of Cleburne, delivered to the company the fifty-one bonds, together with the coupons, provided for in the contract and the ordinance. These bonds bear date January 1, 1884; they are endorsed 1 ‘ Registered on July 12, 1884. William J. Swain, Comptroller.” Each bond contains the recital that it is “ authorized by article 420, Revised Statutes of Texas, and by the ordinance already""set out in conformity to article 420.” Each also recites that it is secured by an ordinance of the city authorizing the levy and collection of a tax-of 35 cents on the $100 worth of property, to pay the interest and 2 per cent sinking fund. The purported date of these bonds, January 1, 1884, is not their true date. They were actually signed July 3, 1884, when W. N. Hodge had ceased to be mayor. From the fact, however, that the bonds were issued under the contract of September 13, 1883, and were printed and engraved prior to the date, January 1, 1884, when Hodge was the mayor, the city council adopted a resolution authorizing W. N. Hodge to sign the bonds as mayor. By virtue of this resolution, W. N. Hodge signed the bonds as mayor, and they were delivered to the company and accepted by it as valid bonds in payment of the $51,000 stipulated for by the contract. After its acceptance of the bonds, the plaintiff sold all of them to the parties for whose use this suit is brought, and received for them the money therefor. These parties are now the bona fide owners and holders of thirty-three of the bonds, with all the coupons attached thereto, which represent the interest beginning and running from July 1, 1884, and maturing semi-annually on the first days of January and July. In the latter part of the year 1884, certain coupons first maturing were cut and sold to W. N. Coler, Jr., a nonresident, who, payment being refused, brought suit in May, 1885, against the city of Cleburne in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas, to enforce the payment of the coupons. The suit so brought, No. 759, resulted, in February, 1887, in a verdict in favor of the defendant, on the ground that the bonds were not properly executed and that the coupons were void. From this judgment W. N. Coler, Jr., prosecuted an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which, on May 13, 1889, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, holding the bonds to be void, because they were signed by W. N. Hodge as mayor, when in fact he was but a private citizen. The plaintiff has in all things complied with its contract; it has completed the water works, which the defendant has accepted, used, and operated. The defendant has not paid the consideration of $51,000, according to the contract; it has not delivered fifty-one valid bonds, but it has issued fifty-one worthless bonds, which the plaintiff holds for the use of the parties named in this suit, and which, together with the coupons, plaintiff is ready to deliver up for cancellation. The defendant has paid no consideration for the water works, but has refused the demand of the plaintiff, made in the name and for the use of all the holders of the bonds, to execute and deliver fifty-one good and valid bonds according to its agreement. The defendant city addressed to the petition a general demurrer and divers special exceptions, all of which were sustained. The action of the court in sustaining this demurrer and these exceptions gives rise to the questions which we shall proceed to consider. 1. Was the city of Cleburne empowered, under the Constitution and laws of the State, to enter into the contract set out in the plaintiff’s petition ? If it was not so authorized, the plaintiff is not entitled to the decree for specific performance for which it prays. If Cleburne was a city of more than 10,000 inhabitants, this question would require an answer in the affirmative, because cities of the latter class, at the date of this contract, were empowered, for municipal purposes, including the purpose of protection against fire, here in contemplation, to levy a tax of 2£ per cent, a limit far in excess of that named in the contract under consideration. Muller v. City of Denison, ante, 293. The petition contains no averment that Cleburne is such a city, and the failure to so aver is the subject of appellee’s twelfth special exception. As the purpose of the suit is to enforce the performance of a contract by the city, it would devolve upon appellant to prove that Cleburne was a city such as could enter into the contract in question. Gould v. City of Paris, 68 Texas, 518. Such proof would require corresponding allegations, and in their absence the petition would be obnoxious, at least to special exception such as was addressed to it. The appellant urges that the court erred in sustaining the general demurrer to its petition in this respect, and invokes the doctrine that on general demurrer every reasonable intendment will be indulged in favor of the sufficiency of the petition. As, however, in connection with the general demurrer, the court acted upon the special exception referred to, and as the latter was properly sustained, we do not think that the principle of pleading invoked by appellant is applicable. We are therefore to measure the authority of the city of Cleburne by the powers delegated to it as a city of 10,000 inhabitants or less, and, in this connection, to look to the constitutional and legislative provisions, the sole source of these powers. Article 420 of the Revised Statutes is the legislative authority relied upon to support the contract and the ordinance declared upon. The appellee contends that the constitutional provisions determining the authority of Cleburne were section 4, article 11, and section 9, article 8, of the Constitution of 1876, as it existed prior to the amendment of 1883; the appellant contends, on the other hand, that such authority is to be fixed by reference to these provisions of the Constitution as they existed after the amendment of 1883, enlarging the powers conferred upon municipalities in section 9, article 8. Construing article 420 of the Revised Statutes and the two sections referred to of the Constitution as it existed previous to the amendment of 1883, Willie, Chief Justice, in Gould v. City of Paris, 68 Texas, 518, concluded, in effect, that a city having 10,000 inhabitants or less had not the power to levy an annual tax exceeding one-fourth of 1 per cent, ‘1 except for the payment of debts already incurred, and for the erection of public buildings.” Excluding these excepted purposes, the power of the city ceased with the levy of one-fourth of 1 per cent for current expenses. As the construction of a system of water works comes neither within the description “ debts previously incurred,” nor “erection of public buildings,” it follows, if the petition in this case shows that the taxes contemplated by the contract are in excess of the one-fourth of 1 percent allowed for “ current expenses,” and if the Constitution as it existed prior to the amendment of 1883 was in force, that the contract sued upon was void. The power of the city to contract can not extend beyond the power of the city to tax. Gould v. City of Paris, 68 Texas, 516. The ordinance and the contract in question, as shown by the allegations of the petition, provided, first, for an absolute levy of one-fourth of 1 per cent, and, additionally, for a conditional levy of one-tenth of 1 per cent, the latter to be collected under the power to levy a tax to defray current expenses. It thus appears that the levy of one-fourth of 1 per cent was independent of the power to levy a tax for current expenses, and in excess of it, and that the levy of one-tenth of 1 per cent was contingent upon the levy of one-fourth of 1 per cent. Hence, we conclude that the tax provided for was unauthorized, and the contract was void, unless at the date thereof the Constitution as amended was in force. Under article 8, section 9, as amended, cities of the class of Cleburne were authorized, without reference to the tax for current expenses, to levy a tax not exceeding “ 25 cents on the $100, for the erection of public buildings, streets, sewers, and other public improvements;” the term “ public improvements,” including, as we think, such improvements as a system of water works. We will therefore consider the proposition of appellant, that the constitutional amendment was operative at the date of the contract alleged. The amendment in question was submitted by the Legislature April 7, 1883; it was ratified by vote August 14, 1883, and the result of the election in favor of its adoption was announced in the Governor’s proclamation September 25, 1883. The contract in question was entered into September 13, 1883. Article 17, section 1, of the Constitution, requires, when a vote has been had on the question of adopting a constitutional amendment, that the several returning officers shall make returns to the Secretary of State, whose duty it becomes (under article 1710, Revised Statutes), to count the returns of the election on the fortieth day after the election, and not before, excluding the day thereof. ‘ ‘And if it shall appear from said returns that a majority of the votes cast have been cast in favor of any amendment, the said amendment so receiving a majority of the votes shall become a part of this Constitution, and proclamation shall be made by the Governor thereof.” Article 17, as a part of the Constitution itself, must be deemed the expression of the people as to when their will, with reference to a change in the organic law, shall take effect. Its purpose, evidently, was to avoid that confusion which would probably result from too sudden a change in the frame of government, and which is naturally incident to the going out of the old order and the coming in of the new. Our Court of Appeals has, therefore, correctly held that the constitutional amendment does not become operative until after the lapse of the forty days above referred to. Sewell v. The State, 15 Texas Ct. App., 56; Wilson v. The State, 15 Texas Ct. App., 150; see also Real v. The People, 42 N. Y., 270. The rights, powers, and duties of the city of Cleburne under the contract are consequently to be considered without regard to the amendment of 1883. Appellant insists, however, that “the acts of performance (stated in the petition) are in themselves the creation of a contract, or such a ratification of the original as declare it a contract made after the amendment became a law.” These acts are as follows: (1) After the completion of the water works, in July, 1884, they were submitted to a test to prove their efficiency, in accordance with the terms of the contract, and they were accepted by the city, which ‘ ‘ took charge of them and has ever since held, owned, and operated them as its own property, and for its use, benefit, and profit.” (2) At said date, in July, 1884, the city council adopted a resolution empowering W. N. Hodge, as mayor, to sign the bonds provided for in the contract of September 13, 1883. As already stated, the authority under which it is claimed that this contract was made is contained in article 420 of the Revised Statutes. This article empowers the city to issue coupon bonds for the purpose of erecting water works; “provided, that the aggregate amount of bonds shall not at any time exceed 6 per cent of the value of the property within said city subject to an ‘ ad valorem ’ tax.” It is further provided in article 427 of the Revised Statutes, that “No debt shall ever be created by any city unless at the same time provision be made to assess and collect annually a sufficient sum to pay the annual interest thereon and create a sinking fund to pay 2 per cent thereon.” These are conditions upon which the power exists to issue the bonds or contract the indebtedness. City of Terrell v. Dessaint, 71 Texas, 770. The petition nowhere shows the value of the property within the city of Cleburne, nor is it alleged in connection with the foregoing facts that any provision was made to pay the debt in contemplation. The appellee, in its twelfth special exception, assails the petition as insufficient, because it does not allege any facts which would have authorized the defendant to create the indebtedness at the time of making the contract, or passing the ordinance, or issuing the bonds, or of the attempted creation of the indebtedness. Where one seeks to enforce an executory contract against a city, he must show that the contract is authorized by the statute, and where the existence of conditions is made, by statutory or organic law, necessary to the execution of the contract, he must aver such existence. A general allegation of authority is insufficient. Dill, on Mun. Cofp., sec. 509. It is essential that the mode prescribed by law in regard to municipal contracts be followed as well in the ratification as in the creation of the contract. 15 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 1086. The acts referred to under the deficient allegations of the petition are therefore certainly insufficient to create or ratify the contract. 2. The second prayer of appellant’s petition invites a discussion of the following question: Does the petition show that the city is bound by an implied contract for the value of the water works ? We do not, however, deem it necessary to discuss this question. If we grant that the facts alleged show an implied obligation, we are nevertheless constrained to sustain the defense of limitation urged by special exception to the demand. Bonner, Williams, and Henderson, for whose use this suit is brought, occupy an attitude certainly not more advantageous than the Texas Water and Gas Company, through which their rights arise. The implied liability to pay for the water works would exist, if at all, from the time that they were first accepted and appropriated by the city; and the cause of action upon such liability would be barred in two years. Gould v. Paris, 68 Texas, 511. The petition, therefore, showing that more than two years had elapsed after the accrual of the cause of action and before the bringing of this suit, the bar is complete. 3. We finally consider the question whether, under the facts stated in the petition, appellant is entitled to recover the water works themselves ? To this demand the city, by special exception, also interposes the defense of limitation. As already stated, the petition alleges, in effect, that on the 3d day of July, 1884, more than five years before the institution of this suit, the water works were accepted by the city, and “the city took charge of them and has ever since held, owned, and operated them as its own property, and for its own use, benefit, and profit.” The possession thus indicated was “hostile, actual, visible, notorious, and exclusive, continuous, and under a claim of title.’ ’ All the elements of adverse possession coexist. 1 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 228. If, therefore, the water works are to be regarded as personal property, the statute of two years applies, and the bar is complete against this demand. Connor v. Hawkins, 71 Texas, 582. , Delivered December 6, 1892. If, on the other hand, as appellant strenuously insists, the water works are to be considered a part of the realty, because attached as fixtures to the freehold, what is the consequence ? The realty to which they are so attached, and of which they are become a part, was and is necessarily held and owned by the city for public use. The city council could not, by contract, surrender its control over such property to any individual or corporation. Macdonell v. Railway, 60 Texas, 590. A judgment, therefore, compelling it to do that which by contract it was not authorized to do, or that which by law it is forbidden to do, could not be justified. In conclusion, we are of opinion that if the facts stated in the petition could entitle the plaintiff to any relief, it would be solely by virtue of an implied contract; and that, as the cause of action founded upon the implied contract, if it existed (which we do not decide), is clearly barred by the statute of limitation of two years, the judgment must be affirmed. It is consequently so ordered. Affirmed.","SECOND DISTRICT, DECEMBER, 1892. The Texas Water and Gas Company, for use of T. R. Bonner et al. v. The City of Cleburne. No. 24. 1. Municipal Bonds — Signature of Former Mayor. — While H. was mayor thereof, a city contracted to issue certain bonds, and the bonds were engraved and printed, but before their signature and delivery H. had ceased to be mayor. The city council, however, by resolution authorized him to sign the bonds as mayor, which he thereupon did. It seems that the bonds thus signed are worthless, and an action can not be maintained thereon. 2. Pleading — Averment of Authority of a City to Issue Bonds. Where a city is sued on a contract such as could have been lawfully made only by a city of over 10,000 inhabitants, the plaintiff’s petition is bad on special exception if it fails to allege that the defendant is incorporated as a city of over 10,000 inhabitants. 3. Municipal Taxation — Water Works — City of 10,000 or Less. Prior to the constitutional amendment of 1883 a city of 10,000 or less had not the power to levy an annual tax exceeding one-fourth of 1 per cent, except for the payment of debts already incurred, and for the erection of public buildings. A system of water works does not come within either of these two matters. 4. Amendment to Constitution Takes Effect, when. — An amendment to the Constitution does not become operative until after the lapse of forty days from the date of the election at which such amendment is adopted. 5. Municipal Power — Ratification by City of Unauthorized Contract — Pleading.—It is essential that the mode prescribed by law in regard to municipal contracts be followed in the ratification as well as in the making of the contract; and therefore where a city attempted to make a contract which it then has not legal power to make, if it be sought to hold the city liable thereon by virtue of a ratification made after the grant of enlarged power to the city, the pleadings must specifically show that at the time of the ratification the city then had authority to have made the contract, and that the ratification includes all conditions made by statute or organic law necessary to the existence of the contract, such as the condition that a city shall not create a debt without making at the same time provision for its payment., principal and interest. 6. Limitation of Two Years on Implied Contract by City. — The implied liability to pay for the water works would exist, if at all, from the time that they were first accepted and appropriated by the city, and the cause of action on such liability would he barred in two years. 7. Two Years Possession a Bar, when. — If a system of waterworks is to be regarded as personal property, and the city has taken exclusive charge of them and owned and operated them as its own property for more than two years prior to the filing of a suit to recover them, the statute of two years applies, and the bar is complete against such demand. 8. Municipal Authority — Water Works as Realty. — If water works of a city are to be considered as part of the realty because attached as fixtures to the freehold, then as such realty is necessarily held and owned by the city for public use, it can not by contract lawfully surrender its control over such property to any individual or corporation; and a court will not, therefore, render a judgment against a city for the recovery of water works and control thereof. Appeal from Johnson. Tried below before Hon. J. M. Hall. W. S. Herndon and B. B. Cain, for appellant. 1. The contract sued upon is one which the city had a right to make, and on general demurrer, if the law authorized it, the courts will enforce it. Every reasonable intendment arising upon the petition will be indulged in favor of its sufficiency. The contract is for construction of a system of water works, and is properly executed. It can not be presumed that the city had less than 10,000 inhabitants, or that the bonds contracted to be issued would be excessive. Such defenses are matters of fact to be pleaded by the defendant. Rev. Stats., arts, 374, 420; Const., sec. 9, art. 8; Rule 17, 47 Texas, 619; Prewitt v. Farris, 5 Texas, 371; Burks v. Watson, 48 Texas, 107; Johnson v. Dowling, 1 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 1094. 2. Although the city of Cleburne issued bonds in a manner not authorized by law, and no recovery could be had on the bonds per se, yet if the money derived therefrom, or in its stead the water works, was a purpose authorized by law, an action lies as for money had and received, and the bona fide holder of said bonds could recover as assignee of the original demand. Louisana v. Ward, 102 U. S., 294; Gauze v. City, 1 Fed. Rep., 357; Marsh v. Fulton, 10 Wall., 676; Burr on Pub. Secur., 508, et seq.; Porter v. Bright, 82 Pa. St., 421. 3. The question to be determined is whether or not such a contract is authorized. If it is in furtherance of some legitimate corporate purpose, the city is estopped from denying its liability on such contract. Herm. on Estop., sec. 1183; 14 Pet., 122; 12 Wall., 358; 107 U. S., 174, 676; 98 U. S., 621; Warner v. Munsheimer & Co., 2 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 393; Grande v. Chaves, 15 Texas, 550. 4. The doctrine of implied liability applies to a city where property is received or obtained by mistake or without authority of law. It is its duty to restore such property, not from contract entered into by it, but from the general obligation to do justice, which binds all persons, whether natural or artificial. If this property has not been converted or used, it is the duty of the city to restore it, or if used, to render its equivalent to the true owner. Augusta v. San Francisco, 16 Cal., 255; Gas Co. v. San Francisco, 9 Cal., 453; Alleghany City v. McClarker & Co., 14 Pa. St., 81; Dill, on Mun. Corp., secs. 384, 750; Nelson v. Mayor, 63 N. Y., 536. 5. No action accrued to these bondholders under their contract until the validity of these bonds was determined by the courts and it became res adjudícala. Therefore the action on quantum meruit is not barred. Wood on Lim., sec. 143; Ripley v. Withee, 27 Texas, 14. 6. If the statute does apply to the actions on quantum meruit and for specific performance, the action for possession of the property is not barred, because the possession by defendant has not been of such an adverse nature as would set the statute in motion. When adverse possession is claimed, the whole inquiry is into the quo animo or intent with which it is taken and held. As long as there was not some unequivocal act indicating an intention to acquire title without payment to this appellant, and no intention to do so on the part of appellee, the statute is motionless and can not be pleaded as a defense. Ang. on Lim., sec. 386; 5 Pet., 440; 11 Pet., 41; University v. McCune, 28 Mo., 481; Howard v. Reedy, 29 Ga., 152; Perkins v. Blood, 36 Vt., 273; Richard v. Neghlangate, 9 Allen, 149. 7. Under the circumstances of this case, equity will excuse the delay in bringing this suit. Kirma v. Smith, 3 N. J. Eq., 14; Preston v. Preston, 95 U. S., 200; Neeley’s Appeal, 85 Pa. St., 387; Reed v. West, 47 Texas, 240; Rogan v. Walker, 1 Wise, 631; Lawrence v. Raker, 61 Me., 38; McKnight v. Taylor, 1 How., 161. Crane & Ramsey, F. A. Fisher, and D. T. Bledsoe, for appellee.— 1. The contract sued upon is not one which the city had a right to make, but it is absolutely void, because the Constitution of the State, as it existed at the time said contract was made, prohibited cities of the class to which appellee belongs from levying or collecting any tax for the purpose mentioned in said contract. Const., sec. 4, art. 11; Const, (original), sec. 9, art. 8; Rev. Stats., art. 427; Gould v. Paris, 68 Texas, 511; Waxahachie v. Brown, 67 Texas, 520; Voorheis v. Mayor, 70 Texas, 339; Terrell v. Dessaint, 71 Texas, 770. 2. The contract is to be construed and the rights of the parties tested by the law in force at the time the contract was made, and the amendment of 1883 to section 9, article 8, of the Constitution, which did not take effect until after the contract was made, can not be considered as enlarging or extending the powers of the city or the rights of appellants thereunder. Const., sec. 2, art. 17; Sewell v. The State, 15 Ct. App., 57; State v. Morgan City, 32 La. Ann., 81; People v. Norton, 59 Barb., 169; University v. McIver, 72 N. C., 76; Concord v. Portsmouth, 92 U. S., 629; Marsh v. Fulton, 77 U. S., 682; Concord v. Robinson, 121 U. S., 166. 3. The petition does not allege any facts in reference to population, taxable values, or indebtedness of the city of Cleburne at the time the contract was made, such as would show that the city had lawful authority to have made the contract and levied the necessary tax. Const., sec. 9, art. 8, sec. 4, art. 11; Rev. Stats., arts. 420, 421, 424, 425, 427; Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 1187, and note 4; Gould v. Paris, 68 Texas, 511; Waxahachie v.

It not being shown that the city of Cleburne has the power to levy and collect the tax to pay the debt attempted to be created, the contract is void, and the city incurred no liability for work done under a void contract, nor was there guaranty on its part that compensation shall be made, because its officers, without authority, have attempted to contract.

The contract being void, because the city had no power to create the debt, there can be no implied liability arising out of or based upon such void transaction. Gould v. Paris, 68 Texas, 511; Bryan v. Page, 51 Texas, 532; Litchfield v. Ballou, 114 U. S., 132; Ins. Co. v. Middle-port, 124 U. S., 534; Daily v. San Francisco, 13 Pac. Rep., 321; Buchanan v. Litchfield, 102 U. S., 278; Otis v. Cullum, 92 U. S., 47. 6. The statute of limitations, as pleaded by appellee in the sixth, seventh, and eighth special exceptions to plaintiff’s petition, is a complete bar to any cause of action which either Bonner, Henderson, and Williams, or the Texas Water and Gas Company, may have ever had against appellee.

The law will not permit appellee to loan its credit, nor to surrender its authority or control over the streets and highways or any other property held and owned by the city for public use; and the court will not, by judgment or decree, compel the city to do any act which it can not lawfully do by contract. Macdonell v. Railway, 60 Texas, 590; Cleburne v. Brown, 73 Texas, 443."
"FISHER, Chief Justice. The appellee instituted suit against the appellant in the District Court of Medina County, Texas, on the 17th day of May, 1888, to recover the alleged value at St. Joseph, Missouri, of two carloads (49) horses shipped on July 26, 1887, by appellee from New Braunfels, Texas, to St. Joseph, Missouri, alleging their value at St. Joseph, Missouri, to be $1960. Appellee alleged, that appellant failed-and refused to deliver said horses to appellee upon his demand at St. Joseph, Missouri, although appellee had tendered to appellant all freight and charges which appellee claimed for transportation and feed, etc. Appellant answered by general denial, and that stock was shipped upon two special contracts at a reduced rate of freight made on July 26, .1887, by appellee and Kenneth D. Wheatley with the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, which was at that time the lessee of the appellant. The said shipment was made as, and was in fact an interstate shipment. That the conditions of said contracts stipulated that in casé of loss or damage of any kind for which the Missouri Pacific Railway Company should be liable, then and in that event said company should only be required to pay the value of said horses so damaged at New Braunfels on date of shipment, and that the value of said horses when shipped at New Braunfels, Texas, did not exceed $19 per head. That appellant, though a common carrier and bound to the public for torts committed by its lessee, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, generally, could only be held liable for the torts of its lessee committed in the performance of some duty appellant as such owed to the public. That as such common carrier appellant did not owe it to the public to make interstate shipments, and if appellee saw fit to enter contracts for interstate shipments of his horses, then he must look to the lessee for his damages, and that he has no right to hold appellant responsible for such damages caused by its lessee, and that appellant is only liable in such cases for the damage done while said horses were being transported upon its own line. Trial was had and a verdict and judgment were rendered for the appellee against the appellant for $1525. The court erred in refusing to give to the jury the following charge requested by appellant: “ The defendant asks the court to instruct the jury that, if they believe from the evidence that the Missouri Pacific Railway Company made and entered into the contracts set up by the defendant to ship these animals beyond the line of the International & Great Northern Railway, then the International & Great Northern Railway is not liable for any damages that occurred to plaintiff’s horses beyond the line of its road.” The evidence in the record shows that appellee entered into two written contracts of shipment with the Missouri Pacific Railway Company to ship horses from New Braunfels, Texas, to St. Joseph, Missouri. There is a clause in each contract limiting the liability of the carrier to its own line. The cause of action is based upon the refusal of the railway company to deliver the horses to appellee after they had arrived at St. Joseph, Missouri. While the evidence is not clear in showing that the horses in controversy were the same covered by the two contracts of shipment with the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and which were delivered at St. Joseph by that road, still it is sufficient to entitle the appellant to have submitted to the jury the issues raised by the special charge. The number of horses, the date of shipment, the place where shipped from, the place of destination, and the names of the consignors and consignees as stated in the written contracts of shipment correspond with the evidence of appellee and witness Wheatley. The witnesses for appellant speak of the horses being delivered at St. Joseph, Missouri, by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company. Such in effect is their testimony on the subject. Under these facts, it should have been left to the jury to determine whether these horses were covered by the written contracts of shipment ■ with the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and whether they were carried into St. Joseph, Missouri, by that road. Such evidence would have a tendency to show that the horses were covered by the contracts of shipment with the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and that they had passed out of the possession of appellant at the time such delivery was refused appellee, and that at such time they had gone into possession of another carrier. If this should be the effect of the evidence, the appellant would be entitled to the benefit of the clause in the written contracts exempting the carrier from liability for damages resulting on other than its own lines. Such exemption made by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company in the written contracts of shipment would result to the benefit of each carrier over whose lines the horses may be transported. McCarn v.

Limited Liability of Railway Company— Contract by Lessee — The Missouri Pacific Railway Company, holding a lease upon the International & Great Northern Railway Company, contracted to carry two carloads of horses from New Braunfels, Texas, and to safely deliver the freight at St. Joseph, in the State of Missouri. The freight contract limited the liability for damages to losses upon its own line. ' The horses were carried to St. Joseph, but not delivered to the shipper. In an action against the International & Great Northern Railway Company for the value of the horses, held, that the exemption in the contract would inure to the benefit of each carrier over whose line the horses were carried, and the defendant would not be liable for the refusal to deliver at St. Joseph.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. This suit was instituted by appellee in the Justice Court for Precinct No. 1, Denton County, Texas, to recover of appellant $145 damages, alleged to have been caused him by the killing by appellant of one mare of the value of $75 and one horse of the value of $70. Judgment was rendered in favor of appellee in the Justice Court for the sum of $125, and the case was taken by appellant by appeal to the County Court, and in that court judgment was rendered in favor of appellee for the sum of $145. There is nothing in the transcript showing what the pleadings of the parties were either in the Justice or County Court. Article 1573 of the Revised Statutes provides that, “The pleadings in the Justice Court shall be oral, except where otherwise specially provided, but a brief statement thereof shall be noted on the docket.” Without something in the record to apprise us what the issues between the parties were, as contained in their pleadings, whether they be oral or written, it is impossible for us to pass upon errors assigned to charges given and refused, or to the admission or rejection of evidence, and we will not undertake to do so.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This suit was brought by appellee against appellant, an express company, in a Justice Court, to recover damages for injury to fruit trees, claimed by appellee to have resulted from negligent delay of appellant in delivering. The case was tried in the Justice Court and appealed to the District Court, where a judgment was rendered in appellee’s favor, from which this appeal is taken. The facts are as follows: Appellee lived in Newton County, and had the trees shipped by express to Orange. He saw a notice in a newspaper published at Orange, of date December 20, 1888, and in another of December 27, 1888, that the trees were in appellant’s office there. On January 3,1889, he gave to one Nations the following order: “B. B. Agent, Orange: ■ “ Dear Sir — Please deliver to the bearer any freight I may have in your possession, and oblige, “Yours truly, “T. J. Windham.”. The bearer carried the note to Orange and handed it to one Brooks, who was the agent both of the railroad company and of appellant. Brooks read the order, and said there was nothing for Mr. Windham. Nothing further passed between them. Nations returned to Newton without the trees, and by the delay thus occasioned, the trees, when received by appellee, were damaged. It was shown that freight received by the railroad company and express matter received by appellant at Orange were kept in the same room. The trees were consigned to appellee in care of the railroad agent at Orange. The only question raised in the briefs is, whether or not the order presented to Brooks, under the circumstances stated, was a sufficient demand for the trees in the hands of appellant to make it his duty to deliver them to Nations, and to charge appellant with liability for the damages resulting from his failure to do so. There was nothing in the order itself to direct Brooks’ attention to matter held by him as agent of appellant, but its address to the railroad agent and the terms employed were rather calculated to mislead him than otherwise. Appellee knew that his goods were in the express office, but neither by the order nor by communication through his agent did he bring to the attention of the agent the fact that he was inquiring for express matter. Delivered November 17, 1892. To hold this sufficient would, it seems to us, defeat the purpose of the law in requiring a demand. Again, this order only authorized the railroad agent to deliver freight in his possession. How could he know, from the face of the paper, that Nations was authorized to receive matter in the possession of the express company. The fact that he was agent of both companies did not diminish his duties to each. Great care must be exercised by express companies to deliver goods to the right person, and heavy liabilities may result from a delivery to one not authorized to receive. A written authority from a ""consignee to a third person should not be so uncertain as to give just grounds for doubting the scope of the authorization. Appellee contends, that the trees being consigned in care of the railroad agent, it was Brooks’ duty to transfer the possession to himself in his capacity of railroad agent, and then in the same capacity to deliver them to Nations. This assumes that such a demand was made upon him as to direct his attention to the trees and require him to act. This, we have seen, was not the case. It is to be borne in mind that the trees had been in the office for three weeks, and it would be unreasonable to expect an express agent to remember at all times and upon a moment’s notice the names of all consignees for whom he has goods. Besides, as railroad agent, Brooks owed no duty to appellee, and was not bound to receive the trees. We must conclude that the failure of the agent to deliver the trees resulted from the fault of appellee and his agent; and the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and judgment will here be rendered in appellant’s favor. Reversed and, rendered.","Wells, Fargo & Co. v. T. J. Windham. No. 30. 1. Insufficient Demand for Freight. — An order by the consignee of fruit trees which had been shipped by express, as follows, “ E. B. agent, Orange— Please deliver to the bearer any freight 1 may have in your possession.” the railroad agent being also express agent, is not a sufficient demand for the trees held by him as express agent to make it his duty to deliver them, or to charge the express company with the damage resulting from a failure to do so. 2. W ritten Order. — The fact that the agent was agent for both companies did not diminish his duties to each. From the order given he could not know that its bearer was authorized to receive express freight. A written authority from a consignee to a third person should not be so uncertain as to give just grounds for doubting the scope of the authorization; as great care must be taken by express agents to deliver goods to the proper person, and heavy liabilities' may result from a wrong delivery. 3. Practice in Court of Civil Appeals. — The arrival of the trees was advertised on December 20. and it was seen by the consignee, who on January 3 following sent the order described in paragraph 1; to which the agent replied that there was nothing for Windham. The order not being such as to direct the agent’s attention to the trees, the failure to deliver them resulted from the fault of the appellee, and the judgment in his favor for damages is here reversed, and rendered for the appellant.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This suit was brought in the District Court of Harrison County on February 4, 1887, by the appellee, John H. Lee, to rescind a certain deed and recover of John T. Pierce a tract of land situated in Tarrant County. Pierce died after the institution of the suit, and the appellant, Cooper, became the administrator of his estate, with will annexed, and was made a party defendant to the suit. Annie L. Pierce, the widow, and John L. and Hope Pierce, the children,' and Mattie and Richard Godbold, also minors and devisees in the will, were also made defendants, and special guardians were appointed to represent said minors. The defendants Annie E. Pierce and her children disclaimed any interest in the land. This is the second appeal, and the first will be found reported in 75 Texas, 114. After the former judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court the pleadings in the case were amended to meet the views of that court with reference to the question of limitation, and to excuse the plaintiff for his failure to bring his action within four years from the date of the execution of the deed. Plaintiff’s amended petition charged substantially, that on the-day of November, 1881, plaintiff was the owner of a large and valuable tract of land in Tarrant County, Texas, which was described in an exhibit to the petition; that said John T. Pierce, on or about said day and date, came to plaintiff and represented to him that it would be greatly to his advantage to exchange said tract of land for another tract or tracts which he, the said Pierce, owned, and that plaintiff, influenced by said representations, and trusting said defendant on account of the relations existing between them, consented to said exchange, and about said date executed to said Pierce a deed for said land. That the sole consideration for the conveyance of said land to Pierce, was the other tracts of land mentioned, which defendant pretended to own, and for which he at the same time executed a deed to plaintiff. That plaintiff was the father-in-law of Pierce, and lived in Pierce’s house as a member of his family up to the time of his death. Pierce was an attorney at law, and as such acted in this, as in all other matters, for the plaintiff. On account of these confidential relations he reposed the utmost confidence in said Pierce. That both the deeds were prepared by Pierce or under his supervision, and that plaintiff, on account of the trust reposed by him in said Pierce, did not read the deed executed by the latter to him, and did not know the contents of the same. That at the time of the execution of said deeds Pierce represented to plaintiff that it would be greatly to the interest of both parties not to record either of said deeds; that shortly after the execution of the deed from Pierce to plaintiff on or about May, 1884, said Pierce, knowing that plaintiff had not recorded his deed, called on plaintiff and requested him to let him (Pierce) see the deed, which plaintiff did, and delivered the same to Pierce; that Pierce had never returned said deed, but had refused to do so, and plaintiff had no means of ascertaining what lands had been conveyed thereby. Pierce, contrary to his representations and agreement, immediately placed on record in Tarrant County the deed which plaintiff had executed to him; that plaintiff was informed, and believed and averred, that Pierce had no title to the lands which he pretended to convey to plaintiff in exchange for the Tarrant County land, and that his intention was to defraud the plaintiff and obtain the deed from him without any consideration. Plaintiff did not claim, and had never, since he discovered Pierce’s fraudulent intent, claimed any right, title, or interest in the lands which Pierce pretended to convey to him, and renounced any and all right under said deed or deeds, by which Pierce pretended to convey to him said lands, and offered to reconvey the same to the administrator for the use of said Pierce’s estate. That plaintiff did not learn that Pierce would not return to him the deed, which he had obtained under the pretext of looking at it, until the-day of November, 1886, at which time he refused to return the same to plaintiff. Said deed was charged to be in the possession of the defendant or the administrator of Pierce’s estate, and notice was given to defendant to produce the sainé at the trial. Plaintiff averred that said Pierce, after he had obtained from plaintiff the possession of the deed or deeds, by which he had pretended to convey the lands to plaintiff, sold and conveyed said lands or a portion thereof, situated in Hill County, to Tarleton, Jordan & Tarleton, who were innocent purchasers, by which he defeated whatever title plaintiff may have acquired from him. To this petition the defendant interposed a general demurrer, and excepted specially, in substance: 1. That if ever plaintiff had any cause of action, it had been barred by the statute of limitation. 2. The alleged reasons for not having sooner discovered the alleged fraud were not sufficient to excuse the plaintiff for not having brought his action within four years after the date of the deed. a. Said amended petition showed no such facts of fraud, accident, or mistake, as would entitle plaintiff to his equitable action of rescission m the premises. 4. That it appeared from the petition that whatever cause of action plaintiff had, he was fully advised long before the institution of the suit, and as his action was not instituted within a reasonable time after the discovery of the alleged fraud, he should be held to have ratified the sale. 5. That plaintiff showed no reason why he did not take and use the ordinary legal diligence to protect his title to the lands, as he was by law required to do; that he was in nowise prompted by Pierce or any one else, but failed to do so by his own laches and negligence. Defendants further answered by general denial, and a plea of not guilty, and pleaded specially to the statute of limitations; that the alleged fraudulent acts of Pierce by the exercise of ordinary diligence might have become known to Lee within one year thereafter; that plaintiff failed to act promptly and within a reasonable time to rescind the sale. Defendants also pleaded that the conveyance was made with the fraudulent intent to hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of plaintiff, especially the beneficiaries in the bond of A. Pope as administrator of the estate of Rene Fitzpatrick, deceased, upon which plaintiff was one of the sureties; and that plaintiff ought not to be allowed to renounce and rescind said sale and recover back said land. In reply to the answer of defendants, plaintiff filed a supplemental petition, alleging that at the time Pierce procured the deed from plaintiff for the Tarrant County land, he, as counsel for plaintiff, advised him to make such deed, representing to him that it would be greatly to his pecuniary advantage so to do, and in this way, as well as by the fact that Pierce was the son-in-law of plaintiff, who was then a member of his, said Pierce’s, family, plaintiff was induced to make said deed. That Pierce was plaintiff’s confidential adviser in all matters; was the agent of plaintiff and acted for him in all business matters, especially in rendering for taxation his property to the assessors, and paying taxes. He also had in his hands all the money and available claims and credits which belonged to plaintiff, and acted for plaintiff in everything; that said agency and attorneyship continued in full force during all the time up to November, 1886, and he did during all the said time all the acts required by his agency, especially assessing property and paying taxes, and he used all the advantages arising from his position to conceal from plaintiff his fraudulent design to defraud plaintiff and the fact that he had not title to said land. That at said time Pierce had deliberately formed the design to defraud plaintiff by obtaining from him without consideration all of his property, and fraudulently represented that he owned the lands, which he pretended to give in exchange for the plaintiff’s lands, when, in truth and in fact, he did not own the same. That plaintiff’s eyesight and memory were then impaired by age, and he had either not read the deed, or if he had read it, he had forgotten the fact, and could not state the contents thereof. Pierce had advised plaintiff not to record his deed, and relying on Pierce as his lawyer and sOn-in-law, he had failed to do so. That when, on May —, 1884, Pierce requested plaintiff to allow him to examine the deed, he fraudulently represented that he merely wanted to look over it, and deceitfully promised to return the same, but he really intended to possess himself of said deed, so that he might destroy or suppress the same, which he did. That owing to the implicit confidence which the plaintiff reposed in said Pierce, he did not learn of his fraudulent design in reference to said land until the <— day of November, 1886, at which time said Pierce refused to return said deed to him. Plaintiff averred that he did not learn that Pierce had no title to the lands which he pretented to give in exchange for said Tarrant County land until long after his refusal to return said deed; that the lands which Pierce pretended to give in exchange were situated in a distant part of the State, and plaintiff had no access to. the title papers to the same, nor to the record of such papers, and that Pierce fraudulently withheld the fact that the title to his said lands was bad, and adroitly concealed, by false promises and many professions of honesty, his intention to suppress said deed, and keep the Tarrant County land; and the plaintiff, who was very old and without money, could not, by any diligence, discover the wrong which Pierce was meditating. Trial was had by a jury, September 17, 1890, after the court had overruled the defendant’s demurrers; a verdict was returned for the plaintiff, and judgment was rendered in his favor, rescinding the deed and for the recovery of the land sued for; from which the present appeal has been taken, and a reversal thereof is sought upon numerous assignments of error, upon the action of the court in overruling the defendant’s demurrers, the admission and exclusion of evidence, and in giving and refusing charges. The facts, briefly stated, are: John T. Pierce was the son-in-law of the appellee, John H. Lee. From the year 1875 to his death in 1888, Pierce was an attorney at law, and as such acted for Lee from 1881 to 1887. He was also Lee’s business.manager, gave in his property for taxes, paid taxes, brought suits, and gave Lee. advice. At the time of the trial in 1890, Lee was eighty-two years old, and his eyesight was defective, but he could see better in 1881. He was able to read and write. He lived during the time from 1881 to 1887 ’ with Pierce. Had property subject to taxation, but did not give it in or pay taxes on it. It does not appear that Lee owned any property other than that conveyed to him by Pierce in November, 1881, except a farm called the “ Smith place,” .the title to which stood in Pierce’s name, and for which this suit was also originally brought, and a tract in Jack County. About November 1,1881, Pierce, by representations through his wife, procured a conveyance from Lee for the Tarrant County land, in exchange for lands which he conveyed to Lee, and which he represented to be more in quantity and far more valuable than that received from Lee. Pierce prepared the deeds for the land and delivered Lee his. These deeds were: 1. Deed from John II. Lee to John T. Pierce for the land in controversy, dated November 1, 1881, acknowledged November 2, 1881, and recorded in Tarrant County January 24, 1882; consideration expressed, $2500. 2. Quitclaim deed, from John T. Pierce to John H. Lee, for an expressed consideration of $500, for all Pierce’s right, title, and interest in the O. P. Kelter one-third league in Harris County, as shown by deed of conveyance from heirs of Alexander McCown to Pierce. This deed was acknowledged by Pierce November 2, 1881. It appears to have come from the custody of defendants, and does not appear to have ever been recorded. 3. Deed from John T. Pierce to John H. Lee, dated November 1,1881, acknowledged November 2, 1881, for an expressed consideration of $2500, conveying an undivided one-half interest in and to three tracts of land in Hill County, fully described. This deed appears to have come from the custody of defendants, and does not appear to have ever been recorded.. It was shown that Pierce afterward, by his warranty deed, dated April 23, 1884, and recorded in Hill County July 14, 1884, conveyed to Tarlton, Jordan & Tarlton, for a consideration of $2000, the lands in that county before conveyed by him to Lee. Lee testified that he did not know where the lands conveyed to him by Pierce were situated, and that he had never received anything from them. Several months after the exchange of the lands Pierce asked Lee to let him see the deeds which he had given him. Lee handed them to Pierce, who looked at them and said, “ These-are the ones,” and carried them off. These deeds were never returned to Lee. In the latter part of 1886 Lee asked Pierce for a settlement and a return of his deeds. Pierce refused to give up the deeds or make a settlement. Lee was a surety on the bond of A. Pope, as administrator of the estate of Rene Fitzpatrick, in the sum of $2500, executed in 1867. Suit was instituted on said bond October 6,1881, and Lee was a party thereto. He had final judgment in his favor in November, 1885. If the suit had gone against Lee it would have been his financial ruin, as expressed by himself.- On the former appeal of this case it was held, that if the transaction in which Pierce procured the conveyance from Lee was fraudulent, Lee would have a cause of action for its rescission growing out of the transaction itself, and that four years is the period prescribed by our statute within which such action shall be brought. 75 Texas, 121. This, we think, disposes of the exception of defendants to the petition that the suit must be brought within a reasonable time from the date of the transaction, or from the discovery of the fraud, and that such reasonable time Was a question of law for the court to determine. In this case the appellee had four years within which to bring his suit from the date of the deed which he sought to rescind; or if he did not then immediately discover the fraud which he alleged had been practiced in securing said deed from him, then within four years from the time of the discovery of such fraud; provided, that it must be discovered within a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time would vary according to the facts and circumstances attending and subsequent to the transactions which, in their nature, tend to prevent a discovery of the fraud; and it would sometimes be a mixed question of law and of fact. There was no error in submitting the question of . reasonable time to the jury, if the facts alleged in the petition are of such a nature as ought to excuse the plaintiff, Lee, from discovering the fraud, which, he alleged, had been practiced upon him by Pierce. We think the allegations were sufficient. As alleged in the petition, Lee was an old man, and resided with Pierce, who was his son-in-law; and, as an attorney-at-law, was his legal adviser, as well as his agent for the transaction of all his business. The deeds for the land were prepared by Pierce, and delivered to Lee with the advice not to record them. Relying on Pierce’s representations as to the deeds, and the value of the lands, and to pay taxes, there was no occasion for Lee to examine the deeds, or inquire after the lands. The time which elapsed from the date of the transaction until the suit was instituted, was about fifteen months more than the period of limitation. We are not prepared to say, as a matter of law, that this was not a reasonable time, and that the fraud should have been sooner discovered. Plaintiff’s petition also showed a good cause of action for the rescinding of the deed. Defendant’s demurrer and exceptions, as presented in the first five assignments of error, were properly overruled. On the trial m the court below, the defendants objected to the introduction in evidence, by the plaintiff, of the deed executed by Pierce to Tarlton, Jordan & Tarlton, April 24, 1884, for the Hill County land, because it was a transaction occurring long after the fraud practiced on Lee in 1881; was calculated to prejudice Lee with the jury; and was done long after the expiration of the time within which Lee should have discovered the fraud. The rule of evidence in cases of fraud is liberal, and justly so. In this case it was alleged that Pierce procured the conveyance of the Tarrant County lands in order to defraud the plaintiff; and that plaintiff had not received any value for them; that when Pierce delivered the deeds to Lee, he advised him not to record them, and, sometime afterward, induced Lee to return them to him. The evidence tended to show the fraudulent design of Pierce from the beginning as a culmination thereof, and was admissible for that purpose. Appellants rely upon numerous assignments of error, which they have failed to copy in their brief, and which are objected to by appellee on that ground and others. These relate to the admission of evidence, and the refusal of the court to give special instructions requested by the defendants, and do not present any fundamental errors of law. Rule 29 of Supreme Court, in force when the brief of appellants was prepared, is as follows: “ The appellant, or plaintiff in error, in order to prepare properly a case for submission when called, shall have filed a brief of the points relied on, in accordance with and confined to the distinct specifications of error (which assignments shall be copied into the brief) and to such fundamental errors of law as are apparent upon the record, each ground of error being separately presented under the proper assignment; and each assignment not so copied and accompanied with its appropriate propositions and statements, shall be regarded as abandoned.” This rule has been adopted recently by the Supreme Court as one of the rules for the Courts of Civil Appeals. Whether invoked by the appellee or not, we think that this and other rules should be enforced; and because they are not copied in the brief, as required by the rules, we will regard as abandoned the assignments from the seventh to the thirtieth, inclusive, and will not consider the same. The thirty-first assignment of error is as follows: “ The court erred in the charge to the jury, specially in the following particulars: 1. Because it fails to instruct the jury that the burden of proving an excuse for Lee’s delay in bringing suits was on Lee. 2. Because it did not charge that the burden was on Lee to show that he had not been guilty of ordinary neglect in failing to discover before February 4, 1883, the fraud practiced by Pierce in obtaining from Lee the conveyance sought to be canceled. 3. Because the definition of ordinary diligence and care, as given in the charge, is incorrect as applied to this case and was misleading to the jury. 4. The charge gives improper directions as to how they should determine upon Lee’s excuse for failing to discover the fraud practiced in November, 1881, before the 4th of February, 1883, as the age, relationship, and condition of the parties would furnish no excuse for any lack of diligence on Lee’s part, and could only be considered by the jury in determining whether Pierce’s acts were sufficient to defeat ordinary diligence on Lee’s part for a year, three months, and three days.” The first and second particulars in the assignment relate to omissions in the charge, which should have been corrected by appropriate instructions requested by the defendants, and the omission to charge on the burden of proof in the respect pointed out, is not a cause for the reversal of the judgment. Upon the issue as to whether or not the fraud might not have been discovered by Lee, the jury was instructed by the court: “If you believe that Lee exercised ordinary diligence and care, and did not discover the fraud, if any was committed by Pierce, prior to February 4, 1883, or if, by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, Lee could not have learned of the fraud, if any was committed by Pierce, before the 4th of February, 1883, then the cause of action is not barred by limitation. What is meant by ordinary diligence and care, is such diligence and care as men of ordinary prudence exercise with reference to their own property.” There is nothing prejudicial to the defendants in this instruction. It is rather more favorable to them than otherwise. It was proper also to instruct the jury to take into consideration all of the attendant circumstances which would tend to excuse Lee from any lack of diligence in the discovery of the fraud. His great age, the relationship of Pierce to him, both by family ties and as his trusted attorney and agent, and the condition of the parties, are all matters that should be considered by the jury in determining whether or not Lee exercised proper diligence. Appellant’s thirty-second assignment of error is: “That the verdict is not supported by the evidence, and the judgment does not dispose of the questions involved in this case, there being no judgment divesting title out of Lee to the lands which Pierce exchanged to Lee.” This assignment is too general to require us to review the evidence in order to determine whether or not it is sufficient to support the verdict. Defendants did not ask to have title to the land reinvested in the estate of Pierce; and although it might be proper to do so without such prayer for relief, it does not appear that any injury has been done to defendants by the failure so to do; but on the contrary, it does appear that Pierce sold the Hill County land to Tarlton, Jordan & Tarlton, and there is no evidence that he had title to the Harris County land, which he conveyed to Lee by a quitclaim deed. In their thirty-third assignment of error appellants embrace the entire motion for a new trial, covering about eight pages of a type-written record, and including all of the points previously raised. This is not a distinct specification of the errors separately presented under proper assignment, copied into the brief and accompanied by appropriate propositions and statements as required by the rules, and we must decline to consider it. Delivered October 14, 1892. No error having been properly called to our attention, for which the judgment of the court below ought to be reversed, it is affirmed. Affirmed.","A. H. Cooper, Administrator, v. John H. Lee. No. 3. 1. Fraud — Limitation.—When there is fraud growing out of a transaction wherein there was an exchange of deeds to land, the party defrauded has four years within which to sue for a rescission; or if the fraud was not immediately discovered he has four years from the time of the discovery of the fraud, provided that it must be discovered within a reasonable time. Following Cooper v. Lee, 75 Texas, 121. 2. Reasonable Time. — What is a reasonable time within which to discover the fraud, would vary according to circumstances attending and subsequent to the transaction, which in their nature tend to prevent a discovery of the fraud, and it would sometimes be a mixed question of law and fact. 3. Reasonable Time an Issue of Fact. — When L., an old man, resided with P., his son-in-law, who was also his attorney, legal adviser, and agent for the transaction of all his business, including the payment of taxes, and by the advice and at the request of P. executed deeds to him of his property, receiving in exchange deeds from P. to lands claimed to be owned by him, and L. relied on P.'s representations as to the deeds and the value of the lands, and by reason of their relationship put implicit confidence in him, and by his advice did not record the deeds so received, but returned them to P. for examination, and P. subsequently and without the knowledge of L. sold one of the tracts of land he had conveyed to L. to innocent third parties, and two years after the transaction, when requested, refused to return his deeds to L., the question of reasonable time within which to discover the fraud was properly submitted to the jury. 4. Reasonable Time. — We are not prepared to say that under the facts of this case fifteen months was not a reasonable time, and that the fraud should have been sooner discovered. 5. Rescission. — See the petition in this case for allegation of facts sufficient to authorize the rescission of a deed on the ground of fraud. 6. Evidence in FraudnCases. — The rule governing the admission of evidence jn fraud cases is liberal, and justly so. A deed made to innocent third parties by P. after he had previously conveyed the same land to L. by a deed which was never recorded, was properly admitted. 7. Assignments of Error Must Appear in Brief. — Under Rule 39 of the Supreme Court, assignments of error are required to be copied in the brief of the appellant, and each ground of error separately presented. This rule has recently been adopted by the Supreme Court as one of the rules for the Courts of Civil Appeals, and should be enforced whether invoked by the appellee or not. Being invoked in this case, and the errors assigned not being fundamental, twenty-three of the assignments of error are regarded as abandoned. 8. Error in Charge, How Corrected. — Complaint that the court failed to charge on the burden of proof, in this case, should have been corrected by appropriate instructions asked. 9. Discovery of Fraud — Proper Charge. — “If you believe that L. exercised ordinary diligence and care, and did not discover the fraud, if any was committed by P., prior to February 4.1883, or if, by the exercise of ordinary diligence, L. could not have learned of the fraud, if any was committed by P., prior to February 4,1883, then the cause of action is not barred by limitation. What is meant by ordinary diligence and care, is such diligence and care as men of ordinary prudence exercise with reference to their own1 property.” Held, not prejudicial to defendant. 10. Assignments of Error too General. — An assignment complaining that the judgment did not divest title out of L., when defendants did not ask to have the title divested, is, under the facts of this case, too general to require of the court the review of the whole evidence in order to determine whether it supported the verdict. 11. An Assignment of Error, embracing the whole motion for a new trial and eight pages of the record, and including all the points previously raised, will not be considered. Appeal from Harrison. Tried below before Hon. F. H. Prendergast, Special Judge. The opinion states the case. H. McKay and M. B. Geer, for appellant. The court erred in overruling the general demurrer of the appellant, and in declining to consider the question of reasonable time as a question of law alone and not of fact. Cooper v. Lee, 75 Texas, 114; Kennedy v. Baker, 59 Texas, 160; Bremond v. McLean, 45 Texas, 19; Watson v. Baker, 71 Texas, 739; Kuhlman v.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. Appellant Weaver brought this suit in the District Court of Cooke County against the city of Gainesville, for a breach of an alleged verbal contract with said city, and, failing to recover, has appealed from the judgment of the court below. The single question presented for our determination arises.upon the exclusion from the jury of certain testimony offered by appellant. On or about the 3rd day of May, 1887, appellant executed and delivered to the appellee a deed in the usual form, conveying a certain piece of land situated in said city of Gainesville, reciting a consideration of Si, cash in hand paid. This deed bears date May 3, 1887; was acknowledged on the 5th day of May, and recorded on the 19th day of May, 1887. It contained, after the part which conveyed and described the land, the following provision: 11 The aforesaid is deeded by me to the city of Gainesville forth e purpose of widening said West Hudson Street to Elm Creek, and the said property is to be used alone for said purpose. The city council, through its proper authority, to cause the removal and placing of my fixtures upon the proper line in accordance with this deed. ’ ’ Then follows the usual form, “ together with all the rights, members, hereditaments,” etc. The minutes of the proceedings of the city council of Gainesville contain the following entries: “April 19, 1887, on motion of Alderman Brooks the question of opening up Elm Street West, also the straightening up of Hudson Street, was referred to a special committee, consisting of Brooks and Howeth, with instructions to investigate a.nd report to the city council at its next regular meeting.” “May 3, said committee given further time.” “May 17, committee given further time.” “ May 17, the special committee to whom was referred the matter of straightening up West Hudson Street, reported that they had secured deeds from Curtis Blackwood and N. W. Weaver to a sufficient amount of land lying along said street to straighten the same. Report adopted and deed ordered recorded.” Appellant proved by W. L. Fletcher, her father, that on or about the 3rd day of May, 1887, being thereunto duly authorized by appellant, he went upon the ground in controversy with said Brooks and Howeth, and agreed with them that, in consideration that the city would fill up a certain objectionable ditch on said land, adjacent to other land of appellant, and put the streets in good condition, with the proper drainage, and remove appellant’s fence to her north boundary line, appellant would convey the land in controversy to the city; which agreement was fully assented to by Brooks and Howeth (according to the testimony of said Fletcher), and the terms of the same reported by him to appellant, who assented thereto and made the conveyance above described. Rome proof was also introduced by appellant of subsequent conversations with the mayor of said city and with the chairman of committee on street improvement, to the effect that said ditch would be filled up and the street put in proper condition. The proof of the verbal agreement was all excluded from the jury, because the deed introduced in evidence was the contract of the parties, and the above testimony sought to vary a written contract by parol testimony, and the court announced that he would not permit the introduction of any further testimony which sought to show that in addition to the considerations expressed in' the deed there was a contract by the city to fill and drain the ditch aforesaid, and to properly drain and grade the street, etc. The court signed the bill of exceptions, setting forth the above proceedings, with the explanation, “ That defendant’s counsel objected to the testimony of witnesses as to what Brooks and Howeth and other aldermen stated, as to how Mayor Rowland acted and what he said in reference to matters in controversy, because no one of them had the power lawfully to bind the city, and it was not shown that the city, in its corporate capacity, ever ratified either of their acts or their statements; and while this can have no effect upon the present appeal, because plaintiff did not conclude the introduction of his testimony, we invite the action of the court upon this point, in order to settle the question on another trial in case this case is reversed.” It appeared upon the trial that appellant owned valuable residence property adjacent to West Hudson Street, which was rendered unsaleable by the ditch and defective drainage sought to be obviated, and that the inducement to her to execute the deed was to have said ditch filled and the street improved, so as to render said vacant residence property sale-able. The line which separates the exceptions, real or apparent, from the rule which excludes oral testimony where a valid written instrument has been executed between the parties, is sometimes very difficult to trace. We find this case very near that line. It seems to be well settled, that “Where men have put into writing any portion of their terms of agreement, they can not alter by parol evidence that which they have written; and when the writing purports to be the whole of the agreement between the parties, it can neither be added to nor varied by parol evidence.” It is also laid down that the writing on its face should rebut the presumption that it is complete. It is, however, like other contracts, to be interpreted in the light of surrounding circumstances and the situation of the parties. In this case, if there had been nothing in the deed except the conveyance of the property for street purposes upon the nominal consideration of Si, the oral testimony should not have been excluded. We are of opinion, however, that inasmuch as the deed, after reciting this consideration and granting the land in the usual form, contained, in connection with limiting the extent and purpose of this conveyance, the stipulation that the city, through its proper authority, should perform certain acts for appellant, as set forth in the conclusions of fact, it purported on its face to contain the entire contract of the parties, even when read in the light of surrounding circumstances. While the widening of the street may have been of public benefit, it was also apparently beneficial to appellant; and as it was conveyed only for public use, we would not be warranted in presuming that any further or greater consideration was promised by the city than the expense of opening the street. There is no allegation that plaintiff was defrauded or that there was any mistake in the preparation or execution of the deed. Appellant simply declares upon the verbal contract, and claims damages for a breach thereof. In Railway v. Garrett, 52 Texas, 133, appellant set up a failure of consideration in a deed to the right of way, on the ground that the railroad company had failed to locate a depot on his land, as verbally agreed when the deed was made, alleging that that was the consideration and inducement for the making of the deed. The consideration recited in the deed was the sum of $1, in hand paid, and the further consideration that the company would locate its railroad over the lands of appellant. In the opinion in that case we find this language: “As this deed was executed by the plaintiff and accepted by the defendant, this recital is more than a mere receipt of the payment of the purchase money; it is also the written evidence of a contract between the parties that the plaintiff would grant the right of way and that the defendant would construct its road over the same. To permit a parol contemporaneous condition to be engrafted upon a deed in writing, it should be upon proper allegation of fraud, accident, or mistake, and upon clear and satisfactory evidence. ” We think this case is in point. See also Railway v. McKinney, 55 Texas, 176; Purinton v. Railway, 46 Ill., 297. Delivered November 1, 1892. Our conclusion is, that the judgment of the court below must be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered. Affirmed.","N. W. Weaver v. City of Gainesville. No. 18. 1. Parol Evidence — Written Contract. — Where a writing purports to be the whole of the agreement between the parties, it can neither be added to nor varied by parol evidence, unless on its face it should in some way rebut the presumption that it is complete. 2. Same — Deed—Consideration Part of Contract, when. — Where a deed to a city recited that the land was to be used only for widening a street, and that the city was to adjust the grantor's fencing to the new street line, this was held to evidence the contract between the parties, and parol evidence of a further consideration or agreement that the city was also to fill up a certain ditch was properly excluded. Appeal from Cooke. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Mathis & Lewis and Claude Weaver, for appellant. The court erred in excluding testimony offered to show that the city agreed to fill up the ditch. The suit is upon a contract of which the conveyance of the land is the performance on one side, and not the contract itself. The deed here is but an incident and part of a larger and more comprehensive transaction. The plaintiff’s contract is collateral to and independent of the deed; and parol evidence is admissible to vary the consideration expressed in a deed. Thomas v. Hammond, 47 Texas, 53; Taylor v. Merrill, 64 Texas, 494; Greenwood v. Pierce, 58 Texas, 131; Cox v. Bray, 28 Texas, 259; Railway v. Scott, 68 Texas, 694; Younger v. Welch, 22 Texas, 417; Wilkinson v. Scott, 17 Mass., 256; Preble v.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. The only question in this case is, whether or not the following evidence shows that the lot in question was exempt from forced sale as the homestead of a family; to-wit: “lam the plaintiff in this case. I am a single man,-years of age, and have never been married. I own the house and lot, the subject matter of this suit. I bought the lot something over three years ago for a home for my widowed mother, my sister, and myself. My mother is well advanced in years, and has no other homestead. Soon after I bought the lot, I built the house now on it, and when completed, my mother and sister, and also a younger brother, moved in the house, and they and myself have been living in it ever since as a home, and neither my mother nor I have any other home. I bought and paid for all the furniture in the house, except a few things in my mother’s room belonging to my mother. We occupied the house as our home at the date of the execution which was enjoined in this case, and now so occupy it. I support my mother out of my own earnings.” We believe that this evidence certainly describes a family within the ordinary meaning of this word, and we are also of opinion that it shows such a family as was intended by our Constitution and exemption statute. It is true, it is not stated in so many words that appellant’s mother had no other property, and was dependent upon him for a support, but we believe that this is the fair construction that should be placed upon the evidence. It is stated that his mother has no other home, and that he supports her out of his own earnings, and we believe it would be attributing to appellant qualities far above the average to co'nstrue this evidence as meaning that he is taking care of his mother out of his own earnings, although she has property from which she could support herself. We believe it would comport more with common experience to look for the son to use the mother’s property in supporting himself, rather than expect him to support an independent mother out of his own earnings. If his mother is dependent upon him for a support, it can hardly be contended that appellant would not be entitled to this exemption. Roco v. Green, 50 Texas, 483; Wolfe v. Buckley, 52 Texas, 641; Ramey v. Allison, 64 Texas, 697. In Wolf v. Buckley it was held that an old lady, taking care of dependent step-grandchildren, was entitled to the homestead exemption, although such children had no legal claim upon her. We have copied in the opinion all of the evidence in the case, which will be taken as our conclusions of fact. We are of opinion, that the court below erred in holding the property not exempt, and in dissolving the injunction; and as the trial was before the court without a jury, the judgment will be reversed, and will here be-rendered perpetuating the injunction as prayed for in appellant’s petition. Reversed and rendered. Delivered March 23, 1893. A motion for rehearing was overruled.","W. G. Barry v. V. W. Hale et al. No. 130. Homestead Exemption—Family of Single Man.—Where an unmarried man has a sister, and also a widowed mother whom he supports and who has no homestead of her own, residing with him upon his own place, this constitutes a family within the meaning of the Constitution and exemption statutes, and the1 property so occupied is not subject to forced sale. Appeal from Lamar. Tried below before 1-Ion. E. D. McClelland. Hodges & Pollard, for appellant. Plaintiff and his widowed mother and dependent sister constituted such a family as was intended to be protected by the exemption laws of this State. Webster’s Dictionary, title “Family,” defines a family to be “the collective body of persons who live in one house, and under one head or manager; a household, including parents, children and servants, and as the case may be, lodgers or boarders.” 1 Bouv. Law Die., title “ Family;” Const., art. 16, sec. 50; Rev. Stats., arts. 2335, 2336; Taylor v. Boulware, 17 Texas, 77; Wilson v. Cochran, 31 Texas, 680; Roco v. Green, 50 Texas, 490; Wolfe v. Buckley, 52 Texas, 648, 649; Thomp. on Home. Ex., secs. 55-62. Hale & Hale, for appellees. Plaintiff’s allegations, and the evidence thereunder, do not show that he was entitled to hold the property in controversy as a homestead, he being a single man. To entitle a single man to a homestead exemption, it is necessary for him to allege and prove that the persons who constitute the family are such persons as the law or morals require him to support and provide for, and in addition to that, he must allege and prove that such person or persons are dependent on him for maintenance and support—not simply that he supports them. This appellant has neither alleged nor proved. Roco v. Green, 50 Texas, 490; Whitehead v. Nickelson, 48 Texas, 528; Howard v. Marshall, 48 Texas, 475; Thomp. on Home. Ex., sec. 46; Sallee v.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. This is a suit by appellants as the heirs at law of Joseph Limerick and his wife Elizabeth Limerick, against appellee, to recover certain property described in an instrument set out in plaintiff’s petition, under which they allege the appellee claims title. They declare against this instrument, and say that it conveys no title to Eugene Bremond, the immediate vendor of appellee. Delivered October 19, 1892. A demurrer was addressed to the petition, which was sustained by the court, and judgment thereupon rendered, from which this appeal is prosecuted. The evident reason why the court sustained the demurrer was, that it regarded the instrument as a conveyance from Joseph Limerick and his wife to Bremond, and vested the property sued for in him. The sole question that we consider is whether the court erred in sustaining the demurrer. We do not think that the instrument is of that uncertain and indefinite character of trust that the courts will decline to give effect to. But we are in doubt as to the meaning and legal effect of the instrument as operative as a conveyance, or whether testamentary ""in character. It partakes of the nature of a purchase of the remainder after the life-estate has terminated, and has some of the elements of a conveyance of bargain and sale, and also some of its features suggest that its purpose was testamentary. In construing the instrument we are to look to the intention of its makers, and when it is possible such information should be gathered from the face of the instrument; but when the instrument is uncertain in meaning, and its language ambiguous or of doubtful construction, resort should be had to the surrounding facts and circumstances that tend to show the meaning and purpose of the makers in executing the instrument. Evidence for this purpose was admissible under the pleadings, and the meaning of the instrument being doubtful and uncertain, the court should have heard evidence of such facts and circumstances connected with its execution as would tend, not to contradict the terms of the instrument, but to explain its purpose and meaning, in order to arrive at the intent of the makers. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 27 Texas, 340; Rogers v. Kennard, 54 Texas, 33; Grimes v. Watkins, 59 Texas, 139; Hunt v. White, 24 Texas, 652. The court erred in sustaining the demurrer. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Justice Key, being disqualified, did not sit in this case. Motion for rehearing refused.","Patrick McHugh et al. v. Nicholas Gallagher. No. 376. 1. Trust. — See instrument not of that indefinite character that courts will not give it effect. 2. Construction of Instrument. — See document held to partake of the nature of a purchase of the remainder after a life-estate has terminated; having some of the elements of a conveyance of bargain and sale and some of the features suggesting that its purpose was testamentary. 3. Same — Intent to be followed.— In construing such instrument we are to look to the intent of its makers, and when possible such intent is to be gathered from its face. When the meaning is uncertain, as in this case, resort should be had to the circumstances of the transaction. Evidence for this purpose is admissible. 4. Same — Evidence should have been heard of the circumstances of its execution, not to contradict the terms of the instrument, but to explain its purpose and meaning, in order to arrive at the intent of the makers. 5. Practice on Demurrer. — In such ease the court should not on demurrer determine the intent of the makers. , Testimony should be heard. Appeal from Travis. Tried below before I-Ion. James II. Robertson. This is an agreed case. The appellants claimed as heirs of Joseph Limerick. The defendant claimed under an instrument executed by Limerick and wife, which was set up in the petition. A demurrer by the defendant was sustained. Plaintiffs declined to amend and judgment was rendered for the defendant; and plaintiffs appealed. The instrument which was passed upon by the trial court a,nd is discussed on appeal, is as follows: 11 The State of Texas, County of Travis. — This indenture made this the twenty-fourth day of February, A. D. 1887, by and between Joseph Limerick and his wife Elizabeth Limerick, of Austin, and State and county aforesaid, parties of the first part, and Eugene Bremond, of the city of Austin, State and county aforesaid, party of the second part, witnesseth: “Whereas the said parties of the first part, said Joseph Limerick and his wife Elizabeth Limerick, being fully impressed with the necessity of so husbanding the property earned and owned by them, so that they may derive a support therefrom in their old age, which can be best accomplished by their placing all their property in the hands of an active business man; and whereas said Eugene Bremond, the party of the second part, has been their adviser and friend for the past thirty-seven years. I ‘ Now this indenture witnesseth, that the said parties of the first part, in consideration of the sum of $10 to them in hand paid by the said party of the second part, and the further consideration of the care and oversight to be used in the management and control or sale or sales of said property by said party of the second part, do by these presents grant, sell, and convey to the party of the second part the following described real estate, situated in the county of Travis and State of Texas and city of Austin, to-wit: “ Lots numbers four (4), five (5), six (6), fifteen (15), sixteen (16), seventeen (17), eighteen (18), nineteen (19), twenty (20), twenty-one (21), twenty-five (25), twenty-six (26), twenty-seven (27), twenty-eight (28), thirty-three (33), thirty-four (34), thirty-five (35), thirty-six (36), thirty-seven (37), thirty-eight (38), thirty-nine (39), forty (40), forty-one (41), forty-two (42), forty-eight (48), forty-nine (49), fifty (50), and sixty (60), in outlot forty-one (41) of division “B;” also one and one-third (I,}) acre of southeast corner of said outlot forty-one (41) in division ‘B’ of said city of Austin, Texas; also lots numbers three (3) and four (4) in block one hundred and fourteen (114); lot number two (2), block number one hundred and forty (140), and lots numbers seven (7) and eight (8) in block number one hundred and forty-two (142) of said city of Austin, Texas. “These figures and designations being made according to the map of said city of Austin, now on file in the General Land Office of the State of Texas. “Also one tract of land in Tom Green County, known as survey 679, in the name of. C. Wetz, and abstract No. 4005, reference to which is hereby being made for a fuller description of said land; also 100 acres of land out of the J. A. Tanner league, in Lee County, Texas, conveyed to said Limerick by Mary. Wells on October 22, 1885, deed recorded in volume K, page 281, records of said Lee County, Texas; and all other real estate or property whatsoever situated, owned by said parties of the first part or either of them; in trust, however, for the following purposes: II First. All the rents and proceeds of sales arising [from] the renting or selling of any of said real estate herein conveyed (after payment of the taxes assessed thereon, insurance premiums, and expenses of management) shall be used by the said party of the second part for the support and maintainance of the said parties of the first part during their lives. On the death of either of said parties of the first part, then said receipts are to .be used for the support and maintainance of the survivor of the said parties of the first part. “ Upon the decease of the survivor of the said parties of the first part, then the said party of the second part, the said Eugene Bremond, is to make such disposition of the real and personal property of herein conveyed to him as then be in his possession as to him may seem best. “ In order to better secure the support and maintenance of the said parties of the first part, they, the said parties of the first part, do hereby authorize and empower the said Eugene Bremond, the said party of the second part, to grant, bargain, sell, and convey the said real estate and lands hereinbefore conveyed to him, or any part thereof, for such price and upon such terms as to him, the said Eugene Bremond, party of the second part, shall seem meet; to make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver in his own name deeds therefor, which said deeds shall be legal, good, and valid conveyances in fee simple of any land or lands by him, the said party of the second part, so sold.and conveyed; and the said party of the second part hereby accepts said trust. “Witness our hands, this the 24th day of February A. D. 1887. his “Joseph X Limerick. mark. 1 ‘ Elizabeth Limerick. “ Eugene Bremond. “Witnesses: John Nagle.” Walton, Hill & Walton, for appellants. The issues involve identically the same questions of law, and they will all be treated under this proposition : The instrument is a trust deed made for an express and specific purpose, placed on the trustors’ own property. The trust was executed without consuming the trust property, and there are no words in the instrument that passes the fee in the property to the trustee on the death of the trustors; nor is there named any person, thing, or use witli sufficient certainty for them or it to take under said instrument the surplus of the property after the execution of the express trust. The instrument consists of the following substantial parts: 1. Consideration $10. 2. Words of conveyance. 3. But the conveyance is in trust for a specific purpose, viz.: “In trust, however, for the following purposes: “ First. All the rents and proceeds of sale arising from the renting or selling of any of said real estate herein conveyed, after payment of the taxes assessed thereon, insurance premiums, and expenses of management, shall be used by the said party of the second part (Bremond). for the support and maintenance of the said parties of the first part (trustors) during their lives; on the death of either of said parties of the first part, then said receipts are to be used for the support and maintenance of the survivor of the said parties of the first part; upon the decease of the survivor of the said parties of the first part, then the said party of the second part, the said Eugene Bremond, is to make such disposition of the real and personal property of herein conveyed to him as there be in his possession, as to him may seem best.” 4. There is then appended as part of the instrument a full power of attorney from them to the trustee to act in the premises, in order, as they say, “ to better secure their support and maintenance.” 5. In the next year, 1888, Elizabeth Limerick died, and her husband soon followed her. 6. Bremond, the trustee, after the death of his trustors, gave away to the Catholic Church in Austin the property which is embraced in this suit. 7. The trustors had no children; appellants being of the collateral blood. 8. Those who claim to be the heirs of Joseph Limerick bring this suit, and were demurred out of court on the ground that the petition failed to show an interest in the property, because the fee had gone into Eugene Bremond on the making and delivery of writing herein before set out, and which is here subjected to construction by the court.

The instrument executed by Joseph Limerick and Elizabeth Limerick, on February 24, 1887, vested in Bremond the absolute title to the property therein described, burdened only with the express trust that its rents and proceeds should be applied by him to support Joseph Limerick and his wife during their lives, and Bremond’s deed to appellee, made after the death of the grantors, conveyed title. 1. The instrument to which this proposition applies is herein before set forth in full. 2. It recites that the grantors were “ fully impressed with the necessity of so husbanding the property earned and owned by them as that they might derive support therefrom in old age.” 3. It recites that Bremond had been 11 their adviser and friend for thirty-seven years.” 4. It recites the consideration of $10, and the “further consideration of care and oversight to be used in the management and control or sale or sales of said property ’ ’ by Bremond. 5. It describes the property to be conveyed, and declares that the grantors11 grant, sell, and convey ’ ’ the same to Bremond, 1 ‘ in trust, however,” for certain purposes. 6. The trust declared in the instrument was that the rents or proceeds of sale should be applied to support Limerick and wife and the survivor of them. 7. The instrument, after declaring the trust, proceeds: “Upon the decease of the said parties of the first part, then the said party of the second part, the said Eugene Bremond, is to make such disposition of the real and personal property herein conveyed to him as then be in his possession as to him may seem best.” 8. The instrument closes with this declaration: “ In order to better secure the support and maintenance of said parties of the first part, they, the said parties of the first part, do hereby authorize and empower the said Eugene Bremond, the party of the second part, to grant, bargain, sell, and convey the said real estate and lands herein before conveyed to him, or any part thereof, for such price and upon such terms as to him, the said Eugene Bremond, party of the second part, shall seem meet; to make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver in his own name deeds therefor, which deeds shall be legal, good, and valid conveyances in fee simple of any land or lands by him, the said party of the second part, so sold and conveyed; and the said party of the second part hereby accepts said trust.” 9. Bremond signed the deed with the Limericks. Rev. Stats., art. 551; 4 Kent’s Comm., 461; Bell County v. Alexander, 22 Texas, 357; Martin v. Parker, 26 Texas, 260; Ryan v.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This suit was instituted by W. H. Trent against Casey & Swasey, as attaching creditors of G-. W. Benton, and against John P. Cox, the officer who executed the attachment by seizing and selling the stock in trade of a small retail liquor store in Hill County. Trent’s title depended upon the validity of a transfer made to him by said Benton, through his manager, J. F. Etchison, made only a few days before the attachment was levied, December 28, 1888. Appellants attacked this conveyance for fraud. Trent had been clerking for Etchison or Benton for about thirteen months, as he testified, .before he made the purchase, and claimed that the consideration was wages due him for that period of time at the rate of B40 per month, and also some money loaned during that time and partly used in the business. He filed his suit on the first day of January, 1889, and in addition to the value of the goods converted, claimed damages for the conversion of the unexpired occupation tax license, which he claimed was also sold to him as a part of the saloon assets. Much stress is laid in the briefs of counsel on the point that the suit was filed on a legal holiday. This objection appellants seek to avail themselves of under a general demurrer and motion in arrest of judgment; but this, in our opinion, they can not do. Nothing short of a special exception, promptly made and urged, will reach such a defect. Williams & Co. v. Verne, 68 Texas, 414. The seventh, eighth, and ninth assignments of error relate to the exclusion of certain letters and other evidence tending to show, slightly though it may be, that the conveyance of the property in question was not made in entire good faith in consideration of a debt of unquestioned validity. These letters were written by appellee in the name of and for Etchison, as the manager of the saloon, to Casey & Swasey, in October, 1887, and March, 1888, and tended to show that the debt which appellee claims was then accruing, and afterward became the consideration for the transfer, was in fact not accruing, or, if accruing, that its existence was thereby attempted to be concealed from Casey & Swasey in order to obtain an extension and increase of credit. It seems clear to us that this testimony was admissible on the issue of fraud, and that these assignments are well taken. In transactions of this kind, where the failing debtor sells out to his hireling, and fraud is alleged, the fullest latitude of proof should be allowed. Every relevant circumstance of a feather’s weight should go to the jury for what it is worth. The sixth assignment complains of the admission in evidence of the bill of sale under which appellee deraigns title, for the purpose of showing thereby a transfer of the occupation tax license, on the ground that the statute provides for the transfer on the books of the officer who issued it. We are not prepared to say that appellants could insist that no right passed by the voluntary act of the parties without a compliance with the formalities prescribed by law. We are, however, of opinion that appellee was not entitled to recover of appellants the value of the license on account of the alleged conversion thereof by its seizure and sale under attachment. The law inhibits a second transfer. If, therefore, the title passed by the bill of sale, appellee was not deprived of his title by the sale under attachment. If no title passed by the bill of sale, appellee lost nothing by the seizure and sale of the license. Then, in the absence of allegation and proof of damages resulting specially from the seizure of the stock of goods and consequent interruption of the business, we are of opinion that the value of the license should not be submitted to the jury as the measure of damages for the alleged conversion thereof. Delivered December 20, 1892. The other assignments of error are not well taken. For the errors above indicated, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Reversed and remanded. Chief Justice Tarlton did not sit in this case.","John P. Cox et al. v. W. H. Trent. No. 731. 1. Pleadings — Legal Holiday.— Objection that the suit was filed on a legal holiday can be taken only by special exception, promptly made and urged. A general demurrer is not sufficient. 2. Evidence — Fraudulent Transfer. — When a failing debtor sells out to his own employe, and fraud is alleged, the fullest latitude of proof should be allowed other creditors in showing the fraud. Every relevant circumstance should go to the jury for what it is worth. ° 3. Transfer of Occupation Tax License. — It would seem that where an occupation tax license has been sold by the party to whom it was issued, a right therein may pass to the vendee, although the transfer may not have been entered, as provided by statute, on the books of the officer who issued it. 4. Same. — See opinion for case where special pleadings would be necessary to enable the vendee of such license to recover damages for being deprived of it by an attachment. Appeal from the County Court of Hill. Tried below before Hon. J, Gr. Abney. B. D. Tarlton, B. P. Hyers and W. C. Morrow, for appellants. 1. A civil suit, such as this, can not be filed on a legal holiday. The filing by the clerk and the endorsement by him is a necessary circumstance attending the commencement of the suit, and the petition in this suit (where no extraordinary process is prayed for), which shows by its file mark that it was instituted on a legal holiday, was subject to general exception. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., arts. 1182, 1184, 2835; Sayles’ Plead., art. 39; 1 Ct. App. C. C., secs. 874-878. 2. The said bill of sale and testimony of the witness Trent were inadmissible to prove the transfer of a retail liquor dealer’s license, unless it was shown that the transfer of same had been made on the books of the officer who issued it. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 4668; Dark v. Jamison, 55 Pa. St., 164. 3. The letter was admissible, as tending to contradict the witness Trent on a material issue in the case, as evidence of fraud, as charged in defendants’ pleading, and as an admission by plaintiff of a material fact relied on by defendants, viz., that Benton was not indebted to plaintiff for clerk hire.

The court did not err in overruling the general demurrer, because the fact of the petition being filed on a legal holiday could not be reached by general demurrer; and the demurrer must be considered waived, because not presented at first term of court when case was called, nor passed by agreement. Railway v. Harding, 63 Texas, 162; Sayles’ Plead., sec. 39, rule 25; Sayles’ Plead., 627. 2. The license had a value, and as between Trent and Benton the sale was concluded and the purchase price paid, and the effect of the statute cited would simply prevent Trent from pursuing the occupation until the transfer was made on the books. As to this, appellants can not complain. 3. The letters were subsequently admitted by the court for the purpose of tending to contradict Etchison. They were not admissible for any other purpose.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This is the second appeal in this case. The former appeal was taken by the appellee here, James Monks, and the judgment was reversed because the trial court refused to give a requested instruction submitting the issue of res adjudicata. Upon the last trial this charge was, in substance, given; and now the appellee in the former appeal, S. J. McGrady, seeks a reversal principally on the ground that it was given. A full statement of the issues of law and fact arising upon the former appeal may be found in 71 Texas, 134. We find in this record substantially the same pleadings and proof as are there reported. The answer of James Monks is precisely the same, and the amended petition of S. J. McGrady contained in this record seems to be, in substance, the same as his former pleading. The facts stated in said report we find to be, in substance, the same as disclosed by this record. Appellant’s first assignment of error reads as follows: “ The court erred in excluding from the jury the testimony of witnesses D. H. Scott and Richard B. Semple, which was offered to prove that in the trial of McRae v. McGrady the issue made by the cross-bill of McGrady v. Monks was not the same issue as is made in the present suit, because in doing so the court excluded from the jury the evidence upon which the said issue of res adjudicata should have been determined, as required by the decision of our Supreme Court in this cause.” In brief, the rejected testimony tended to show, that in the case of McRae v. McGrady the trial judge and the attorney for McGrady did not intend to try the issue as to the amount of damage sustained by McGrady on account of the alleged fraud and deceit in changing a clause of general warranty to that of special warranty; nor was any moneyed judgment sought against Monks, nor any reformation of said deed; but that the purpose in making him a party to said suit by said cross-action was to have him bound by any judgment that might be rendered in that suit depriving McGrady of the land, which judgment was expected to be used in the suit then about to be brought by McGrady for damages on account of the alleged fraud and deceit. We are of opinion that this testimony tended to vary and contradict the record, and to substitute the opinion and understanding of witnesses as to the meaning and effect of the pleadings and judgment in that ease for the legal construction thereof by the court trying this case. There are cases where oral evidence is admissible to show what was determined in the former suit, but this is clearly not one of that class. Roberts v. Johnson, 48 Texas, 133; 2 Whart. Ev., 157, note 1 at end of sec. 988; also end of sec. 785, vol. 1. We are further of the opinion that the testimony, if admitted, could not have changed the result. According to appellant’s own theory, said Monks was made a party to the original suit on the alleged ground that Monks was liable to McGrady on a covenant of general warranty which had been fraudulently changed to a special warranty, which liability was denied by said Monks, and this issue, at least, was tried and determined in the original suit. It could not be determined that he was liable as warrantor, and hence properly brought before the court to be bound by the judgment rendered therein, without proving the identical fraud and transaction alleged in this suit as the foundation for a recovery. The alleged wrong constitutes an essential part of the cause of action, whether the suit be upon the warranty or for damages for the deceit merely, and until that is established no damage could be recovered in either suit. It seems clear to us that appellant is not entitled to have a second trial of the same issue determined in the original suit, merely because in the subsequent suit he has a different purpose in view and seeks different relief. The point is made, that after filing his original answer, which contained the cross-petition, an amended original answer was filed, which must be held under the rules of pleading to take the place of the former pleading. It seems, however, whether properly so or not, that the issue was tried under the cross-action as set up in the original answer, and this must be held to be conclusive in a subsequent suit where the question arises collaterally. Delivered December 13, 1892. The questions raised by the other assignments have all been passed upon and decided correctly, as we think, by the Supreme Court on the former appeal. The judgment will therefore be affirmed. Affirmed.","S. J. McGrady v. James Monks. No. 52. 1. Parol Evidence — Res Adjudicata — Oral Proof Varying Written Pleadings. — Where under a plea of res adjudicata the pleadings and judgment in a former suit are averred and shown, parol evidence is not admissible which tends to vary and contradict the record, and to substitute the opinion and understanding of witnesses as to the meaning and effect of such former pleadings and judgment in the place and stead of a legal construction thereof by the court. 2. Res Adjudicata — Former Judgment Covering Essential Point. Where an issue determined in the original suit is involved in the subsequent suit, and is essential to any recovery therein, a party is not entitled to have this same issue tried again, merely because in the subsequent suit he has a different purpose in view and seeks a different relief. 3. Practice — Error not Subject to Collateral Attack. — Error of the court in trying an issue on the original answer, instead of on an amended original answer then on file, is not subject to collateral attack in a different suit. Appeal from Fannin. Tried below before Hon. E. D. McClellan. E. L. Agnew and Richard B. Semple, for appellant. 1. Where there are two judgments relative to the same object, and in which the parties are the same, though the former judgment is prima facie admissible to sustain the plea of res adjudicata, it is always open to a party against whom such judgment is offered, to show, by parol or otherwise, notwithstanding this apparent identity, that there is a difference in the points submitted in the two cases, and that the judgment in the former case does not cover a subject propounded in the latter. Cook v. Burnley, 45 Texas, 97; Philipowski v. Spencer, 63 Texas, 604; Whart. Ev., secs. 785, 988; 1 Herm. on Estop., secs. 211, 212, 2. In order to sustain a plea of res adjudicata in a court of record, not only must the evidence in the two cases be substantially the same, but the pleadings in the two cases must also present substantially the same issue and the former judgment must have been upon the merits. Hall v. Jackson, 3 Texas, 305; Russell v. Place, 94 U. S., 608; Frye v. Patch, 132 Mass., 109, 111. 3.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. Upon the trial below the court instructed the jury, “ that the sixty days within which to make demand by appellant for his damages would not begin to run against him until the message was delivered to him, or from the date when for the first time he learned, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence could have learned, that such message had been sent to him;” and the telegraph company complains in its ninth assignment at the giving of this charge. We believe this charge of the court was erroneous. We do not, however, think that this limitation must in all cases date from the sending of the message; but where knowledge of the sending of the message is received by the plaintiff long enough before the expiration of the sixty days after it was sent to enable him, with reasonable diligence, to make claim for damages as called for in the contract, he would be required to do so within that time; and where the evidence makes it doubtful as to whether or not such reasonable time remained after such message was forwarded to enable this to be done, the question should be submitted to the jury under appropriate instruction. In several cases where there was no conflict in the evidence, the courts of this State have held such stipulations in contracts of this kind to be reasonable, as a question of law (Telegraph Company v. Culberson, 79 Texas, 65; Lester v. Telegraph Company, 84 Texas, 313); but we do not understand any of these cases to hold, that where a part or all of the time called for in the contract has expired before the injured party acquires knowledge of the fact that the telegram had been sent him, that the jury would not be authorized to find such stipulation to be unreasonable as applied to the facts of that particular case. District Judge Spear, in a well reasoned opinion in the case of Johnson v. Western Union Telegraph Company, 33 Federal Reporter, 362, states the case of a plaintiff who is a farmer residing six miles in the country, and has business engagements important to him, but unimportant to his correspondent, in Omaha; he leaves his address at the telegraph office, and calls repeatedly for his telegram; is informed there is nothing for him; the telegraph company wires the Omaha firm that there is no such man as the plaintiff; they drop the matter; not receiving his telegram, he drops it; after the expiration of the time he discovers the injury done him; and under such circumstances holds, that this stipulation as to time in which the claim for damages should be presented would be unreasonable, and with this reasoning we concur. See Thomp. on Electricity, sec. 294. It has, however, been held by the St. Louis Court of Appeals, that where the whole time has not elapsed before knowledge is received, that it then becomes a question as to whether or not, under all the circumstances, sufficient time remains. Tliomp. on Law of Electricity, secs. 250, 255. This decision seems to us also to be sound. In a number of cases in this State it has been held, that the reasonableness of similar provisions in a contract of this kind with a common carrier for the shipment of live stock is a question for the decision of the jury under the circumstances of the particular case. Railway v. Childers, 1 Texas Civ. App., 302. Where the time in which the claim for damage is to be presented is fixed by the contract, the court might well decide it to be reasonable, as in the cases referred to above; but where the injured party has been deprived of a portion of the time he should have had under his contract in which to make his claim, and the evidence raises the question as to whether or not the time that remained was reasonably sufficient to enable him to present his claim within the time called for therein, we think the issue should be submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions, to decide whether the contract was reasonable as applied to the facts of that particular case. For this error in the charge, the judgment of the court below must be reversed as to the Western Union Telegraph Company; and we believe no useful purpose could be subserved by a discussion of the other errors assigned by it, as they are not of a nature that will likely arise upon another trial. The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Eailway Company complains, (1) that inasmuch as it received the telegram at Purcell, in the .Chickasaw Nation, to be transmitted to Ardmore in the same Nation, the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts for the United States for the Northern District of Texas, the Western District of Arkansas, and the District of Kansas, alone have jurisdiction of this case as to it. The act of Congress relied upon to sustain this contention is as follows: “ That the United States Circuit and District Courts for the Northern District of Texas, the Western District of Arkansas, and the District of Kansas, and such other courts as may be authorized by Congress, shall have, without reference to the amount in controversy, concurrent jurisdiction, over all controversies arising between said Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Eailway Company and the nations and tribes through whose territory said railway shall be constructed. Said courts shall have like jurisdiction, without reference to the amount in controversy, over all controversies arising between the inhabitants of said nations or tribes and said railway company; and the civil jurisdiction of said courts is hereby extended within the limits of said Indian Territory, without distinction as to citizenship of the parties, so far as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this act.” Without considering the validity of this act of Congress in any of its features, we are of opinion that there is nothing therein which seeks to give exclusive jurisdiction to any of said courts, or to deprive any other court of any jurisdiction which it would otherwise have. It only gives concurrent jurisdiction to the courts therein named. Appellant also contends, that the courts of this State have the right to refuse to entertain jurisdiction of cases of this kind, and that upon principles of sound policy they should exercise this right. To support this view, the case of Morris v. Railway, 78 Texas, 17, is strenuously relied upon. In that case it will be noted that both parties were nonresidents of this State. In this case the appellant is a Texas corporation, and we see no good reason why the courts of this State should refuse relief even to a nonresident against it in a meritorious case; but in this case it is by no means clear that appellee has lost his citizenship in this State. It is true, he is residing in the Indian Territory, but lie went from this State, and he does not seem to have become a member of any of the Indian tribes by marriage, as in the Morris case. In the Morris case, the court below refused to entertain jurisdiction, and our Supreme Court sustained it in such refusal. In this case the court below assumed jurisdiction, and we see no good reason to question the validity of its judgment on account thereof. Should a citizen of some other State or country seek to hold the Western Union Telegraph Company (it not being a Texas corporation) in our courts upon a cause of action of this kind arising outside of this State, the Morris case would go far toward holding that the proper course would be for our courts to refuse to entertain jurisdiction of such case. The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company presents the proposition, “ that unless the cause of action is recognized by the State or country where the wrongful act or omission occurred, no cause of action can be maintained thereon in this State, for in such case no cause of action exists;” and contends, that because the courts of the Chickasaw Nation can afford no redress in cases of this kind, appellee has no remedy anywhere.. Appellee’s right of action arose as well out of the contract made by said appellant to transmit and deliver said message, as it did out of the obligation incumbent upon it in the performance of its duties to the public, on receipt of the message, to transmit and deliver it with dispatch. We do not understand from the statement of facts that contracts of this kind are illegal in the Chickasaw Nation, in the sense of being prohibited by its laws; but the evidence only goes to the extent of showing that its courts have not been authorized to afford a remedy in such cases. If we should hold this contract illegal according to the laws of that Nation, we would, upon the same evidence, be required to hold all contracts made therein for the payment of money or the performance of obligations, except in a few specified cases, illegal. We believe that this has never been regarded as the law applicable to ordinary contracts made in that country, and we would not feel authorized in so holding, except upon the clearest convictions of its correctness. In 2 Kent’s Commentaries, 13 ed., 462, it is said: “Remedies upon contracts and their incidents are regulated and pursued according to the law of the place where the action is instituted, and the lex loci has no application. The lex loci acts upon the right; the lex fori on the remedy.” This we understand to be the generally accepted doctrine. If then it be conceded that the laws of the Chickasaw Nation have application to others than its citizens, can it be said that the mere failure of their courts to be authorized to afford a remedy in such cases will deprive the injured party, in case of violation of a contract made therein, of all remedy everywhere ? We believe not, and that in such cases the injured party can enforce his rights according to the remedies provided by the country where the defendant may be found. But if we treat this case as sounding purely in tort, we are not prepared to hold that the position of appellant is well taken, although the cases of Carter v. Goode, 50 Arkansas, 156, and Holland v. Park, 7 Tennessee (Peck), 151, would seem to go far in this direction. We believe the most that can be said from the record in this case is, that the laws of the Chickasaw Nation fail to authorize its courts to furnish a remedy in such cases, and do not go to the extent of making it lawful for persons to be guilty of negligence in the performance of a duty imposed upon them by law therein. In Willis v. Railway, 61 Texas, 433, it is said: “ The rules governing suits arising out of torts committed in a locality other than the government where the redress is sought are about these, as deduced from the authorities upon the subject: Where the action is transitory, and is based on personal injuries recognized as such by universal law, the suit may be brought wherever the aggressor is found, irrespective of the provisions of the local law, or whether there be any law at all in force at the place where the wrong was committed.” Citing Rorer on Interstate Law, 154, 155. Without approving this statement of the law to the extent of holding that a cause of action in such cases would exist irrespective of the provisions of the local law, if the local law changed what is termed the universal law and made the act complained of lawful in that jurisdiction, we believe the rule laid down to be sound in cases where there is a simple failure to provide a remedy, without making the act lawful. The courts of this State have held, that a plaintiff in cases of this kind has a right of action under what may be termed general or universal law, and that the measure of damages under such law is that administered in the court below; and we are of opinion, that inasmuch as it is not shown by the record that parties living in the Indian Territory are prohibited by the laws of that country from seeking relief, provided they can find the defendant in a jurisdiction which affords a remedy in such cases, and inasmuch as the appellant is a Texas corporation, and inasmuch as the contract with which it identified itself by receiving and undertaking to transmit and deliver the message was entered into by its connecting line in this State, we believe that our courts should not withhold redress for its violation. As we find no error in any of the assignments interposed by the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company, we are of opinion that the judgment against it for $1000 should be affirmed, provided appellee, within thirty days, shall file in this court a release of all claim against the Western Union Telegraph Company, and dismiss this suit as to it; otherwise, the judgment of the court below must be reversed and remanded as to both appellants on account of the error committed as to the telegraph company. We do not wish to be understood as approving the practice adopted by the jury in attempting to apportion the damage between the defendants, as was done in this case; but we believe the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company is in no position to complain of this, nor has it attempted to do so. Delivered March 9, 1893. A motion for rehearing was overruled; and appellee having filed a remittitur as to the Western Union Telegraph Company, in compliance with the opinion, the judgment as to it was reversed and case dismissed, and affirmed as to appellant the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company.","Western Union Telegraph Company and Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. G. L. Phillips. No. 109. 1. Telegraph Company—Stipulated Notice of Claim.—A message which was forwarded to plaintiff, but through negligence of the telegraph company never delivered, was written on a form containing a printed stipulation, that the.company will not be liable for damages in any case where the claim is not presented in writing within sixty days after sending the message.” Plaintiff did not learn of the message until about three weeks after it was sent. Held, that the court erred .in charging that plaintiff, for the purpose of giving the notice, was entitled to sixty days after he learned, or reasonably could have learned, that the message was sent. It should have been submitted to the jury to determine, under the facts of the case, whether the remaining time after plaintiff learned of the message was reasonably sufficient for him to have given the notice within the stipulated sixty days. 2. Jurisdiction of Federal Courts in the Indian Territory.—The Act of Congress of July 4,1884, which provides that certain Federal courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction over all controversies, irrespective of amount, between the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company and the Indian tribes and nations, and the inhabitants thereof, through whose territory said railway shall be constructed, does not deprive any other court of any jurisdiction it would have against such railway company, since the act'does not confer exclusive jurisdiction on the courts therein named. 3. Jurisdiction—Comity of States.—Where a Texas railway corporation, doing business also in the Indian Territory, is guilty of negligence there, the rules of sound policy do not require that the courts of Texas should decline to entertain jurisdiction of a suit brought for damages of a personal character resulting from such negligence, especially where it is not clear that plaintiff is not also a citizen of Texas. 4. Lex Loci—Rule not Applicable—Tort and Violation of Contract.—The laws of the Indian Territory, wherein the defendant corporation received for transmission the telegraph message which it negligently failed there to deliver, do not give jurisdiction to any of its courts over suits for damages in such cases; but they do not declare such contracts illegal, or render such act of negligence lawful. Held, that the failure to provide a remedy there will not deprive the injured party of all right and remedy elsewhere for the violation of the contract, or for damages for personal injuries, recognized as such by universal law, resulting from such negligence; and the defendant being a Texas corporation, and the contract with which it identified itself by receiving the message having been entered into by its connecting line in Texas, the courts of this State will not withhold redress for its violation. 5. Practice on Appeal—Separate Judgments Against Joint Defendants.—In an action for damages against two defendants jointly sued, there was a separate verdict against each defendant. There being reversible error in the record as to one of the defendants, but none as to the other, the appellee is permitted, on filing a release and dismissing suit as to the one defendant, to have an affirmance of the judgment as to the other; otherwise, the entire case must be reversed and remanded because of the error. Appeal from Cooke. Tried below before Hon. D. E. Barrett. Sometime in 1887 appellee, with his family, he being then a citizen and resident of the State of Texas, moved into the Indian Territory, and engaged in farming on a claim purchased from parties residing there. Early in June, 1888, appellee’s wife, who had consumption, went to her father’s house at Santo, in Palo Pinto County, Texas; and appellee, anticipating that she might grow worse, arranged with his father-in-law, J. C. Strickland, to telegraph him should this occur. On June 24, 1888, J. C. Strickland delivered to his son, J. H. Strickland, to be taken to the telegraph office and sent to appellee, the following telegram: “ Santo, Texas, June 24, 1888. ‘■'■To G. L. Phillips, Ardmore, I. T.: “ Your wife is much worse. Come at once. [Signed] “ J. C. Strickland.” This telegram was written on a piece of letter paper, and at the bottom thereof was written the words, “ Send in care of postmaster.” J. H. Strickland, at about 6:30 a. m. of the 24th of June, delivered this message to the agent of the Western Union Telegraph Company at Santo, and paid him the regular day charges, $1.50, for its transmission. The agent of said telegraph company, in the presence of said J. II. Strickland, transcribed the message upon one of the company’s blanks, and said Strickland read it over after it was so transcribed. At the head of the blank upon which the message was so transferred, among other stipulations, was printed the following: “ The company will not be liable for damages in any case where the claim is not presented in writing within sixty days after sending the message.” • The day on which the message was delivered to the telegraph company as aforesaid was Sunday, and its office hours at Santo on said day were-from 8 to 10 a. m. and from 4 to 6 p. m. The agent of the telegraph company at Santo started the message from that place at 6:25 p. m. of the1 day of its receipt, and it reached Kansas City at 6:44 p. m., over the line of said company. The message remained at Kansas City all night, and left there at 8:30 a. m., and reached Arkansas City, Kansas, at 8:34 a. m., and from there it was sent to Purcell over a line operated by theAtchinson, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, and from Purcell to Ardmore over the line of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company. It reached Purcell a few moments after it left Arkansas City. At the time the message left Santo, another message was also sent by the operator to the agent at the delivering station as follows: “ See mine of to-day and mail same at postoffice for delivery. [Signed] Stati;” which, was the name of the agent at Santo. The agent of the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway at Ardmore, upon receiving the message, made no effort to deliver it, either by mailing at-the postoffice or otherwise. There was no partnership or contract relation between the Western Union Telegraph Company and the Gulf, Colorado & Santa BA Railway Company, at the time this message was received by the former, for the transmission and delivery of such messages, and it was stipulated upon the blank to which the message was transferred as above set forth, as follows: “And this company is hereby made the agent of the sender, without liability, to forward any message over the lines of any other company when necessary to reach its destination.” When the message left the hands of the Western Union at Arkansas City, said company paid to the connecting line the charge for its transmission from said point to Ardmore. The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company received the message at Purcell to be transmitted to Ardmore, both of which places are in the Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory. It was shown upon the trial, that the Constitution and laws of the Chickasaw Nation did not authorize the bringing of suits in the courts of that Nation for the collection of debts or recovery of damages such as are claimed in this case; and the following statute of that Nation was introduced in evidence with others, to-wit: “An act approved October 17, 1876. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the Chickasaw Nation, that as there never has been any law for the collection of debts from the Nation or from individuals, it is hereby enacted, that no courts of this Nation shall allow any case of indebtedness to be entered upon the records of' said courts, except bonds and fines and such other indebtedness as provided by the laws of this Nation.’ ’ It was not shown that it was not legal to make contracts for the transmission of telegrams in the Nation, but it was shown that no action would lie in the courts of such Nation to recover damages for a breach of such contract. What remedies, if any, parties liad under the laws of that Nation for the breach of ordinary contracts, does not satisfactorily appear. Appellee’s wife died on June 27, and was buried the next day, but by reason of the failure to deliver the message aforesaid, he did not hear of this until about the 4th of July following, when he received a letter-notifying him thereof, and he immediately went to Santo, but did not learn that a telegram had been sent him for some ten days thereafter. Had he received the telegram either on the 25th or 26th of June, he could and would have reached his wife before her death. At the time the telegram was received at Ardmore by the operator, appellee lived some ten miles in the country, but he had arranged with the postmaster to send him the telegram immediately upon its receipt. Upon the trial in the court below the jury returned the following verdict: “ We, the jury, find for the plaintiff the sum of Si000 against the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company; also $500 against the Western Union Telegraph Company.” The verdict of the jury establishes that the Western Union Telegraph Company was guilty of negligence in not sending the message from Santo until 6:25 p. m. of the day on which it was received, and in holding the message all night at Kansas City; and it establishes that the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company was guilty of negligence in not delivering the message after it was received at Ardmore. It is not shown by the evidence whether the agent of the last named company would have made any effort to deliver the message had it been received on the preceding day, nor is it clear from the evidence that the message could have been gotten through to Ardmore on that day. The amount of the verdict is well supported by the evidence. The claim for damages was not presented by appellee until after the expiration of sixty days from the date of the message, but it was presented within sixty days after appellee learned that it had been sent. [This statement accompanied the opinion. ] A. H. Field, for appellant Western Union Telegraph Company. Plaintiff was not entitled to judgment, because his claim was not presented within sixty days from the time the message was sent, as required by the contract, and the court erred in its charge on this point.

Congress, by the act granting the right of way, having fully provided a system of courts for administering reliief between the inhabitants of the Territory and the railway company, it is manifestly against the sound policy of the government to have other courts entertain jurisdiction between the railway company and such inhabitants, which policy should be respected by the courts of this State.'

Unless the cause of action is recognized by the State or country where the wrongful act or omission occurred, no action can be maintained thereon in this State, for in such case no cause of action exists; and Texas can no more extend her common law into other countries, and thereby create causes of action, than she can extend her statutes into other countries and thereby create causes of action. Neither her common nor statutory law can properly operate beyond her own limits. Le Forest v. Toleman, 117 Mass., 109; Carter v. Good, 50 Ark., 156; Holland v. Park, Peck’s Tenn. Rep., 151; McLeod v.

Morris v. Railway, 78 Texas, 17. 2. A right of action exists under universal law to recover for an injury inflicted upon the person of another by gross negligence in doing or failing to do a thing that the law required to be carefully done; and the injury being personal, the party inflicting the same may be sued and the recovery had therefor in any jurisdiction where found; and especially is this true where the suit is brought in the jurisdiction of the defendant’s residence.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This case was decided by the court without a jury, upon an agreed statement of facts. According to this agreed statement, in July, 1886, Grimes County sold and conveyed to Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker her four leagues of school land, and thereafter said Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker conveyed the same to appellant. The Commissioners Court of Grimes County duly advertised said land for sale, and accepted the bid of the aforesaid parties at $2.45' per acre on twenty years time, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, payable annually in advance, beginning September 1, 1886; and at the July Term, 1886, of the Commissioners Court duly confirmed said sale. These lands were located as the school lands of said county in the-year 1852, and patented in the year 1877. The 160 acres tract of land in controversy is a part of the four leagues of school land. It was admitted that D. G. Ash was in possession of said 160 acres as an actual settler at the time said land was sold by Grimes County, it having been surveyed for him at the time of his settlement; and that he-was a married man and had no lands elsewhere, and had made improvements on said lands, consisting of a dug-out and cow lot; and that in December, 1886, he sold the land to appellee, having made a verbal contract for the sale thereof a few days prior to the sale of Grimes County, but no money was paid for his claim until December, 1886. It was admitted that appellee was a single man, without any other land, and that he had never lived on the land in controversy. The improvements were valued at $370. It was also admitted that Ash made a tender to Grimes County, and to Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker, in accordance with the terms upon which they purchased the lands, in the manner stated in the case of Baker v. Borroughs, ante, page .337, and that this tender was made as soon as Ash knew of the sale. It also appears that appellee deposited in court money and notes in accordance with the terms of the purchase from Grimes County, claiming the preference right secured by Ash and conveyed to him. The questions of law arising upon the state of facts indicated above seem to us to have been already passed upon by our Supreme Court. Article 7, section 6, of the Constitution, in reference to the sale of school lands of the counties, provides, that “Actual settlers residing on said land shall be protected in their prior right of purchasing the same to the extent of their settlement,” etc. The words “actual settlers” as here used have received a literal construction. Baker v. Millman, 77 Texas, 46. We conclude, therefore, in view of the agreed statement, that Ash was in possession as an actual settler at the time the land was sold by Grimes County; that he secured the preference right to purchase guaranteed by the Constitution; and as he and his assignee both took the proper steps to make this right available, appellant acquired title to the four leagues subject to this right. We are of opinion, that the mere fact that Ash had verbally agreed to transfer his right to appellee before the land was sold did not prevent him from being an “ actual settler.” As no further settlement or residence on the land was required, we are of opinion that when his prior right to purchase was secured by actual settlement, and a tender in compliance with the terms of purchase prescribed and accepted by Grimes County, he could lawfully assign all his right and interest to appellee, who would be entitled to assert this right without himself settling upon the land. That this provision of the Constitution applied to future settlers, as well as those who were residing on the land when it was adopted, has been expressly decided in the case of Baker v. Dunning, 77 Texas, 28. These conclusions dispose of all the propositions of appellant submitted under the first assignment of errors. The remaining assignment of error submits the proposition, that the order of the Commissioners Court approving the sale under which appellant claims is a judgment in rem, and therefore incapable of being impeached in a collateral proceeding. It seems to us that this proceeding of the Commissioners Court should be regarded rather as an act of agency in the sale of land than the exercise of a judicial function. It follows from these conclusions that the judgment must be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 7, 1893.","Cordella A. H. Baker v. John Millman. No. 92. 1. County School Lands—Actual Settler’s Right of Purchase.— The sale in bulk by a county of its school lands will be held subject to the prior rights of an actual settler thereon, who within a reasonable time after such sale tenders to the county and to its vendees, for the 160 acres he claims to purchase, the same price per acre, payable on the same terms, as in the sale made by the county; and the settler's right of purchase thus secured may be lawfully transferred to another. That the settler, prior to such sale by the county, had verbally agreed to make such transfer, no money having been paid thereon, does not prevent him from being an “ actual settler” within the meaning of the law, 2. Same—Occupancy not Required of the Actual Settler’s Vendee.—Where the prior right of purchase guaranteed to an actual settler on county school land has been duly fixed by tender, the settler’s subsequent vendee may assert such right without himself actually occupying the land. 3. Same — Future Settlers — Case Followed. — The provision of the Constitution (article 7. section 6) giving a prior right of purchase to actual settlers on county school lands, applies to future settlers as well as to those residing on the lands at the time the Constitution was adopted. Following Baker v. Dunning, 77 Texas, 2S. 4. Same — Judgment in Rem. — The order of the Commissioners Court approving a sale o.f county school lands is rather an act of agency in the sale of the land than the exercise of a judicial function, and is not binding as a judgment in rem against the prior right of an actual settler on the land.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. In 1884 John Durst instituted suit against John A. Chrystie, C. Anson Jones, Jacob Scherer, and W. W. Manning for the recovery of certain lands claimed by him under a grant alleged to have been made in 1810 by the Spanish Government. The defendant Manning made no appearance in the suit. The defendants Jones and Scherer, on the 13th of January, 1885, answered jointly, and filed a general demurrer and general denial; and answering further, they claimed to be the owners in fee of an undivided two-thirds of the lands sued for; and averred that plaintiff’s alleged grant was void and was a cloud upon their title, and prayed that said pretended grant be cancelled and held for naught, and that they be quieted in their title and possession, and for costs of suit and for general relief. On the 18th of July, 1885, defendant Chrystie answered by general demurrer and general denial. On December 29, 1835, appellant filed petition of intervention, asserting title to an undivided one-third of the lands in controversy; and answering plaintiff’s petition, demurred generally and specially thereto, and asserted a claim to one-third of the land by virtue of an alleged contract with defendant Chrystie for the location of certain certificates upon the public domain of the State of Texas, which locations were upon a portion of the lands claimed by plaintiff under his alleged grant. He denied that he had knowledge at the time of his location of plaintiff’s claim of title, and charged that the alleged grant did not cover all of the lands to which plaintiff was asserting title; and that his claim was greatly in excess of the grant; and he prayed for an order of survey, that the exact quantity of land included within the boundaries of the grant might be -determined. In the eighth paragraph of intervenor’s answer he sets out his claim of title and prays for relief, which paragraph is in these words: “ Defendant further denying that his codefendants own all of the lands> in question, respectfully represents, that he made the original location of said lands; that he is an attorney at law, and examined into the said pretended grant to Pedro Lara Posas and to Vincente Michelli, and that through his opinion and advice, and through the further fact of defendant having caused said supposed grant to be translated into English out of the Spanish language, which this defendant did and caused to be done shortly before the files were made on said lands, that it became known and understood by his codefendants that said lands were liable to location; and that at and before the making of such location this defendant had a contract with said John A. Chrystie, and those for whom and with whom he was acting; and that by reason thereof this defendant is entitled to be paid the reasonable value of his services in the premises, and that his co-defendants are liable and bound to pay the same; and that this defendant has never been paid anything whatever, and that his said services are reasonably and justly worth $10,000, or one undivided one-third of the land in controversy in case this defendant be paid in land; and that although the facts of the locating said lands were also well known to the other codefendants, they have never objected thereto, but have insisted thereon, and still claim two-thirds' of the lands aforesaid, and have so waived all matters of controversy, as defendant is informed and believes, between them and said Chrystie and those for whom and with whom said Chrystie is acting, and have accepted such location and adopted the files as made by this defendant; and that such location is a valuable one, and has been ratified by and accepted by all of his codefendants, together with the benefits arising therefrom; but that said codefendants have never set apart any share of said lands so located by this defendant to him as his part thereof, nor otherwise paid him for his services in the premises, and he here now prays that one-third thereof be set apart to him as the reasonable share of and interest in said lands to which he is justly entitled, or that he have judgment in money for the reasonable value of his said services, to-wit, the sum of $10,000. 1-Ie prays also for costs and full and general relief.” To this plea of intervention the defendants Jones & Scherer and Chrystie answered by general demurrer and general denial; and defendant Chrystie, answering specially, denied that he had ever made a contract with the intervenor by which he agreed to convey him any portion of the said lands or to pay him any sum of money as compensation for his services; and averred, that when said lands were located the said Branch was in defendant’s employment at a salary of $100 per month, with his expenses paid by defendant, and that said Branch was to receive no other compensation for his services, and that his salary and expenses have been fully paid. And the plaintiff likewise answered the intervenor’s petition by general demurrer and general denial. Upon this state of the pleadings all parties announced ready for trial on the 15th of July, 1891; and thereupon the defendants withdrew their answers, and the plaintiff took a nonsuit; and on ins motion, over the objection of the intervenor, the suit was dismissed, both as to the plaintiff and defendants and the intervenor. To this judgment the intervenor excepted and gave notice of appeal. It is a well settled rule of practice in this State, that one having an interest in the subject matter of litigation between other parties may intervene in such suit for the purpose of asserting and protecting his interest. Eccles v. Hill, 13 Texas, 65, and Graves v. Hall, 27 Texas, 149. If the appellant’s petition showed by its averments that he had an interest in the subject matter of litigation, and a cause of action against either the plaintiff or defendants, it was his privilege to prosecute his suit to final judgment, and it was error in the court to dismiss his suit. The State v. Loan and Trust Company, 81 Texas, 530. The question therefore presented for our decision is, Does the petition of intervention show that intervenor has an interest in the subject matter of litigation ? The law gives the surveyor who locates certificates for another no interest in the land located upon; and unless the petition shows a contract between the intervenor and the defendant Chrystie, by which the former was to have a portion of the land for his services, the intervenor has no interest in the subject matter of litigation. The petition discloses no such a contract. The petition in intervention was, in our judgment, bad on general demurrer; and our conclusion is, that there was no error in the judgment of the court in dismissing the intervenor’s suit and giving judgment against him for costs. The judgment of the lower court is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered March 23, 1893.","Wharton Branch v. C. Anson Jones et al. No. 78. 1. Intervenor—His Right to Resist a Dismissal of the Suit.—If appellant's petition as intervenor showed by its averments that he had an interest in the subject matter of litigation, and a cause of action against either the plaintiff or defendant, it was his privilege to prosecute his suit to final judgment, and it was error in the court to dismiss his suit. 2. Land Locator—His Interest in the Land.—The law gives the surveyor who locates certificates for another no interest in the land located upon. The petition discloses no contract between the intervenor and the defendant, by which the former was to have a portion of the land in controversy for his ser? vices; therefore the intervenor had no interest in the subject matter of the suit, and it was not error to allow the plaintiff to take a nonsuit, and the defendants to withdraw their answers, and to dismiss the suit.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. On the 24th day of February, 1890, appellant, who resided at Seguin, entered into a written contract with appellees, whose place of business was Bryan, by which he agreed to buy from them certain machinery, to be delivered on or about the 1st day of April, 1890, free on board cars at Seguin. The price agreed on was $3300, which appellant agreed to pay in two installments, on May 15 and December 1, 1890. It was stipulated that the title to the property should remain in appellees until the purchase money was paid, and that in default of payment, appellees should have the right to take the property and sell it for payment of the purchase money, expenses, etc. Appellant discovered that he had made a mistake as to the character of machine needed by him, and on February 26, 1890, telegraphed appellees. “ Hold order until I write; a change is desired.” On March 5, 1890, he wrote to appellees, indicating the desired change; and the latter replied on March 7, stating that the machinery had been ordered for appellant, but that the proposed changes would not affect them in any great degree, and requesting appellant to meet their agent, A. M. Rhodes, at San Antonio, on the next Monday night, when they were satisfied satisfactory arrangements could be made. Appellant did not go to San Antonio, but on March 11, Rhodes met him in Seguin, and an interview took place, about which there is a conflict of evidence, appellant claiming that the original contract was abandoned by agreement, and a new one substituted, and Rhodes testifjdng that no new agreement was reached, and that the order stood as first made. March 14, appellees wrote appellant, suggesting that part of the machinery specified in the order, and which appellees would have to purchase from other manufacturers, be changed, and articles of the same character manufactured by them be substituted, adding, “ Tour complete outfit with this exception has been ordered long since and will be shipped promptly.’ ’ March 15,1890, appellant wired appellees, “ Do not order any machinery for me now; I cancelled first order with consent of Rhodes.” Appellees replied by letter of date March 17, 1890, stating that they had received no second order, and had not allowed appellant to cancel the first, and that they had long since ordered the goods, and would have them shipped promptly, etc. Appellees caused the machinery to be shipped to appellant at Seguin, free on board the cars, most of it arriving by the 10th of April, 1890. The appellant refused to accept the machinery; and appellees, through their agent at Seguin, sold it, according to the terms of the original order, treating the property as that of appellant. The machinery was bought in by appellees for the sum of $1000, which was credited on the original order. This is an action by appellees, against appellant, to recover a judgment for the value of the machinery, less $1000, the amount for which it sold at public auction, after deducting attorney fees and costs of sale. The appellant answered by admitting the original order to have been given, but set up that said order liad been cancelled and an amended order given; and that the original order was repudiated on the 15th day of March, 1890, long before said machinery had been shipped him, and before some of it had been manufactured by the appellees or by their order; and that if appellees had any cause of action against him, it was a suit for damages on an alleged violation of contract, and not a suit for debt. The case was tried by the court without a jury, and the appellees recovered judgment against the appellant for the sum of §2815 and interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum; from which judgment the appellant appeals. It was shown during the trial, that appellees had some of the articles in stock at Bryan, but that the larger part of it was purchased from other manufacturers at various places, and that the orders for it had been forwarded long before the receipt by appellees of appellant’s message of March 15. There was no evidence, however, that the shipment of any of it had been commenced before that time, the bills of lading being all dated about the 1st of April. The telegram of March 15 was a distinct repudiation of the contract by appellant. The rules of law defining the rights of a seller against the purchaser, when the latter first breaks the contract by refusing to take goods when tendered at the time and place of delivery, do not apply. Tufts v. Lawrence, 77 Texas, 526; Gammage v. Alexander, 14 Texas, 419; 2 Suth. on Dam., 361. According to the rules laid down in these authorities, appellees should not have shipped the goods to Seguin, and thereby subjected appellant to increased damages, but should have stopped performance as far as they could reasonably do so, and then have held him liable for such damages as resulted to them. In Tufts v. Lawrence, 77 Texas, 526, a case similar to this, the measure of damages is said to be the “ difference between the contract price and the value of the goods in the condition they were in when he received the notice [of repudiation] at the place of their manufacture.” There it appeared that the property was to be delivered to the purchaser at the place of manufacture. Here the machinery was to be delivered at Seguin, and appellees would have had to incur the cost of shipment to that point before their right to the contract price could have arisen. The measure prescribed in the case referred to would therefore, if applied to this case, include a profit which appellees would not have realized had the contract been carried out. On the other hand, appellees may have become bound to other parties to pay for the larger part of the machinery before receiving notice of the repudiation of the contract. They could not be required to violate their contracts with others, but had the right to complete them and pay for the goods purchased. They might thus have been left with a large lot of machinery on hand, at different places, selected to fill this particular order, which they could not have disposed of without loss to themselves. This they should not be required to bear. The only effect of the repudiation by appellant of the contract was to impose upon them “ the duty to reasonably conduct their affairs so as to lessen the damages.” And appellant will be relieved from liability only to the extent that damages could thus have been avoided. 2 Suth., 361. The measure of damages must, we think, depend on the facts which, may be shown on another trial. In any event, appellees will be entitled to have the contract price taken as the standard by which to determine their loss. From this should be deducted the market value at Bryan of such of the goods as appellees had in stock there, and the cost of shipping-them to Seguin. There should be deducted such further sums as the machinery purchased by appellees cost them, unless it should appear that they could not have disposed of it for as much as they paid for it, in which event the amount they could reasonably have realized from it, had they not shipped it to Seguin, should be deducted; also the cost of shipping it to Seguin. The difference between the amount thus to be deducted and the contract price-is what appellees will be entitled to recover. What we have said is, of course, upon the assumption that there was not a rescission of the contract by consent, and that the rights of the parties are made to depend upon the repudiation of it by appellant, by his-telegram of March 15, 1890. The facts were not developed in the court below with reference to the measure of damages, as we define it, and we can not render a judgment which would probably reach the justice of the case, and it will therefore be reversed and remanded.

Revocation of Order for Machinery— Measure of Damages.— Appellant ordered machinery in February, to be delivered on April 1. March' 15 the order was revoked by wire, but meantime orders for the greater part of the machinery ordered in February had been placed by appellee with manufacturers. About April 1 the machinery was shipped by appellee, and appellant refusing to receive it upon its arrival, appellee caused it to be sold, and sued for the difference between the contract price and the sum received for the machinery when sold. Held: 1. The rules of law defining the rights of a seller against the purchaser, when the latter first breaks the contract by refusing to take the goods when tendered,, do not apply. 2. Appellee should not have shipped the goods to Seguin, and thereby subjected appellant to increased damages, but should have stopped performance as far as they reasonably could do so, and then have held him liable for resulting ■damage to them. 3. Appellees will be entitled to have the contract price taken as the standard by which to determine their loss, from which should be deducted the market value of such goods as they had in stock, and the cost of shipping them to Seguin ;• such further sums as the machinery purchased by appellees cost them, unless they could not dispose of it for as much as they paid for it, in which event the amount they could have reasonably realized from it had they not shipped it to Seguin, and also the cost of shipping to Seguin; and the balance will be the measure of their recovery. 2.

In an executory contract of sale, if the same be repudiated before delivery and acceptance, no title passes to the property, and the vendor can not maintain an action for the price or value of ‘the property, but must sue for damages for breach of contract.

When the appellees received the notice that the appellant had repudiated the executory contract of sale, and that he did not intend to accept the goods ordered, it was their duty to have stopped further performance of the contract and sued appellant for damages; and the measure of damages would have been the difference between the contract price and the value of the goods in the condition in which they were when such notice was received, or the difference between the contract price of the goods and their value at the time such notice was received.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Appellee was elected county attorney of Shelby County at the election of 1890. On the Monday following the election the Commissioners Court met, canvassed the returns, estimated the results, and declared that appellee had been duty elected as county attorney. The county judge issued to him a proper certificate of his election. The court being still in session, appellee appeared before it with his bond and asked that it be approved. The court informed him that November 29 following had been fixed as the day when the court would assemble and consider bonds of all county officers, including his. He asked the members of the court if they had any objections to his sureties, and was informed that they had none. He then inquired if they objected to the form of the bond, to which they replied that “ they had not got to that yet.” Appellee insisted that they act upon his bond, which they declined to do before November 29, unless the incumbent of the office consented. He declined to consent, and the court finalty refused to act upon the bond sooner than the time fixed. Appellee thereupon brought suit before the District Court, then in session, for a mandamus to compel the commissioners and county judge to convene and approve or disapprove his bond. After the notice to the county judge and commissioners, and a hearing, the court granted a peremptory mandamus, requiring them to assemble at a time fixed, as a court, and to approve or disapprove the bond. From this judgment they here prosecute their appeal. The first proposition in appellant’s brief asserts that the District Court had no jurisdiction to grant the writ. I. Because the amount in controversy was not sufficient. 2. Because the act sought to be enforced involved the exercise of judicial discretion committed by law to the county judge and Commissioners Court. The amount in controversy does not control the jurisdiction in this case. Besides, the County Court in Shelby County has no civil jurisdiction. The proposition that the calling together of the Commissioners Court and the acting upon'the bonds of officers involves the exercise of judicial power by the county judge and Commissioners Court, not subject to control by the District Court, does not raise a question of jurisdiction, but one as to proper exercise of power. Delivered October 11, 1892. We are not prepared to hold that the District Court would not have the power, in a proper case, to compel, by mandamus, the Commissioners Court to pass upon an official bond, which the law makes it their duty to approve or disapprove. And the question remains, were the facts presented in this case sufficient to warrant the exercise of this power ? While it was made by law the duty of the Commissioners Court to approve the bond of the county attorney, no time is fixed at or within which this shall be done. Eev. Stats., art. 248. We have not been able to find any provision fixing the time when the county attorney must qualify, and none is referred to in the briefs. The approval of the bond is required to be the act of the Commissioners Court. To act as a court, the commissioners must assemble from different parts of the county, at the place fixed by law for the holding of such court. They have many other duties to perform, and it is absolutely necessary that they be clothed with some discretion with regard to fixing the time for meeting and discharging them. So long as they are not shown to be abusing this discretion, by failing or refusing to do some act enjoined upon them by law, or by denying or withholding some right to which the law entitles a party, they should not be interfered with by mandamus. In this case, all that is shown against them is their refusal to act uponappellee’s bond at the same session at which they canvassed the election returns, with the statement that they would act upon it at another day, which they had fixed for the consideration of bonds of county officers. It does not appear that appellee was in any danger of losing his office by the delay; and while no reason is shown why the court might not have acted upon his bond when it was first presented, we can not say that any such apparent abuse of authority or exercise of unwarranted power on the part of the Commissioners Court is shown as to call for any explanation. The delay in getting possession of his office, to which appellee was forced to submit, must be treated as incident to the right of the court to set, within reasonable limits, the time when it will meet and perform its functions, when such time is not fixed by law. This decides the only questions in the case which are necessary to a disposition of it. The judgment will be reversed, and judgment rendered here in favor of appellants. Reversed and rendered.","J. M. Luckey et al. v. C. B. Short. No. 4. 1. Mandamus — Jurisdiction.—The amount in controversy does not control the jurisdiction of the District Court, in the matter of the grant of the writ of mandamus, and in a proper case it would have jurisdiction to compel the County Commissioners Court to approve or disapprove an official bond. 2. Mandamus to Compel Action on Official Bond. — Appellee was elected county attorney and received his certificate of election. At the same term of the Commissioners Court at which they had canvassed the returns, he presented his bond and demanded that it then be acted on, and was informed that the court had fixed the 29th of November, 1890, as the day for passing on all official bonds. Held, that no statute being shown fixing the time within which the county attorney should qualify, and it not appearing that the commissioners were abusing their discretion in thus fixing the time, they could not be compelled by mandamus to act on the bond at an earlier date. Appeal from Shelby. Tried below before Hon. Jas. I. Perkins. The opinion sufficiently states the case. Drury Field, for appellant. The District Court has no jurisdiction in any case unless the amount in controversy exceeds $500. Carroll v. Silk, 70 Texas, 23.

"KEY, Associate Justice. Appellees brought this suit in the form of trespass to try title, and described the premises sued for as follows: “ In Bell County, Texas, and out of the W. C. Sparks league of land: Beginning on east line of a 369 acres survey made for Mrs. Evetts out of the W. C. Sparks league, 587 varas south 19 west from the northeast corner of said Evetts survey, stake and pile of rocks for corner, from which mesquite marked X bears north 57{: west lj- varas and a mesquite hears south 51|- west 4-|- varas; thence south 19 west 2182 varas to stake in south line of W. C. Sparks league, from which elm marked X bears south 71 east 13-j- varas, an ash marked X bears south 35-j: east 5 varasf thence south 71 east 1716 varas to original southeast corner W. C. Sparks league; thence north 19 east 2182 varas-to stake and stone mound in east line of said survey; thence north 71 west 1716 varas to place of beginning, containing 675 acres of land.” Appellants, who were defendants in the court below, pleaded a general denial and not guilty. The record shows that it was mutually admitted in open court that appellees have title to the W. C. Sparks league along and down to the south line thereof, and that the appellants have title to the Joseph West survey and a portion of the Alexander McKenzie survey abutting on the Sparks league; that the Sparks league is the older survey; and the only matter in issue was the true position on the ground of the south boundary line of the W. C. Sparks league, and all the evidence related to this one issue. The court instructed the jury, in effect, that if appellants were in possession of or claiming any of the land north of the true south line of the Sparks league, to return a verdict for the plaintiffs; and if not, to find for defendants. The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiffs, upon which the court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs for the title and possession of the land sued for, describing it exactly as it is described in plaintiffs’ petition. This judgment directs that a writ of possession shall issue against the defendants. The defendants’ motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial being overruled, they have appealed. The fourth and eighth assignments of error are as follows: “4. The verdict of the jury is contrary to law. It decides nothing. It leaves the case just where it began, with the field notes in the Sparks title as the only guide to the officer who.may be charged with the duty of putting plaintiffs in possession of the land described in their petition and in the judgment.” “ 8. The judgment is contrary to law, in that it does not determine the position of the south boundary line of the W. C. Sparks league, which was the only matter in issue in the case, and the only matter to be determined by the verdict and judgment.” These assignments are well taken. Though nominally an action of trespass to try title, the agreement of the parties and the evidence made the case a boundary suit only. In such a case the verdict and judgment should definitely fix and establish the location of the line in dispute with reference to some known object then in existence, concerning the identity and locality of which there is no dispute. If the plaintiffs’ petition describes the particular land in'dispute and the line in controversy in this manner, then a general verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs under appropriate instructions will be sufficient. If it does not, then the charge ought to direct the jury to, and by their verdict they should, designate the line, or a corner from which it could be surveyed and fixed, by stating its course and distance from such established and undisputed object. Taking the description of the land as given in plaintiffs’ petition by itself, and there is not necessarily any uncertainty as to the boundaries. But the Sparks league was located in 1834. The ravages of time have caused the disappearance of many of the objects of identity called for in the original field notes; the bearing trees that fixed the locality of the southwest corner are gone; and applying these field notes or those in the petition to the ground now leaves room for dispute as to the correct location ■ of its south line. Hence this suit, the very purpose of which is to determine where said line is: and the judgment should definite^ fix its locality with reference to some object permanent in its nature, easily found, and now existing on the ground. Delivered October 19, 1892. When this is done the matter in issue is settled, and an officer can execute a writ of possession without having to try the question of boundary himself. But if the judgment follows the description in the petition, without any further identification of the south line of the Sparks league, it leaves room for the same uncertainty and dispute that existed before, and the officer executing the writ would have to determine as best he could where the south line of plaintiffs’ land is. In Jones v. Andrews, 72 Texas, 5, this identical question was considered and determined in accordance with the views we have expressed. The court gave the jury the correct rules of law that govern in determining questions of boundary. The seventh section of the charge is assigned as error; but, barring the failure to direct the jury to fix by .their verdict the line in dispute, we think the charge of the court is correct. The charge, of the court being correct and full on the subject to which appellants’ special charge related, there was no error in refusing to give it. For the error above indicated, the cause is reversed and remanded. jReversed and remanded.","William Reed et al v. Volney Cavett et al. No. 7. 1.

The verdict and judgment should decide, settle, and determine the very matter in dispute between the parties, and so describe the land adjudged to plaintiff by objects now on the ground as to enable the officer executing the judgment to put plaintiffs in possession without a judicial investigation on their part.

The verdict and judgment in this cause are for certain land carefully described and identified in plaintiffs’ petition and the judgment of the court. Two corners of land recovered were established by both natural and artificial objects upon the ground, and the evidence on the trial clearly pointed out the southern boundary claimed by plaintiffs, which was shown by the testimony of witnesses to be an old marked line and there is always a strong presumption indulged in favor of the force and validity of a verdict and judgment.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This is an appeal from a judgment for $15,000, recovered by appellee against appellant, in the District Court of Gregg County, for personal injuries' sustained by appellee while in the service of appellant in the capacity of brakeman. As no question arises on the pleadings except that appellant claims there was a variance between the allegation and the proof as to the manner in which appellee received his injury, it is unnecessary to state them, except so far as they relate to that question. The petition on this point alleged in substance, that while ascending a ladder on the side of one of the cars of a moving train, appellee was struck by a beam or piece of timber which projected too near the road for safety of employes, from a tank standing near the road, which was a part and appendage of the road. It was alleged that the tank was negligently constructed, and that it was an obstruction to the track, which rendered it unsafe and dangerous to employes whose business it was to be on the outside of the trains. The facts which we find to be established are: That a tank had formerly stood where the injury occurred, but had been blown down and disused for some time; that two or three weeks before appellee was injured workmen were put to repairing and rebuilding it; that in the process of repairing they had to erect temporary staging around it, which was somewhat nearer the track than was the tank; that the evidence does not show that either the tank or the main body of the scaffold was too near the track, but does establish the fact that a piece of timber projected from the scaffolding to within a few inches (not more than eight) of pass-, ing trains. This timber was put there by the employes working upon the tank, and was shown to have been there on the day before the appellee was hurt. It was not necessary for it to project out as it did from the scaffolding, and it was dangerous to brakemen whose duties required them to be on the outside of cars and to ascend ladders along their sides while trains were in motion. Appellee, at Mesquite, got off the train to uncouple a car which was to be left on the siding and recouple the engine to the train. When he had done this he was near the engine of a long train, which began to move off. Seeing that if he waited until the caboose, which was his station when he was not required to be outside the cars, reached him, that the train would be going too fast for him to mount it, he climbed upon a flat car which was passing him, and walked back along the tops of the cars towards the caboose. He reached a stock car, called an Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe car, which was taller than the others, and had no ladder at its end, but had one at its south side near the end. He got upon this ladder and began to ascend it, and as he approached the top he saw the timber projecting from the tank. He threw his head towards the car, but was struck by the timber and knocked to the ground. The evidence shows that brakemen are required to perform duties which necessitate their being on the outside of cars, and this act of appellant in mounting the train in motion and going back to the caboose along the tops of the cars was customary under such circumstances. Appellant had not seen the tank since the work of repairing began. He had been off the road for about ten days before he was hurt, and passed over it going west the day before for the first time after the rebuilding commenced. His position on the train was then such as to prevent him from seeing the tank, and he did not in fact see it. The tank was about one-half mile east of the siding at Mesquite. Prior to his injury appellee was making from $65 to $70 per month. His injuries were serious; his skull broken, his hip knocked in and crushed, his spine seriously impaired, his urinary organs seriously and permanently deranged. His strength has been so depleted that he has to walk with crutch or stick, and he can walk but a short distance without stopping to rest. From the time of his injuries up to this time he has undergone great suffering, both physical and mental. His sleep is but partial, and his rest at night very imperfect. He is now unfit for any kind of business, and has to take medicine all the time, and his condition does not improve thereby: He is. a constant sufferer of most acute pain. His digestion is so enfeebled and his appetite so impoverished that he is greatly reduced in flesh and strength, with greatly impaired disposition to sleep. His internal injuries are of such a character as to cause great pain, and medical skill and remedies are alike unavailing to give relief, and his doctor stated that his injuries will continue through life, and that in the meantime the appellee will undergo sufferings as heretofore, and that it is only a matter of very little time when death will result from them. Appellant’s first assignment of error complains of the refusal of a special charge, that if ‘ ‘ the timbers that struck plaintiff were the timbers of a temporary scaffolding, erected by the employes of defendant in order to build or repair the tank, and no part of the permanent structure injured plaintiff,” then the jury would find for the defendant, “because the negligence of the employes who constructed the temporary scaffolding was the negligence of those persons who were fellow servants with plaintiff, and he can not recover for their negligence.” The second assignment is, that the court erred in not granting a new trial, because the verdict is not supported by the evidence; in this, the evidence showed that it was a plank of a temporary scaffolding at the water tank that struck plaintiff, and no part of the water tank struck him. The proposition involved in the special charge is, that the mere fact that the timber which struck appellee was part of a temporary structure erected for the purpose of repairing the tank would defeat appellee’s action. Appellant owed duties to its employes, not only in the construction or repair of the tank, but also in the keeping of its track cleared of dangerous obstructions. Reasonable care was required of the company to see that this was done. It had the right to repair its tank, but this in nowise modified or conflicted with its duty with reference to the track. It was still its duty to discover, and within reasonable time remove, any obstruction of the track dangerous to the employes, however it may have come there, whether by the act of a servant, or by that of a stranger, or by accident. The charge requested required the jury to find for appellant, though the projecting timber which struck appellee may have been in nowise necessary to the work that was being done, and though it may have been left there so long before the injury that the company could with due care have discovered and had it removed. Whether the negligence of which the workmen were guilty in putting the timber so near the track was originally imputable to the company or not (as a failure to observe its duty to furnish to its servants a reasonably safe place at which to work), it is clear to our minds that it would be culpable negligence in the company to allow so dangerous a contrivance to remain in such position after it had discovered its presence, or ought by the exercise of proper care to have done so. There was evidence, as • above stated, which made it proper for the court to submit this question to the jury, and its refusal to give the special charge, the effect of which would have been to withdraw the issue from them, was correct. Appellant’s counsel in his argument contends that there is a difference between permanent structures along a railroad and such temporary ones as are put up in the process of repairing; and that negligence in the construction or position of the former would be that of the railway company, while negligence in the arrangement of the temporary structure would be that of the servant performing the work, and that none of his fellow servants injured by it could hold the master liable. In support of this he cites a passage in Bishop’s Non-Contract Law, as follows: ‘1 Where a railroad bridge was in process of repairs, and by reason of it a train stopped at an unusual place on the bridge, and a brakeman fell through it, the road was held not to be liable, and plainly in such a case the temporary imperfections incident to a repair are not within the general rule.” As we understand the proposition, it means no more than that a railway company must repair its track and is not guilty of negligence if there are imperfections in it which result necessarily from the process of repairing. The case referred to by Mr. Bishop is Koontz v. Railway, 65 Iowa, 224, and in that case it is said that the master must in making repairs exercise ordinary care, and it is held that the facts of that case did not show negligence on the part of the railway company. Armour v. Hahn, 111 United States, 318, also referred to by the appellant’s counsel, is a case in which one of several workmen engaged in building a house stepped upon a stick of timber projecting from an unfinished brick wall, fell, and was hurt. The timber had been left in that condition by fellow servants of the plaintiff and was placed as was usual in such cases. The gist of that decision is contained in one sentence of Justice Gray’s opinion: 6 6 The obligation of a master to provide reasonably safe places and structures for his servants to work upon does not impose upon him the duty, as toward them, of keeping a building which they are employed in erecting in a safe condition at every moment of their work, so far as the safety depends upon the due performance of that work by them and their fellows.” He further says: “If it (the timber') was at the time insecure, it was either by reason of the risk ordinarily incident to the state of things, in the unfinished condition of the building or else by reason of some negligence of a fellow servant.” The cases of Davis v. Railway, 28 American and English Railway Cases, 448, and Clark v. Railway, Id., 84, are clearly in conflict with decisions of our Supreme Court (Oram v. Railway, 49 Texas, 345; Bonner v. La None, 80 Texas, 119), and the doctrine of the latter case is condemned by standard elementary writers. Bish. Non-Con. Law, sec. 649; Beach on Con. Neg., sec. 134. The first case holds that a brakeman knocked from the ladder of a freight car while in motion by a tank too close to the track can not recover; and the latter holds that a servant struck by the timbers of a bridge too low to allow him to pass safely on the top of the cars has no remedy, because he assumed the risk. It is to be remarked, however, that the right to recover in such cases depends upon other facts besides the defective construction of the bridge or tank, as in the case of Railway v. Wallace, 76 Texas, 637. The other authorities referred to are all cases in which the injury resulted from negligence of fellow servants and from no failure of duty on the part of the master. Schaub v. Railway, 16 S. W. Rep., 92; Holden v. Railway, 129 Mass., 268. They are all clearly distinguishable from this case. Had the workmen engaged in repairing the tank done a negligent act which at once injured appellee without rendering the track unsafe, certainly appellee could not hold appellant liable therefor, because the negligence would have been that of a fellow servant. But when the negligent act of the servant consisted in rendering dangerous the track, which it was appellant’s duty to use ordinary care to keep clear of obstructions, it might be a question whether such negligence would not from the first be charged to the master. However that may be, a failure to discover and remove a dangerous object overhanging or projecting near to the track within reasonable time would be negligence on the part of the master, as well where such condition was the result of the acts of servants as if it resulted from any other cause. The facts showed that the timber was there on the day before the injury, when the same train passed going west, and reached so close to the engine that the engineer removed his screen to save it from ruin. In view of the well known fact that the railroad companies find it necessary to make frequent and oft-repeated inspections of their road, and the opportunities thus afforded for discovering such dangers as this was, we think that the question was properly left to the jury to determine whether or not this should have been discovered and removed by appellant before appellee was hurt. Appellant’s counsel insists that in repairing the tank appellant was bound only to provide against such mishaps as could be apprehended by use- of ordinary foresight, and that it could not have anticipated that appellee, at that point, would be ascending a ladder on the south side of a car as it passed the tank. The evidence showed that the brakemen had to be on top of the cars, and at times to ascend and descend the ladders while the cars were in motion, and that it was customary for them to do so when situated as was appellee. This made it obligatory upon appellant to know that a timber as close to the track as this would endanger the lives of its employes when thus engaged, and it is bound to accept the proximate consequences of its negligence in leaving it there. The injury to appellee was such a consequence. If appellant was not bound to foresee that this timber at this tank would hurt appellee, it was not bound to anticipate that such a timber at any other point of the road would hurt any other servant. Delivered October 18, 1892. The jury having found negligence, we think that the evidence is sufficient to warrant the finding. There is no material variance between the allegation and proof as to the manner in and means by which appellee was hurt. The third assignment is, that the evidence did not show that the tank was too near the track, and a new trial should therefore have been granted. The evidence did show that the beam was too close to the track, and that this was the cause of the injury. Appellant contends that appellee was guilty of contributo’ry negligence in climbing upon the car as he did, and in not having seen the timber at the tank. We think that the evidence sufficiently showed that appellee acted as was usual, and as brakemen were expected to act in such situations; and that he had no opportunity of learning the condition of the tank and the attachments before he was hurt. The fifth assignment is, that the damages awarded by the jury are excessive. While the amount is large, appellee’s injuries are extraordinary. His pitiable plight was stated in great detail by himself and his attending physician. No witnesses contradicted them, and their testimony establishes an extent of injury and severity of suffering rarely seen. We do ■not think the verdict so large as to require that we set it aside. No complaint is made of the charge of the court nor of the evidence, except in the points already considered; and no error in the judgment being made to appear, it is affirmed. Affirmed.","Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. John Hohn. No. 10. 1. Allegation and Proof — Variance.—The petition alleged, that while ascending a ladder on the side of one of the cars of a moving train, appellee (a brakeman) was struck by a piece of timber which projected too near the road for safety of employes, from a tank standing near the road; and the tank was alleged to be negligently constructed and an obstruction to the road. The proof showed that the beam which struck appellee and caused the injury projected from a temporary staging erected around the tank, which was being repaired, and that the scaffold was ""nearer to the track than the tank. Held, not a material variance. 2. Improper Charge.— It being shown that it was necessary in the discharge of his duties for a brakeman to ascend a ladder on the outside of a box car of a moving train, and the other facts being as indicated above, the following charge was properly refused: “ If the timbers that struck plaintiff were the timbers of a temporary scaffolding erected by the employes of defendant in order to build or repair the tank, and no part of the permanent structure injured plaintiff, then the jury should find for the defendant.” 3. Unobstructed Track. — It is the duty of the railway company to its employes to exercise reasonable care to keep its track clear of obstructions, and to discover and within reasonable time remove them when dangerous to employes, however they may have come there, whether by the act of a servant or a stranger. 4. Negligence of Company. — It would be culpable negligence to allow a beam of timber to project to within a few inches of passing trains after the company had discovered its presence, or by the use of proper care ought to have done so. 5. Repair of Track. — A railway company must repair its track, and is not guilty of negligence if there are imperfections in the track resulting necessarily from the process of repairing. 6. Negligence of Servants. — If the negligent act of the servant at once injures a fellow servant, he can not recover; but when the negligent act of the servant consisted in rendering dangerous the track, which it was the company’s duty to use ordinary care to keep free from obstructions, and it failed to discover and remove them within a reasonable time, then the negligence of the servant becomes that of the master; and it might be a question whether such negligence would not from the first be charged to the master. 7. Question for Jury. — The question whether or not the dangerous timber should have been discovered and removed by the appellant before appellee was hurt lyas properly left to the jury. 8. Foreseen Dangers. — It being the custom and duty of bralcemen to ascend ladders of cars while the train was in motion, the appellant was bound to foresee that a timber so close to passing trains would endanger the lives of its employes, and must accept the proximate consequences of its negligence in leaving it there. 9. Contributory Negligence. —The brakeman having been for several days off duty, and having no opportunity of learning the condition of the tank and attachments before he was hurt, and being in the discharge of his duty, was not guilty of contributory negligence in ascending the ladder near the tank. 10. Verdict not Excessive. — A verdict of $15,000 for a broken skull, crushed hip, injured spine, deranged urinal organs, and severe suffering physioal and mental, and such internal injuries as in the opinion of his physician must soon end in death, of a brakeman who had been earning §65 per month, held not excessive. Appeal from Gregg. Tried below before Hon. Felix J. McCord. The opinion states the case. F. A. Prendergast, for appellant. 1. The court erred in refusing special charge No. 1, asked by the defendant, to the effect that plaintiff could not recover if he was knocked from the car by the temporary staging placed around the water tank for the purpose of repairing it, because those erecting said staging were fellow servants with plaintiff, and he can not recover for their negligence.

All the other assignments of error may be discussed under two heads: (1) Was the defendant negligent in having the structures so near the track that a person climbing on the side of a box car of a passing train would be knocked off? (2) Was the plaintiff negligent in climbing on the side of a box car when the train was in motion away from a station ? Davis v. Railway, 28 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, 448; Clark v.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Action to recover damages for personal injuries, brought by the appellee in the District Court of Fort Bend County against the appellant. This is the second appeal; the first will be found reported in 70 Texas, 67. Plaintiff alleged, that he received the injuries on May 9,1885, while a passenger on defendant’s line of railroad going from Rosenberg to Alley-ton, at Randon, an intermediate station, where he had got off the cars on to the platform to deliver a message with which he was charged to some one there; that while he was attempting to get aboard of the train again, he was thrown down by reason of the negligence of defendant’s servants who were operating the train, in suddenly and violently starting the train without the usual signals; and his left foot and ankle were so crushed and broken that it became necessary to have his leg amputated below the knee. He also alleged, that prior to the injuries he was engaged in the business and occupation of a stockman, by which he earned the sum of 81500 annually; that in consequence' of his injuries he had been crippled for life, and wholly disabled from ever pursuing his occupation, which was the only business for which he<was qualified; that he was 46 years of age and in good health, and would probably live twenty-five years longer. Defendant demurred to so much of the petition as set up plaintiff’s 6i worldly condition ” and the probability of his life and his annual earnings; and also answered by a general denial and plea of contributory negligence. On the trial the demurrer was overruled by the court, and the case went to a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for 815,000, and judgment was rendered accordingly. Several assignments of error complain of the action of the court in overruling the demurrer, and in admitting evidence and charging the jury with reference to the expectancy of life and the earnings of plaintiff, because death had not ensued from the injury, nor had the earning capacity of the plaintiff been entirely destroyed. It is also contended, that there is error in the giving and refusal of charges with respect to the degvee of care exacted of the defendant towards the plaintiff; and that the-damages awarded are grossly excessive. We find the facts to be: 1. At night, on May 9, 1885, the plaintiff, J. C. Cooper, on his return from the town of Wharton, where he had been attending court, to his home near Alleyton, Colorado County, purchased a ticket from the defendant company at Rosenberg, on the line of defendant’s road, for passage over said railway from Rosenberg to Alleyton, going west, and entered the cars for the purpose of going to Alleyton. 2. Plaintiff had been charged by some one with a message to be delivered to Tom Jones, who was camped with his crowd of cow drivers at Randon, which was an intermediate station between Rosenberg and Alley-ton, about seven miles west of Rosenberg. When the train reached Ran-don it stopped in a position so as to leave the last two cars of the train alongside of the depot platform. Plaintiff was in the next to the last car, and as soon as the train stopped he got off the rear end of the car on the platform and stood near the car steps and called for Jones, and delivered the message for him to some one in the crowd who had answered-that Jones was asleep. Plaintiff turned to get back on the train, which was standing still, and just as he leaned forward and seized one of the iron rails put on the coach for the purpose of assisting passengers to board the train, with his right hand, and was in the act of seizing the other rail with his left hand, the train started without any warning, and plaintiff was thrown down under the train, and the wheels of the cars ran over his foot and ankle, crushing the same so that the foot had to be amputated below the knee. 3. Plaintiff testified, that the train was suddenly and violently started, thereby suddenly and violently jerking him down and under the train, about three or four fqet east from the west end of the platform, and between the train and the platform; and that no notice whatever was given that the train was about to start before it was started. Neither was the engine bell rung nor the whistle blown, nor did the conductor say “ all aboard.” If notice had been .given, plaintiff would have had a plenty of time to get back on the train in safety. Witnesses for the defendant testified, that the train was not started with a sudden jerk, because Miller couplings were used, and when they are used the train does not start with a jerk. They testified to their belief that notice of starting was given, but could not say so positively. We find that the train was started quickly and without warning. 4. At the time of the accident Randon was a flag station on the defendant’s line of railway. A flag station is a station at which the trains of the defendant are not stopped unless there is some one on the train who desires to get off at the station, or the train is flagged by some one at the station desiring to get on. It is not the custom to stop unless the train has been flagged, or there is some one aboard to be put off there. At the time of the accident there was at Eandon a depot, platform, and waiting room; also a section house, stock pens, and a water tank; but no agent or telegraph operator. The stop made on the night of the accident at Eandon was for water. The train had not been signalled for any one to get on, and there was no passenger to get off. Defendant’s employes who were operating the train did not know that plaintiff had gotten off. When the train drew near to the station the engine whistled. Plaintiff had often gotten off and on defendant’s train at Eandon, and never had to notify the conductor or signal the train. He always considered it a regular passenger station. 5. Plaintiff was taken to Eichmond for treatment on the morning of May 10, where he had skilled physicians and surgeons to attend him. His foot and ankle became so badly inflamed and irritated that on May 15 it became necessary to amputate his leg about half-way between the ankle and knee. He was confined to his bed about two months, and suffered greatly. His expense for board, medical treatment, nurses’ hire, and incidental expenses in getting cured, amounted to 81040. Plaintiff’s occupation was that of a stockman, and had been such from early boyhood. He was 46 years of age, and was strong and healthy, and was in good health at the time of the trial, and in a robust condition except as to his amputated leg. His expectation of life at the time of the accident, according to mortality tables, was twenty-three years. He had not pursued any other occupation than that of stockman, and his education was limited. He was expert in his business, and earned from 81500 to 82000 annually, besides attending to his own cattle and horses and other business about his place. Stockmen testified that a man as he was before the injury ought to earn from 8800 to 81000 a year, but that his capacity as a stockman had been destroyed. By reason of the injury plaintiff’s earning capacity was shown to be practically destroyed. He could not do anything in the line of stockman or boss cow driver, because he could not get about, and mount his horse and ride as before. He testified that he could not plow nor hoe, nor perform any other labor he thought himself capable of doing; that since the injury he had not been able to perform any kind of labor, nor had he made any money since the accident. 1. There was no error in overruling defendant’s demurrer to the petition. Plaintiff’s capacity to pursue his accustomed employment was at least permanently impaired, if not permanently destroyed; and in order to show the damage that he has sustained, and the extent of the injury, it was proper to show that he was engaged in a particular business, and the loss from the incapacity to pursue that business. The loss is the difference between what the annual earnings were before the injury and what they would be, if any, with the diminished capacity; and when it has been shown that the injury is permanent, as was done in the case of the plaintiff, it is proper to show what the expectation of life is, so as to enable the jury to form an estimate as nearly as possible of what the damage or loss may be. Hence there could be no error in admitting evidence to show what the plaintiff’s occupation or business was, and what his annual, earnings from his occupation had been prior to the injury. Wade v. Leroy, 20 How., 34; Luck v. Ripon, 52 Wis., 196; Nebraska City v. Campbell, 2 Black, 590; 3 Suth. on Dam., 261-265, 716-723; Indianapolis v. Gaston, 58 Ind., 224; Welch v. Ware, 32 Mich., 77; George v. Haverhill, 110 Mass., 506; Elkhart v. Ritter, 66 Ind., 136; Railway v. Putnam, 118 U. S., 554. In the last named case the court said: “ In an action for a personal injury, the plaintiff is entitled to recover compensation, so far as it is susceptible of an estimate in money, for the loss and damage caused to him by the defendant’s negligence, including not only expenses incurred for medical attendance, and a reasonable sum for his pain and suffering, but also a fair recompense for the loss of what he would otherwise have earned in his trade or profession, and has been deprived of the capacity of earning by the wrongful act of the defendant.” We are of the opinion that in order to show the extent of plaintiff’s injuries, it was proper to show in connection with the evidence that the injury was of a permanent character, and what his annual earnings had been, and what the probable duration of plaintiff’s life was. It is impossible for a jury to determine with any degree of exactness what damage has been sustained in cases of personal injuries, and it must be approximated by the aid of such evidence as will tend to show what it is; and having first ascertained how much the capacity for earning money has been diminished by an annual estimate, it would then become a proper subject of inquiry, how long the plaintiff would likely live. The testimony of the actuary, that a healthy man forty-six years old would probably live twenty-three and four one-hundredths years, was admissible. We are aware that it was held in Railway v. Douglass, 69 Texas, 694, that the rule seemed to be that when death results from the injury, or when the evidence tends to show that the earning capacity is entirely destroyed, the testimony is admissible, otherwise not. In support of this proposition the court cited, Pierce on Railroads, 297; Wilson v. Railway, 38 Iowa, 364; McDonald v. Railway, 26 Iowa, 139. Mr. Pierce states the proposition broadly, that “in actions for injuries not resulting in death, life tables are not competent evidence of the probable injury;” but he is not sustained by any authority to which we have had access. The case in 26 Iowa, supra, is where there were injuries to the wife, “ permanent in their nature, and likely to disable her during her life from rendering effectual service to her husband and family in the discharge of her household duties; and that in consequence a woman had been and was, and probably would have to be, employed to do the work she had been accustomed to perform.” Held, that under the circumstances there was no error in the admission of the Carlisle tables to show the expectancy of the life of the wife. In Railway v. Putnam, supra, standard life and annuity tables, showing at any age the probable duration of life, and the present value of a life annuity, were held to be competent evidence in order to assist the jury in making an estimate of a fair recompense to the plaintiff “ for the loss of what he would otherwise have earned in his trade or profession.” The injuries to the plaintiff in that case were, “his collar bone, shoulder-blade, and several ribs were broken, and his sight, hearing, ease of breathing, and his capacity to do business impaired.” He was an adjuster by profession, and his capacity to do business was impaired because he could not travel around as he formerly could, and was compelled to remain in an office, where he earned much less. Notwithstanding the case of Railway v. Douglass, supra, we are constrained to hold that under the circumstances the evidence was admissible. See rule intimated by Judge Bonner in Railway v. Willie, 53 Texas, 328; also City of Lincoln v. Smith, 45 N. W. Rep., 44. From what has been said it also follows, that we do not think there was any error as complained under the twelfth and fourteenth assignments of error. The twelfth assignment is, that the court erred in its charge on the measure of damages in submitting the “loss of future earning power,” and ‘ ‘ should have qualified the language so as to submit the question as one of total loss of earning power.” The fourteenth assignment is based on the following paragraph of the charge: “ The evidence adduced touching the age, probable expectancy of life, and earnings of the plaintiff may be considered by the jury, if they find for the plaintiff, along with all the other evidence, in arriving at what loss, if any, plaintiff has sustained from diminished earnings since the injury and loss of earning power; but the jury will not understand from this that they can from such facts fix a basis of computation without regard to plaintiff’s capacity, if any, to earn money since the injuries and in the future; nor are such facts, if proved, to be considered otherwise than as circumstances to be weighed by the jury, with all the other evidence, in arriving at a fair and just pecuniary compensation for the loss to plaintiff, if any, resulting directly from the injuries received.” It appears from the paragraph of the charge above quoted that the effect of the evidence touching the plaintiff’s age and probable expectancy of life was properly limited. Railway v. Putnam, 118 U. S., 554. 2. The refusal of the following requested instruction by the court has been assigned as error: “ The contract of a railway company as a carrier is to carry a passenger to his point of destination, and not to afford him opportunities to leave the car at intermediate stations, except at stopping places for refreshments; and if a passenger alights at such intermediate stations or stopping places, unless the servants of the carrier actually know the fact, or unless the servants of the carrier are ignorant through negligence, they are not bound to more than their usual care and watchfulness in starting the trains from such stations or stopping places. And if you believe from the evidence that plaintiff, Cooper, got off the train, at night at Eandon, an intermediate station or stopping place, and not the place he was bound for; that the train stopped there for water only; that it was not a regular passenger station; that the train men knew that no other passenger was to get on or off there at that time, and that was a fact; that the train men did not know that Cooper had gotten off there, and their ignorance was not through negligence on their part, and that they started the train from Eandon in the usual careful way, without any negligence on their part, you will find for defendant.” Some authorities hold, that the relation of carrier and passenger continues until the journey has been concluded, and that the passenger is entitled to protection while he is temporarily absent from the cars at a way station for a proper purpose. Packet Co. v. True, 88 Ill., 608; Railway v. Riley, 39 Ind., 568; Mitchell v. Railway, 30 Ga., 27. The exception that the passenger may alight for refreshments is well established; but we do not see, when the train stops at a station, why a passenger may not alight, using proper care, for a proper purpose, as speaking to some one on the platform, as in this case. This would be a reasonable implication from the contract of carriage. Again, it has been held, that when a train stops at a passenger depot there is an implied invitation to alight, and in starting the train again every reasonable precaution should be taken to prevent injury to any passenger who should alight, whilst getting off or back on the train, such as giving warning of the starting of the train by customary signals. We do not think that the evidence here presents a case coming within the decisions holding that when the train stops elsewhere than at a station, as at a water tank or upon a side track, when the stop is made for the purposes of the railroad alone, and the passenger leaves the cars, he acts at his peril, and that his own negligence will prevent a recovery. It may be true that Eandon was only a flag station, but it was a station for passengers to get on and off, and there was a depot and platform there, and the undisclosed purpose of the train men to stop there for water alone-could not change the character of the station; and if the plaintiff exercised care in attempting to get aboard the train after he had alighted, he was guilty of no a'ct of negligence that would prevent a recovery for injuries caused by the negligence of the defendant’s servants in starting the train. These views we do not think are in conflict with Railway v. Foreman, 73 Texas, 314. Plaintiff was certainly entitled to have the degree of care exercised towards him, as enunciated in the charge of the court, as follows: “In this case the duty of defendant toward the plaintiff was to use such care to avoid injuring him as an ordinarily prudent and skillful person engaged in its business would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances; failing in which to plaintiff’s injury, it would be guilty of negligence, otherwise not. If the jury believe from the evidence that defendant’s employes observed such care and skill in starting the train as an ordinarily prudent person in like business would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances, or if the jury believe that the injuries complained of were not the natural and probable consequences of starting the train as done, nor such consequence as defendant’s employes in charge might reasonably have anticipated as likely to flow from such starting of the train, then return a verdict for defendant.” This charge did not impose any greater degree of- duty upon the defendant than the exercise of ordinary care, which is finally the degree of care imposed by the requested instruction. So there could be no error in refusing to give the instruction informing the jury as to the nature of the contract and the effect of a stoppage at an intermediate station, because the instruction admits the obligation of defendant to the same degree of care as contained in the charge of the court, and the case at least, depends on the fact as to whether or not defendant’s servants used due care in starting the train. 3. As it was shown by the evidence that Eandon was a passenger depot, although a flag station, the refusal of the charge requested, that “a higher degree of care is required of train men at a passenger depot than at stopping places for water only,” was not error; and it was immaterial, so far as the facts of this case are concerned, whether the train was stopped for water only or to take on or put off passengers, and no instruction was. called for making any such distinction. , 4. Appellant’s ninth assignment shows no error. It is as follows: “The court erred in refusing to give the following charge asked by defendant, viz.: ‘ It is not negligence in itself to start a train from a passenger depot without ringing a bell, or blowing a whistle, or saying 6 (all aboard.” The question of negligence must be determined from a consideration of all the facts in evidence in the case, and not simply by the question of whether or not the bell was rung, or the whistle blown, or “ all aboard” called out by the conductor.’ And in giving the above with the following qualification attached to it, to-wit: 6 The law does not undertake to declare what act or omission amounts to negligence, but it is for a jury to say, from a consideration of all the evidence, whether a given act or omission amounts to negligence, under the law’s definition and explanation of negligence as is given in the court’s charge.’ The qualification having the effect of allowing the jury to consider the omission to ring the bell, etc., to be of itself negligence, and of destroying the meaning of the charge requested.” The requested charge was given with the qualification. 5. The fifteenth assignment of error, that “the court should have granted a new trial, because the verdict of the jury is contrary to the preponderance of the evidence upon every issue submitted to the court, and to the law as applied to the issues by the court,” is too general, and not in compliance with the rules. 6. While the verdict is a large one, we do not feel authorized to reverse the judgment on that account. Plaintiff paid out a large sum of money for board, medical attendance, and nurses; he suffered a great deal; was confined to his bed about two months; and the evidence shows that his business has been broken up, and that his capacity for earning money has been almost totally impaired. We do not think the charge subject to the criticism made in the tenth assignment of error; and the complaint in the fifth assignment is not sustained by the record. Although evidence as to value of an annuity would have been admissible, the witness Houston did not testify as to what the value was. . There being no error in the record, the judgment of the court below will be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 12, 1893.","Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Company v. J. C. Cooper. No. 99. 1. Damages — Impaired Capacity for Pursuing Occupation.— Plaintiff alleged that prior to his injuries he earned $1500 per year, and by his injury was made a cripple for life, and incapacitated from ever pursuing his occupation of stockman, which' was the only business for which he was qualified; that he was forty-six years old, in good health, and would probably live twenty-five years longer. Demurrer to these allegations was properly overruled. It was proper to show that he was engaged in a particular business, and the loss from incapacity to pursue it. 2. Same—Measure of Damages.—The loss is the difference between what the annual earnings were before the injury, and what they would be, if any, with the diminished capacity; and when it has been shown that the injury is permanent, as was done in this case, it is proper to show what the expectation of life is, to enable the jury to form an estimate as nearly as possible of what the damage or loss may be. 3. Evidence of Duration of Life.—The testimony of the actuary, that a healthy man forty-six years old would probably live twenty-three and four oneliundredths years, was admissible. It was held in Railway v. Douglass, 69 Texas, •094, that the rule seemed to be that when death resulted from an injury, or when the evidence tends to show that the earning capacity is entirely destroyed, the testimony is admissible, otherwise not; but we are constrained to hold that under the •circumstances of this case the evidence was admissible. 4. Case not Adhered to.—Railway v. Douglass, 69 Texas, 694, on the question of the admissibility of evidence of probable duration of life, in a case of permanent injury, not followed. 5. Limiting Effect of Such Evidence.—The following charge properly limits the effect of evidence touching plaintiff’s age and expectancy of life: “ The evidence adduced touching the age, probable expectancy of life, and earnings of the plaintiff, may be considered by the jury, if they find for the plaintiff, along with all the other evidence, in arriving at what loss, if any, plaintiff has sustained from diminished earnings since the injury, and loss of earning power; but the jury will not understand from this that they can from such facts fix a basis of computation without regard to plaintiff's capacity, if any, to earn money since the injuries and in the future; nor are such facts,-if proved, to be considered otherwise than as circumstances to be weighed by the jury with all the other evidence, in arriving at a fair and just pecuniary compensation for the loss to plaintiff, if any, resulting directly from the injuries sustained.” 6. Alighting at a Flag Station.—Though the train stopped at Bandon only for water, and it was onlya flag station, but there was a depot and platform there, and the undisclosed purpose of the train men to get water there, could not change the character of the station, and the evidence does not present a ease coming within the decisions holding that when a train stops at a water tank or elsewhere than at a station, and the passenger leaves the train, he acts at his own peril, and his own negligence will prevent a recovery. If plaintiff exercised care in attempting to get aboard the train, after he had alighted, he was guilty of no act of negligence which would prevent a recovery for injuries caused by defendant's servants in starting the train without notice. 7. Ordinary Care.—See charge held not to impose any greater degree of duty upon the defendant than the exercise of ordinary care. 8. Degree of Care at Station.—Bandon being a passenger station although a flag station, it was not error to refuse a charge “ that a higher degree of care is required of train men at a passenger depot than at a stopping place for water only.” So far as this case is concerned, it is immaterial whether the train stopped for water or to put off or take on passengers. 9. Negligence, How Determined. — It was not error for the court to qualify a charge asked, wherein specific acts named were declared not to be negligence in themselves, by the following addition: “ The law does not undertake to declare what act or omission amounts to negligence, but it is for the jury to say from all the evidence whether a given act or omission amounts to negligence.” 10. Verdict not Excessive.—Verdict for $15,000 for a left foot and ankle broken and crushed, and amputated below the knee, of a man forty-six years old and in good health, and earning §1500 per year, not excessive. Appeal from Fort Bend. Tried below before Hon. War. H. Burichart. Pearson & Ballowe, for defendant. 1. This being a ease where death did not ensue from the injury, and where the disability was only partial, the probable duration of plaintiff’s life, and his yearly earnings before he was injured, were improper foundations for the measure of damages, and .such allegations in plaintiff’s petition should have been suppressed. Railway v. Douglass, 69 Texas, 699; Wilson v. Railway, 38 Iowa, 364; 26 Iowa, 139; Pierce on Rys., 297. 2. It was error to admit the evidence of B. F. Houston, an actuary or insurance expert, to show the probable duration of plaintiff’s life, such -evidence being offered by plaintiff in connection with that as to plaintiff’s annual earnings before his injury, as the basis of the measure of damages in the case, the evidence being excepted to by defendant, because this was a case of partial and not total disability resulting from injury. Railway v. Douglass, 69 Texas, 699. 3. The court erred in refusing to give the following charge asked for by defendant, to-wit: ‘‘A higher degree of care is required of the train men at a passenger depot than at stopping places for water only.” Beach on Con. Neg., sec. 57. Gresham & Jones and Mitchell & Mitchell, for appellee. 1. Where one’s physical or mental capacity to pursue his accustomed employment or business has been permanently destroyed or permanently impaired by an accident resulting from the negligence of another person, the age and probable duration of life of the injured person, the nature and extent of that business and its antecedent pecuniary results, and his mental or physical condition before the accident, are all proper, though not always essential, matters of averment in an action by the injured party to recover damages for the injury. They are the proper subjects of proof, and what may be proved it is not error to allege. Wade v. Leroy, 20 How., 34; Luck v. Ripon, 52 Wis., 196; Kinney v. Crocker, 18 Wis., 80; Nebraska City v. Campbell, 2 Black, 590; 3 Suth. on Dam., 261-268, 716-723. 2. The testimony as to what plaintiff’s annual earnings from his accustomed occupation or business prior to the accident had been, was admissible, under the averments of plaintiff’s petition, as an aid to the jury in estimating with some degree of certainty the damages, past and prospective, sustained by him from his injuries. Nebraska City v. Campbell, 2 Black, 590; Wade v. Leroy, 20 How., 34; Kinney v. Crocker, 18 Wis., 80; Indianapolis v. Gaston, 58 Ind., 224; Welch v. Ware, 32 Mich., 77; George v.

The defendant’s train of cars, on which the plaintiff was at the time a passenger, having stopped at a station on its line of road and alongside the platform provided by the defendant for the accommodation of the public, the plaintiff had a right, without reference to the undisclosed purposes for which the train was stopped, and although the station was not the one to which the plaintiff was destined, temporarily to alight from the car, whilst stationary, on to such platform.

Any movement which is made of a railway train after it has come to a stop should be preceded by ample warning to all passengers who may be in the act of getting on; and a failure on the part of the company’s servants in charge of the train to give such warning, is actionable negligence.

"FISHER, Chief Justice. Alfred B. Bitz, deceased, in his lifetime sued the city of Austin for damages for injuries received on account of a defective and improper street in said city, by the overturning of his wagon. Suit was instituted July, 1885. The case was, in the lifetime of Alfred B. Bitz, tried, and judgment had in his favor, the date of the judgment being March 20, 1886. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court upon a cost bond. Pending the appeal, Alfred B. Bitz, on July 17, 1886, died, and left a written will bequeathing all of his property, including this judgment, to his wife Anna Bitz, one of the appellants, and making her sole executrix. The will was duly probated, and Anna Bitz qualified as sole executrix. After the death of Alfred B. Bitz, the Supreme Court, on the 4th day of December, 1888, reversed the said judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. On the 11th of November, 1889, Anna Bitz, executrix of Alfred B. Bitz, deceased, in her right as executrix, and also in her right as surviving wife, and Helen Bitz, Budolf B. Bitz, Clara Hesse, and Mary Schmidt, as the sole and only children of said Alfred B. Bitz, deceased, made themselves parties to this suit-by an amended original petition, and sought to revive this suit; the said Clara Hesse, a married woman, being joined by Paul Hesse, her husband, and Mary Schmidt, also a married woman, being joined by her husband, Victor Schmidt; the said Helen Bitz being a minor and appearing by Anna Ritz, her mother, as next friend, and a guardian ad litem being also asked to be appointed for her; the children of Alfred R. Ritz making themselves parties, provided they had any interest and were necessary parties, but they claimed no interest adverse to their mother, Anna Ritz. Appellants’ amended original petition contained two counts, By the first count they sought to revive the suit as originally brought by Alfred R. Ritz; by the second count appellants sought to change the suit so as to recover under the statute allowing the surviving wife and children to sue for damages for injuries resulting in death. Appellee answered:. 1. By a plea in abatement of the pendency of another suit for same cause of action. ■ 2. By .plea in abatement that appellants’ petition showed that suit was originally brought by Alfred R. Ritz, and that he had died, and being dead, the cause of action abated. 3. That there is a misjoinder of causes of action. Appellants seek to recover damages for personal injuries received by said Alfred R. Ritz, and for damages alleged to have been sustained by appellants by reason of death of Alfred R- Ritz. 4. General and special demurrers. 5. General denial, and special answer denying that Trinity Street at date of injury was a public streeet; that the use of the same by the public was without appellee’s knowledge or consent; that the street was in a reasonably good condition; that Alfred R. Ritz, by his own carelessness and negligence, caused the injury. The demurrers and exceptions of appellees coming on to.be heard, the court entered the following judgment: 1. The right of action, as originally brought by Alfred R. Ritz, does not survive, and that Mrs. Anna Ritz, the surviving widow, nor the said children, take nor can take any right by reason of the injury complained of to said Alfred R. Ritz prior to his death. 2- That the statutes (Revised Statutes, article 2899) do not give the right of action for injuries causing the death of a human being when caused by a municipal corporation, unless facts be alleged showing, that .such corporation is a common carrier. Also special exception pleading limitation, sustained as to the plaintiff Anna Ritz and overruled as to the Other plaintiffs. 3.. All other and special exceptions are overruled. 4. That appellants’ cause of action be dismissed. The court found and filed the following conclusions of law: 1. The Constitution (section 26, article 16) was intended to allow exemplary damages for gross negligence, and against such persons, corporations, and companies only as were liable under the statutes for actual damages. . . . . 2. A municipal corporation is not liable to a surviving spouse or children for damages for negligently causing the death of a husband and father, unless facts be alleged showing that such corporation was acting as a common carrier, and as such caused the death. Eev. Stats., art. 2899, subdiv. 1. Such corporations do not come within the purview of subdivision 2 of said article, because the word person, as therein used, evidently means natural person, and the word another means a similar or like person. 4. Defendant’s special exception pleading the statute of limitations is well taken as to plaintiff Anna Eitz, but not as to the other plaintiffs, who are shown to be married women and minors. 5. That the right of A. E. Eitz to recover damages for personal injuries occasioned by the negligence of defendant abated with his death, and plaintiff Anna Eitz, his surviving wife, can not maintain a suit'for the same or any part thereof. We will not enter into a discussion of all the questions raised under the several assignments of error, as we dispose of the case in accordance with the first and second conclusions of law arrived at by the trial court. It will be seen from these conclusions that the court sustained the demurrers, upon the grounds: 1. That municipal corporations are not embraced within the meaning of subdivisions 1 and 2 of article 2899, Eevised Statutes, as the person or class against whom the action exists for injury resulting in death. 2. That section 26, article 16, of the Constitution of this State, does not confer a right to recover exemplary damages in cases where the plaintiff is not entitled to recover actual damages. In other words, that a recovery of exemplary damages will only be permitted when under the facts the plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages. The appellants do not contend that a municipal corporation is embraced within the meaning of the first subdivision of article 2899, but contend that it is a person within the meaning of the law, and is therefore included within the second subdivision of the statutes. The statute in question is as follows: “An action for actual damages on ground of injuries causing the death of another person may be brought in the following cases: * * * When the death of any person is caused by the wrongful act or negligence or unskillfulness or fault of another.” This latter is the language of the second subdivision. The word “ person” as used in this statute is evidently meant a natural person and not an artificial person, such as a corporation. The word “another” evidently refers to another person, as a class of persons similar to that whose death is occasioned. In construing this statute, our Supreme Court, in the case of Hendrick v. Walton, 69 Texas, 192, in effect, holds, that the statutes give the remedy only against the person or individual that occasions the death, and that a principal can not be held liable under the statutes when the death of a decedent is occasioned by his agent. This construction is based upon the- broad ground that the remedy is granted solely against those expressly held liable by the terms of the statute, and that it will not be held to include others not specially mentioned; that the remedy exists alone against the person that occasioned the death by his wrongful act. It is true that the question before us was not directly involved in the case cited, but it is important in its bearing upon the construction to be placed upon the statute; it is further important as illustrative of the legislative intention to not include corporations within the meaning of the term “ persons ” as mentioned in the statute. For the corporation itself does no act that renders it liable, but its liability for actionable negligence rests upon the acts of commission or omission of its agents and public servants that are entrusted with its business affairs. It is insisted that, by force of article 3140, Revised Statutes, the word “persons” includes a corporation. The statute so says; but the article in question that undertakes to give the legal meaning to certain words says that such shall be the meaning unless a different meaning is apparent from the context. If we give to the word a literal meaning, as defined by the law, and say that it means a corporation, this would lead to the result of holding that the physical death of a corporation was possible, and that those who occasioned it should suffer the penalty of the statute. This would lead to a palpable reductio ad absurdum. The argument upon this question could be continued indefinitely, but we are content to say that the words “ person” and “another,” as used in the statute, are employed in their popular sense, and mean an individual and not an artificial person. The second conclusion of law found by the court involves the application of section 26, article 16, of the Constitution, to the facts of this case. The provision of the Constitution in question confers the remedy for exemplary damages against any person, corporation, or company that may commit a homicide through willful act or omission or gross neglect, without regard to criminal proceedings that may be had in relation to the homicide. Appellants contend that this provision of the Constitution gives an action for exemplary damages independent of those provisions of the statute that provide for recovery of actual damages, and that such exemplary damages are recoverable, although no recovery is had for actual damages. Our courts have repeatedly held that no recovery can be had for exemplary damages unless the facts are such that warrant a recovery for actual damages. Delivered November 9, 1892. We think these decisions control the question before us. The purpose of this constitutional provision was simply to create a remedy that did not exist at common law. The fact that exemplary damages are recoverable by force of this constitutional provision does not place the right upon a more certain basis or higher plain than exist in those cases in which such character of damages is recoverable at common law. In that class of cases in which it is permitted by common law to recover exemplary damages the remedy is as effective and certain as when the right is granted by the written law. Reasons upon which these decisions referred to are based will apply as well in case where the right to exemplary damages is dependent upon the written law as it does when the right flows from the common law; and in all such cases the decisions apply. We find no error in the judgment, and it is affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Key did not sit in this case. Writ of error was refused by the Supreme Court.","Anna Ritz et al. v. The City of Austin. No. 30. 1. Action for Personal Injuries to Husband Abates by His Death. — A husband sued the city of Austin for damages for personal injuries caused by alleged neglect on part of the city to keep a street in proper repair. Pending the suit the plaintiff died. The widow sought to revive the suit. Held, that the suit abated upon the husband’s death. 2. Damages for Injuries Resulting in Death. —The second subdivision of article 2899, Revised Statutes, provides that “An action for actual damages on ground of injuries causing the death of another person may be brought in the following cases: * * * Where the death of any person is caused by the wrongful act or negligence * * * of another.” As used in this statute the word person evidently means a natural person, and not an artificial person such as a corporation. The word another refers to another person as a class of persons similar to that whose death is occasioned. 3. Exemplary Damages. — A recovery of exemplary damages will only be permitted when under the facts the plaintiff is entitled to actual damages. This rule applies to section 26, article 16, of the Constitution, giving exemplary damages for a homicide through the “ willful act or omission or gross neglect.” 4. Person, Another. — In said statute, second subdivision of article 2899, the word person means only a natural person, and the word another includes only one of the same class. Appeal from Travis. Tried below before Hon. W. M. Key. Statement is given in opinion. John Dowell and Terrell & Walker, for appellants. 1.

The court erred in holding that the statute (Revised Statutes, article 2899) does not give the right of action for injuries causing the death of a human being when caused by a municipal corporation, unless facts be alleged showing that such corporation is a common carrier. 3. The court erred in sustaining the plea of the statute of limitation as to the right of Anna Ritz to sue, and in dismissing her cause of action. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., art. 3202, subdiv. 4; Scoby v.

Brown, for appellants. 1. The court erred in holding that the statute (Revised Statutes, article .2899) does not give the right of action for injuries causing the death of a human being when caused by a municipal corporation, unless facts be alleged showing that such corporation is a common carrier. The petition alleges that the city of Austin, a municipal corporation, caused the death of Alfred R. Ritz. A municipal corporation is an artificial person; this is sufficient under the statute. Sayles’ Civ. Stats., arts. 2899, 2903, 2904, 2906, 2907; Bartee v. Railway, 36 Texas, 648; Chase v. Steamboat Co., 10 R. I., 79; Douglass v. Steamship Co., 4 Cal., 304; People v. Ins.

The court erred in its conclusions of law in holding that section 26, article 16, of the State Constitution, was intended to allow exemplary damages for gross negligence against such persons only as were liable under the statute for actual damages. The question of exemplary damages as held by the court was, that as the statute gave no actual damages there could be no exemplary damages; but the above authorities show that the statute does allow a right of action for actual damages. In law there are two classes of persons — one natural, the other artificial. Whenever a statute uses the word person, it means, unless qualified, both natural and artificial. This is the interpretation given it by Mr. Lawson in his Rights, Remedies, and Practice (volume 3, section 1017), in' which he uses the following language: “ The action to be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent, and child, and to be brought in the name of the executor or administrator within twelve months after the death. Similar statutes exist, with some difference of detail, in most of the States. The statutes are remedial in their nature, and should be liberally construed. They include corporations causing the death as well as natural persons.” In 4 California, 304, the following language is used: “The word person, in its legal signification, is a generic term, and was intended to include artificial as well as natural persons.” In the Texas case of Bartee v. Railway, 36 Texas, 648, the following language is used: “ Our statute confers a right of action against persons committing a trespass, in whatever county the trespass is committed. But it is urged that a railway company is not a person within the meaning of this provision of the law. * * * A railway company is an artificial person, and for many purposes is regarded in the law as subject to the same responsibilities and liabilities as natural persons.” In Stewart v. Waterloo Turn Verein, 1 American Decisions, 114, a corporation • is defined to be “a person subject to a penalty within a statute prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors, and is liable for such a sale by its committee at a ball given by it.” Geo. F. Pendexter, for appellee. 1. The court did not err in holding that the cause of action declared on in the original suit brought by A. R. Bitz did not survive to appellants. Said suit was brought to recover damages for injuries to the person of A. B. Bitz, and the right of action abated with his death. Railway v. Richards, 68 Texas, 378. 2. The right of action for injuries resulting in death is purely statutory, and article 2899, Bevised Statutes, does not in express terms or by fair implication render a municipal corporation liable therefor. Hendrick v. Walton, 69 Texas, 192. 3. The court did not err in holding that section 26, article 16, of the Constitution of Texas, was intended to allow exemplary damages for gross negligence against such persons, corporations, and companies only as were liable under the statute for actual damages. The law in force at the date of the adoption of the present Constitution did not render municipal corporations liable for actual damages for injuries resulting in death. JPasch. Dig., art. 15. 4. The right of action of Mrs. Anna Bitz was barred by the statute of limitation of one year, and the court did not err in so holding. A. B. Bitz, husband of the appellant Anna Bitz, died July 17, 1886. The amended petition, which first asserted the claim of Anna Bitz, was filed November 11, 1889. Railway v. Kutac, 72 Texas, 649; Railway v. Bradley, 45 Texas, 180; Railway v.

"KEY, Associate Justice. Findings of facts. 1. That a man by the name of Green B. Jamison went from the State of North Carolina to Texas in the year 1835 or 1836, and enlisted in the Texas army in the war between Texas and Mexico, and was killed in what is called ‘ ‘ Fannin’s Massacre,” at Goliad, Texas. 2.

That during the war between Texas and Mexico he was a soldier in the Texas army, and was killed at the battle of the Alamo, Texas, in 1836. 6. That at the time of his death he was a resident citizen of Brazoria Count)'-, Texas. 7. That plaintiff John Jamison is not an heir of said Green B. Jami-son who was a resident of Brazoria County. 8. That said Green B. Jamison was never married. 9. That he was the son of William and Jane Jamison, and said parents-are dead. 10. That Mary S. Jamison was a sister of Green B.; that in 1819 she married Pouncy Nuckols, who is dead, and that Mary S. is dead. 11. That the defendant S. L. Jamison is a daughter of Pouncy and Mary S. Nuckols, born in 1830. 12. That the father, mother, and following named brothers and sisters of Green B. Jamison survived him, to-wit: Gillie Ann Jamison, Mary S. Jamison, Julia Ann Jamison, Emily Jamison, Estang Jamison, Eloísa Jamison, Willis Jamison, and Hawkins Jamison, some of whom are probably living, but others are dead, without issue living. 13. That on the 18th day of June, 1851, a bounty warrant or certificate-for 1920 acres of land issued to said last mentioned Green B. Jamison. 14. That by virtue of said bounty warrant a patent from the State of Texas issued to the heirs of said Green B. Jamison, dated on the 23rd day of November, 1875. 15. That at the February Term, 1837, of the Probate Court of Brazoria County, Texas, Henry Austin was appointed administrator of the-estate of said Green B. Jamison. 16. That at the February Term, 1838, of said Probate Court, said' Henry Austin exhibited his account as administrator of said estate, and at his request he was allowed to surrender the estate, and was discharged from the trust, and surrendered the books, accounts, and assets of the-estate. 17. That at said February Term, 1838, of said court, after said discharge of said Henry Austin as administrator as aforesaid, Willis A. Farris was appointed administrator of said estate, who accepted said appointment. 18. That at the June Term, 1840, of said Probate Court, Thomas R. Davis was appointed administrator of said estate. 19. That at the May Term, 1841, of said Probate Court, said Davis reported to said court that he was unable to find any property belonging to said estate, and at his request his letters of administration were revoked and his bond cancelled. 20. That at the December Term, 1856, Thomas G. Masterson was appointed administrator de bonis non of said estate, and qualified as required by law. 21. That from the revocation of the letters of administration to Davis at the May Term, 1841, of said court, to the appointment of Masterson in 1856, no other order was entered in said court in regard to said estate. 22. That on the first Tuesday in August, 1861, said bounty warrant was sold at public outcry, and purchased by J. W. Grafton at the sum of 35} cents per acre, he being the highest and best bidder therefor. 23. That the authority of said Probate Court to said administrator Masterson to sell said warrant was obtained regularly and according to the forms of law in such cases made and provided; that the sale was legally advertised and the warrant was sold at the time and place and in the manner prescribed by law; that the report of the sale by Masterson and confirmation of the same by said court were regular and legal, as were all the acts of the administrator and orders of the court in regard to the sale of said warrant. 24. That pursuant to the order of said court, said Masterson, on the 11th day of October, 1861, conveyed said warrant to the said purchaser, John W. Grafton, by written transfer, which was duly acknowledged on the 12th of February, 1870, and recorded in Lampasas County on the 27th day of December, 1875. 25. That on the 2d day of February, 1870, said John W. Grafton conveyed said warrant to William E. Dodge; said conveyance was recorded in Lampasas County on the 27th day of December, 1875. 26. That Melissa P. Dodge is executrix, and William E. Dodge, Jr., and D. Stuart Dodge are the executors of the estate of William E. Dodge, now deceased, and are the intervenors in this case. 27. That on the 12th day of November, 1877, Mary S. Nuckols, the surviving wife of Pouncy Nuckols, and sister of Green B. Jamison, conveyed an undivided half-interest in the land so granted as aforesaid to the heirs of said Green B. Jamison, to J. T. Smith, and which was recorded in Lampasas County, on the 6th day of April, 1877. 28. That on the 12th day of July, 1879, said J. T. Smith conveyed to A. H. Montgomery an undivided fourth of said 1920 acres of land, and which was duly recorded in Lampasas County on the 14th day of August, 1879. 29. That under a deed from A. F. Baker and wife, Emma Baker, dated October 21, 1882, the defendant E. Phelan purchased an undivided fourth-interest in said land, which was properly conveyed by mesne conveyances from said J. T. Smith to said A. F. Baker and wife. 30. That on the 29th day of March, 1884, the defendant Evan Phelan leased the land in controversy from the intervenors in this case, said -lease to continue until the 1st day of January, 1887. After the expiration of the lease, the defendant Phelan reasserted his right to said land, and took possession of the land for himself and his codefendants, except Montgomery. 31. That J. T. Smith conveyed an undivided fourth-interest in the land in controversy to Charles Haughn, by deed dated March 12, 1877, which deed was recorded in Lampasas County on March 28, 1877, and the defendant Phelan holds by regular chain of title from said ('harles Haughn. 32. That sometime in the spring of 1887, the attorney of the estate of William E. Dodge demanded of the defendant E. Phelan to know whether he wished to surrender the land leased to him by the intervenors on March 29, 1884, and the defendant Phelan then promised to give the intervenors a reply in a few days; and that afterwards, about May 1, 1887, said Phelan accepted a lease from W. K. Henderson, as administrator of Mary S, Nuckols and S. L. Jamison, without having surrendered said land to intervenors, and has since that time held the same for himself and as a tenant of said W. K. Henderson and S. L. Jamison. 33. The evidence does not show that Mary S. Nuckols was a party to the partition proceedings in the Probate Court of Brazoria County had in 1861, when said 1920 acres certificate was sold; but it does show that-Mary Nichols was a party thereto, represented by an attorney appointed by the court. 34. Masterson’s appointment as administrator de bonis non was made on the following application: ‘ ‘ The State of Texas, County of Brazoria.—To the Hon. S. W. Perkins, Chief Justice of Brazoria County: Your petitioner, Thomas G. Master-son, respectfully represents to your honor, that sometime in the year 1836 Green B. Jamison, a resident of Brazoria County, departed this life intestate. That sometime in the year 1837 Captain Henry Austin took out. letters of administration on the estate of said Green B. Jamison, but in 1837 or 1838 he surrendered to the honorable Probate Court said letters, without having fully administered said estate. He further represents, that said estate or the heirs thereof are entitled to considerable land from the government of Texas, and that the heir of said Jamison has requested your petitioner to ask for letters of administration on said estate, in order that said land claim may be gotten from the said government. Your petitioner therefore prays for letters de bonis non upon said estate, and for all other and necessary orders touching the same. “Filed December 9, 1856. [Signed] “ Thomas G. Masterson.” Opinion.—This suit was instituted by John Jamison, as plaintiff, against E. Phelan, as defendant, to recover 1920 acres of land, patented by the State to the heirs of Green B. Jamison. Melissa P. Dodge, W. E. Dodge, Jr., and D. Stuart Dodge, as executrix and executors of the estate of William E. Dodge, deceased, intervened, claiming the land for said estate, and impleaded William B., Mattie, Carrie B., Nannie M., and Bessie Montgomery, Mrs. S. L. Jamison (a feme sole), W. K. Henderson (as administrator of the estate of Mary S. Nuckols), and the unknown heirs of said Mary S. Nuckols. E. Phelan impleaded two of his warrantors, asking, in the event that he lost the land claimed by him, for judgment against said warrantors. There was no jury in the case, and the court rendered judgment against the plaintiff and also against the intervenors, and in favor of defendants as follows: Mrs. Mary S. Nuckols’ estate and Mrs. S. L. Jamison, one-half; E. Phelan, one-fourth; the Montgomerys, one-fourth; and for Ellis, and Baker, Phelan’s warrantors, for costs. Intervenors, the representatives of the Dodge estate, have appealed. The title of the Dodge estate is founded upon a sale made in August,. 1861, by Thomas G. Masterson, as administrator of the estate of Green B. Jamison, and the first assignment of error challenges the correctness of the court’s ruling in holding that the letters of administration granted to said Masterson as administrator de bonis non of said estate were nullities. Green B. Jamison, to whom the certificate issued by virtue of which the land in controversy was patented, was killed at the Alamo in 1836, and between February, 1837, and July, 1840, three successive adminis-"" trators of his estate had been appointed by the Probate Court of Brazoria County; and in May, 1841, Thomas B. Davis, the last of the three, reported to the court that he was unable to find any property belonging to the estate, and at his request his letters of administration were revoked and his bond cancelled. After the revocation of Davis’ letters of administration, no other order was made by said court in regard to the estate until the December Term, 1856, at which time Thomas G. Masterson was appointed administrator de bonis non of the estate. Under the laws in force from 1836 to 1846, the term of an administration was limited to one year only, but could, upon sufficient cause shown, be extended by the court from year to year, not exceeding five years. Davis, the last administrator before Masterson, was appointed in June, 1840. Under the law as it then existed, his administration would have terminated in June, 1841, unless an order was made continuing it another year. This was not done; but on the contrary, in May, 1841, his letters were revoked and his bond cancelled. If this last action of the court did not close the administration, then the failure to make an order continuing it after June, 1841, did close it; and -there being no administration pending in 1856, when Masterson was appointed administrator de bonis non, the action of the court appointing him was null and void. That the admistration had terminated, see, Flores v. Howth, 5 Texas, 329; Boyle v. Forbes, 9 Texas, 36; Murphy v. Menard, 14 Texas, 65; Portis v. Cummings, 14 Texas, 139. It becomes unnecessary, therefore, to decide the effect to be given to the fact that nothing was done in the Probate Court for over fifteen years prior to Masterson’s appointment, or to consider other matters bearing upon the validity thereof. It is also contended, that Mary S. Nuckols was a party to the probate proceedings in which Masterson sold the certificate, and that she and those claiming under her are estopped. The evidence does not sustain this contention. It shows that Mary Nichols was represented in the partition proceedings by an attorney appointed by the court. But Nuckols and Nichols are not the same names. But if they were, the facts disclosed fall far short of an estoppel. The judgment being void, the mere fact of an attorney appointed by the court appearing for Mary Nuckols would not operate as an estoppel against her, in the absence of proof that she received any benefit under the judgment. It is insisted, however, that appellants were entitled to recover, on the theory that appellee Phelan had become their tenant, and was holding over after the expiration of the lease. It is shown, that in March, 1884, while Phelan in fact owned an undivided interest in the land, he entered into a lease contract with appellants for the whole of it for a term of three years, and agreed to surrender possession at the expiration of the lease. At the time of making the lease contract, appellants’ attorney told Phelan, that in his opinion the appellants’ title to the land was superior to the title Phelan had acquired from the heirs of Green B. Jamison. When the term of the lease ended, Phelan refused to surrender possession, and held the same for himself and as tenant of Mrs. S. L. Jamison and the estate of Mrs. Mary Nuckols. These facts brought Phelan within one of the exceptions to the general rule which does not permit a tenant to dispute his landlord’s title. Holding under a superior title to the Dodge estate, the law permits him to repudiate Ms tenancy and dispute the title of his landlord. McKie v. Anderson, 78 Texas, 207. We find no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 15, 1893.","Melissa P. Dodge et al. v. E. Phelan et al. No. 72. 1. Void Administration.—Intestate died in 1836 at the Alamo, a resident of Brazoria County. At the February term, 1837, of the Probate Court of said county, Henry Austin was appointed administrator. At the February term, 1838, Austin rendered an exhibit and account and was permitted to resign, and he surrendered the assets. At the same term Ferris was appointed and accepted. At the June term, 1840, one Davis was appointed administrator, and at the May term, 1841, hé reported that he was unable to find any property of the estate, and at his own request his letters of administration were revoked. At the December term, 1856, Masterson was appointed administrator de bonis non of the estate, and qualified. In August, 1861, Masterson as administrator sold a bounty land warrant issued in the name of the deceased. This sale was regular in form, and was apapproved, and deed made to the purchaser. In a suit by heirs against parties holding under said sale, held: 1. Under the laws in force from 1836 to 1846 the term of administration was limited to one year only, but could be extended from year to year not exceeding five years. 2. If the act of the court, May, 1841, revoking the letters to Davis, did not close the administration, the failure to make an order to continue it after June, 1841, did close it. . 3. There being no administration pending in 1856, the action of the court appointing Masterson was null and void, and his sale passed no title. 2. Estoppel, Facts Held not to be—In the close of an administration held void for want of jurisdiction, that an heir was represented in partition by counsel appointed by the court does not estop the heir from attacking the administration, it not appearing that the heir received any of the assets from the administrator. 3. Idem Sonans.—Nuckols and Nichols are not idem sonans. 4. Tenant Repudiating Lease.—A tenant holding under a superior title may repudiate his tenancy under another, and dispute the title of his landlord. Appeal from Lampasas. Tried below before Hon. W. A. Blackburn. W. B. Abney, for appellants. 1. The County Court of Brazoria County was a court of record'of general jurisdiction over all matters relating to the administration of the estates of deceased persons; and having assumed to exercise jurisdiction in the appointment of Thos. G-. Masterson as administrator de bonis non of the estate of Green B. Jamison, all presumptions are in favor of the validity of its proceedings; and if the record of said court shows that the steps necessary to clothe it with power to act in said case were taken, or if the record be silent upon this point, then its judgment, order, or decree must be held conclusive in any other court of the same sovereignty, when collaterally called in question. Martin v. Robinson, 67 Texas, 370; Bradley v. Love, 60 Texas, 475; Brockenborough v. Melton, 55 Texas, 493; Murchison v. White, 54 Texas, 82; Guilford v. Love, 49 Texas, 715; Kleinecke v.

The estate of Green B. Jamison being unsettled in December, 1856, and being unrepresented, the Probate Court had the power to appoint an administrator de bonis non to close up said estate; and having appointed an administrator de bonis non, a sale made by him under an order of said court, for the purpose of partition and distribution among the heirs, and approved by said court, would divest the heirs of any title to the property sold. Pasch. Dig., art. 1350. 3. The defendants having deraigned title through Mary S. Nuckols, who was a party to the partition proceedings in the Probate Court of Brazoria County, under which the 1920 acres certificate covering the land in controversy was sold, are estopped from setting up any invalidity of said sale for partition. Edwards v. Dickson, 66 Texas, 613; Favill v. Roberts, 50 N. Y., 222; Bige. on Estop., 479, 480. Essex & Prigmore, for appellees the Montgomerys. 1. The administration on the estate of Green B. Jamison was closed in 1841 by the revocation of the letters of Thomas R. Davis, the cancellation of his bond, and his release from further liability; the estate, if there was any, being then fully administered for all purposes except partition and distribution, and whatever portion of the estate then remained vested in the heirs, and could only be divested for the payment of debts, if at all. Withers v. Patterson, 27 Texas, 500; Fisk v. Norvel, 9 Texas, 13; Hurt v. Horton, 12 Texas, 288; Blair v. Cisneros, 10 Texas, 36. 2. After the lapse of fifteen years from the discharge of Davis, in 1841, without any further order in said administration, either extending the same or in some way recognizing its existence, and in the absence of any person acting in the capacity of administrator, the court will presume that the administration was closed; and this presumption could only be rebutted by proof that a necessity for administration existed.

Robinson, 67 Texas, 368. Mathews & Wood, for appellee Phelan.— 1. The estate of Green B. Jamison having vested in his heirs long before the passage of the act of 1848 governing the administration of the estates of deceased persons, the administration granted in 1856, through which appellants claim, was a nullity.

Cummings, 14 Texas, 139. 2. The record does not show that Mary S. Nuckols was a party to the partition proceedings in 1861, under which the land certificate was sold. The transcript of the proceedings of the Probate Court shows, that ‘1 Mary Nichols, who resides in Alabama, was represented by C. Terry, attorney at law.” Appellee Phelan does not claim through Mary Nichols, but through Mary S. Nuckols."
"HEAD, Associate Justice. On the 27th day of January, 1877, patents were issued to Grimes County for four leagues of land, granted to it for educational purposes by virtue of an act approved January 15, 1850. The 160 acres of land in controversy in this suit is a part of this land, being embraced in league 146. On the 19th of April, 1886, the Commissioners Court of Grimes County, at a regular term of said court, ordered that the four leagues of land mentioned above be sold, and directed the county judge of Grimes County to advertise the sale thereof. In pursuance of this order, the county judge duly advertised said land for sale in the Dallas Morning News. The land was offered for sale on not less than ten years time, with interest payable annually in advance, and the advertisement stated that bids would be received until the 25th day of June, 1886, the court reserving the right to reject any and all bids. In pursuance of this offer to sell, T. C. Buffington, L. McDaniel, and Jack Baker bid for said four leagues the sum of $2.45 per acre, on twenty years time, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, payable annually in advance, the interest to commence to run from the 1st day of September, 1886, and payable on or before October 1 of each and every year; the purchase money, principal and interest, being secured by a vendor’s lien on the land. This offer was accepted by the Commissioners Court and the sale confirmed. At the July term, 1886, said Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker complied with their bids, and deeds were executed to them. Appellant claims under a regular chain of transfers from these purchasers, but it was agreed that her rights against appellee were only such as the purchasers from the county could enforce. Appellee settled on the land in controversy in the spring of 1885, and put up a small box-house thereon in October, 1885, and dug a well, fenced and put in cultivation the first year about 4 acres, and had under-fence at the time of the sale by Grimes County about 80 acres; and at that time she was an actual settler on the land within the meaning of section 6 of article 7 of our Constitution. At this time appellee was a widow and had four children, two of whom were under 21 years of age,, and she made this settlement with the intention of making it her permanent home. At the time of the death of her husband, which occurred in Tarrant County, previous to the settlement of appellee upon this land, she was living with him upon a tract of 100 acres of land, which was his separate property, in Tarrant County, and at the time of his death this was their home, and this land is still owned by appellee and the children of her deceased husband. The improvements placed by appellee upon the land in controversy are worth $433. At the time appellee settled upon this land she had abandoned her homestead upon the 100 acres in Tarrant County, with the intention of not again returning to it. On the 12th of November, 1886, appellee, through her attorney, H. L. Bentley, tendered to the Commissioners Court of Grimes County the notes and cash payment which would be due from her on a purchase upon the same terms as the sale made by said county to Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker, estimating the 160 acres claimed by her at $2.45 per acre, the price at which the four leagues were sold as aforesaid. This tender was made under the following circumstances: Mr. Bentley appeared before the Commissioners Court of Grimes County and offered and tendered the amount due as cash payment on the land, and also tendered the notes for the deferred payments. The Commissioners Court told him that it was not necessary to count the money, and they expressly waived the counting of the same, and told Mr. Bentley that the court had nothing to do with it. Afterwards Mr. Bentley made a tender in the same way of the notes and money to Buffington, who, on behalf of himself, McDaniel, and Baker, refused to accept the same, and said that he preferred to make his own sales. Appellee had no actual notice of the sale to Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker until Baker, sometime after the sale, came to place the deeds to himself and others on record. They were filed for record in Taylor County September 15, 1886. This tender was also made by appellee in this case, and the money and notes deposited in court. Under this state of facts, appellee in her answer insisted upon her prior right to acquire the land in controversy under the section of our Constitution above referred to, and this appeal is prosecuted from a judgment in her favor recognizing such right. Appellant in her first assignment of error insists, that inasmuch as appellee was the owner of an interest in other land, and entitled to a homestead right thereon, she was not an actual settler upon this land within the meaning of section 6 of article 7 of our Constitution; and in support of this contention cites us to several cases which, in effect, hold that under such circumstances appellee could not acquire a pre-emption homestead under the law. These decisions we understand to be based upon our statute in reference to this last named class of claimants. Before any one can acquire a pre-emption homestead under our statute, he is required to make affidavit “ that he is without any homstead of his own” (Revised Statutes, article 3939); and under this statute it has several times been held, that one who already has a homestead is not entitled to acquire other land by pre-emption. Gambrell v. Steele, 55 Texas, 582; Daughty v. Hall, 59 Texas, 518; Garrison v. Grant, 57 Texas, 602. No such requirement, however, is made of actual settlers who are given the prior right to purchase county school land by the section of our Constitution cited above. This section provides: “Each county may sell or dispose of its lands, in whole or in part, in manner to be provided by the Commissioners Court of such county. Actual settlers residing on said lands shall be protected in their prior right of purchasing the same to the extent of their settlement, not to exceed 160 acres, at the price fixed by said court, which price shall not include the value of existing improvements made thereon by such settler.” The letter of our pre-emption statute certainly does not include this class of settlers, nor do we think its spirit includes them. Pre-emption settlers are given their homesteads as a gratuity, but this class of settlers can only acquire the land claimed by them by paying the same price that the Commissioners Court sells to other parties. They are given nothing but the prior right of purchasing, and thereby enabled to save their improvements. It will therefore readily be seen that reasons exist why those owning lands should not be allowed to acquire homesteads upon the public land which would not exist in the case of those given the prior right to purchase from the counties, and we are of opinion that the fact that appellee may have been entitled to a homestead upon other land was not a bar to her becoming an actual settler upon this land within the meaning of our Constitution. In her second assignment of error appellant complains, that judgment was rendered for appellee for 160 acres, when the evidence showed that she had only settled upon 80 acres, but we are of opinion that the judgment in this respect is correct. In Perego v. White, 77 Texas, 196, it is said: “We think it follows, therefore, that a purchaser of school lands from a county, upon which an actual settler is residing, who has not been afforded an opportunity to buy, takes it subject to his privilege of pre-emption, and that the settler, upon a tender with reasonable promptness of the value of the land upon which he has settled, estimated upon the basis of the price actually paid or agreed to be paid for the whole tract bought of the county, may demand a conveyance of 160 acres, or a less amount as he may elect.” We do not believe it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution to limit an actual settler in such case to the land he might actually have enclosed at the time of the sale by the county, but the language relied upon by appellant was intended to restrict this prior right of purchasing to 160 acres, even though the settler might have had a greater quantity enclosed. In her third assignment of error appellant complains of the judgment rendered in the court below, because neither the pleadings of appellee nor the evidence shows the relative value of the 160 acres adjudged to her when compared with the whole four leagues purchased by Buffington, McDaniel, and Baker from the county. It must be conceded that this is a close question; but we are of opinion, that inasmuch as the sale by the county was made by the acre, without reference to any difference in its value, and inasmuch as appellant interposed no exception to the pleadings of appellee upon this ground, and offered no evidence to show that there was a difference in the value of the land, the court did not err in holding the tender made by appellee sufficient, and fixing the amount to be paid by her at its proportion of the price at which the whole tract had been sold. We think this evidence sufficient to sustain the finding of the court that this was its relative value. See Ward v. Worsham, 78 Texas, 180. We think it has several times, in effect, been held in this State, that a sale made by a County Commissioners Court under the same circumstances that this one was made by the Commissioners Court of Grimes-County was not such a proceeding in rem as to bar the rights of the actual settler, as contended by appellant in her fourth assignment. The Constitution guarantees this right of prior purchase to the actual settler, and the Commissioners Court has no power to deprive her of this right by a proceeding in rem, or any other ex parte proceeding which would have that effect. The Commissioners Court derives its power to make these sales from the same section of the Constitution which guaranteed this •prior right of purchasing to the actual settler, and by this section of the Constitution the right of the court to sell was made subject to the prior right of the settler to purchase. Perego v. White, and Ward v. Worsham, supra; Baker v. Dunning, 77 Texas, 28. As said by us in the case of Baker v. Hillman, this day decided [post, p. 345] “ It seems to us that this proceeding of the Commissioners Court should be regarded rather as an act of agency in the sale of land than the exercise of a judicial function.” We consider it no longer an open question, that the section of our Constitution quoted above applies to actual settlers who might thereafter enter upon this character of land, as well as to those on it at the time of its adoption. Baker v. Dunning, 77 Texas, 28. Let the judgment of the court below be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered February 7, 1893.","Cordella A. H. Baker v. Margaret Burroughs. No. 93. 1. County School Land —Actual Settler’s Right of Purchase.— An actual settler upon county school land can not he denied his preference right as such to purchase 160 acres thereof, because he is the owner of an interest in other land, and entitled to a homestead right thereon. 2. Same—Right not Limited to Actual Enclosure.—The prior right to purchase county school land guaranteed to an actual settler "" to the extent of his settlement, not to exceed 1G0 acres,'"" is not thereby limited to the amount he has enclosed, if such amount be less than 160 acres. 3. Same — Tender of Purchase Price.—Where four leagues of county school lands are sold by the county in gross at so much per acre, without reference to any difference in value, and the purchaser brings suit for 160 acres'thereof against an actual settler who has tendered therefor the same price per acre, payable on the same terms, as in the sale made by the county, if the plaintiff in such action fails to object that the settler has not shown the relative value of the ICO acres, and himself offers no proof of any difference in value, the tender will be deemed sufficient. 4. Same —Proceeding in Rem. — The sale of a county’s school lands by the Commissioners Court thereof is not such a proceeding in rem as will bar the prior right of purchase given by the Constitution to an actual settler thereon. Appeal from Taylor. Tried below before Hon. T. H. Conner. Sayles & Sayles, for appellant. 1. The court erred in holding that appellee, who, at the time of her settlement on the land in controversy, had, and at the date of the trial still had and owned, an estate for life and a homestead right in 100 acres of land in Tarrant County, Texas, was an actual settler on the Grimes County school land within the meaning of the Constitution and laws, and as such entitled to a prior right of purchasing the same.

The court erred in rendering judgment in favor of the defendant and appellee, upon the pleadings and facts in evidence, in that the value of the land claimed by defendant, as compared with the aggregate value of the entire tract sold to plaintiff’s vendors, was not alleged in her pleadings or shown in evidence, and no offer was made to pay the just value of the land which she claimed the right to purchase.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. This is an appeal from a judgment rendered in the District Court of Collin County, in favor of appellee as plaintiff and against appellant as defendant, for the sum of $500. The suit was brought to recover damages amounting to $800, alleged to be due to the action of appellant in pulling down appellee’s pasture fence while building its line of railway, and to appellant’s failure to construct proper cattle guards, and in permitting stock to enter appellee’s pasture and to remain depredating thereon. On the trial, the plaintiff introduced witnesses who testified as to the injury from incursions or depredations of stock, fixing upon the injury to the grass with reference to its use as a pasture, and also upon the injury to the sod and permanent injury to the pasture. To this testimony the defendant objected, “ because there was no allegation of permanent injury to the pasture or to the sod, but that the only allegation of injury in this connection was as to the grass.” The action of the court in overruling this objection is assigned as error. Among the allegations in the petition are the following: “ Large numbers of horses, hogs, mules, cattle, and sheep went into said enclosure and trespassed upon the same from the 1st day of July, 1886, until the 31st day of January next following, and ate up and tramped down and destroyed the grass growing upon plaintiff’s said pasture; that plaintiff’s said pasture was grazed down and tramped up to such an extent by the1' stock that the grass thereon was destroyed and killed, and that it did not furnish a sufficient pasturage for plaintiff’s stock during the winter and spring of 1887; that for four months during the year 1886 the defendants unlawfully caused 200 head of its stock to be herded in plaintiff's enclosure.” The term “pasture” includes not only the grass growing upon the ground, but the ground or sod itself upon which the grass grows; and when, in connection with the remaining averments set out, it is alleged, in effect, that the ground or sod was so ‘ ‘ tramped up ’ ’ that ‘ ‘ the grass growing thereon was killed,” we think, in the absence of special exception, at least, that this averment should be held to charge injury to the sod, or permanent injury. No special exception on account of the absence of such an allegation was addressed to the petition. Attempts to take advantage of a defective pleading by objection to the admissibility of evidence are not regarded with great favor. The pleading, on the other hand, is under such circumstances liberally interpreted. Black v. Drury, 24 Texas, 289; Holstein v. Adams, 72 Texas, 489. The plaintiff testified, among other matters, as follows: “The value of the use of the grass from September 2 to the last of June was $200 per month. During this time I had about 80 or 100 head of my own stock in the pasture. There were as many or inore stock in there during all of said time than those that belonged tome.” The defendant objected to this testimony, because it was not shown that the “ use by defendant or the occupancy of the pasture by defendant was exclusive, or that plaintiff had no use of same during that time, or that the grass was totally destroyed.” Appellant assigns as error the overruling of this objection, contending that the testimony as to the value of the use of the pasture during the period named is “ irrelevant and misleading as indicating a measure of damages, since the value as a pasture was shared by plaintiff and the destruction was not total.” It would, in our opinion, have been difficult for a jury to estimate the damage arising from the partial use of the pasture by defendant’s stock, in the absence of proof as to the value of the use of the entire pasture for the term stated. The value of the use in part which the jury had to determine could best be ascertained by the knowledge of the use of the pasture in its entirety. As the use of the pasture by defendant was not exclusive, it was the duty of the court to guard it against being liable to the extent of the use by plaintiff’s stock. This the court in its charge amply did. The assignment is therefore without merit. Appellant’s third assignment of error is as follows: “The court erred in its charge to the jury, viz.: ‘ If you find in favor of plaintiff, the measure of his damage will be such sum as will, as a present payment in cash, fairly and reasonably compensate him for the value of any of the growing grass on said pasture that may have been eaten by stock not belonging to him, and which stock entered through the opening or openings you may find were wrongfully left by defendant, as aforesaid; also for any damage to the land as a future pasture that may have been caused by such stock tramping down the sod thereon.’ In this the court erred in fixing upon such sum as will 1 as a present payment in cash,’ and indicated an improper measure of damage because the estimate of damage would be reckoned from the extent of the injury at the time of occasion, with 8 per cent interest; and said charge was further objectionable in that the jury were directed to consider ‘ the value of any of the growing grass, also any damage to the land as a future pasture, ’ whereas there was no allegation of permanent injury to the land, or permanent injury to the pasture. ’ ’ We have alread)r held to be untenable the proposition contained in the foregoing assignment, to the effect that there was no allegation of permanent injury to the pasture, and hence no basis for an instruction in regard to “ damage to land as a future pasture.” We are hence brought to the inquiries: 1st. Did the court err in submitting as a measure of damage “ such sum as will, as a present payment in cash, fairly and reasonably compensate the plaintiff for the value of any of the growing grass on said pasture that may have been eaten by stock not belonging to him ?” 2nd. Does this instruction, if erroneous, require a reversal of the judgment ? Reading this charge in connection with the evidence, it is apparent that the court meant, and that the jury must have understood, that the value mentioned referred to the value of the grass at the time of its consumption. According to the rule the proper measure of damage was the value of the grass at this date, with 8 per cent interest, to be computed to the time of the trial. Railway v. Joachimi, 58 Texas, 456; Railway v. Young, 60 Texas, 204. The reason for the rule evidently is, that by this test the jury can best estimate what, as a payment in cash at the time of the trial, will serve as a fair and reasonable compensation for the property (in this case the grass) consumed. The court in this instance instructed the jury as to the proper end to be kept in view in its deliberations. It only failed to charge the jury as to the means by which that end could be reached. The error was; therefore, one of omission and not of commission. Appellant has failed to show that any improper evidence was admitted by the court, misleading the jury in seeking the proper assessment of damages. Under such circumstances it would seem to have been the duty of the appellant to ask a special instruction covering the omission. Railway v. Joachimi, 58 Texas, 460; Railway v. Delaliunty, 53 Texas, 213. Besides, appellant offered no evidence on flip trial. It acquiesced in the error of omission referred to, which we can not, from the record, apprehend to have in any way misled the jury to the prejudice of appellant. Such error does not call for a reversal of the judgment. Hollingsworth v. Holshousen, 17 Texas, 47; Cook v. Wootters, 42 Texas, 294; Houston County v. Dwyer, 59 Texas, 114. Delivered November 22, 1892. We are unable to sustain appellant’s fourth assignment of error, to the effect that “ the verdict was excessive, because the only competent evidence as to damage to the pasture was too intangible and uncertain to estimate.’ ’ There was evidence from which the jury could deduce the value of the grass destroyed by stock trespassing on the pasture on account of the negligence of appellant, which with other sources of damage not complained of by appellant would amply justify the amount of the verdict. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Head did not sit in this case.","The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. J. E. Jones. No. 35. 1. Pleading — Allegation and Proof — Special Exception. — Attempts to take advantage of a defective pleading by objections to the admissibility of evidence are not regarded with favor; and where no special exception has been urged against such defect, the pleading will, in this respect, be liberally interpreted. 2. Damages — Measure of, for Grass Consumed. — Where plaintiff sues for damages occasioned by permitting stock to enter his pasture and depredate thereon, the measure of his damages, as to the grass consumed, is its value at the time of its consumption, with legal interest thereon, to be computed to the time of trial. 3. Charge of Court — Harmless Error. — An error of omission in the charge of the court, where no special instruction was asked covering such omission, and where it does not appear from the record that the jury were misled by such error, will not be ground for a reversal of the judgment. Appeal from Collin. Tried below before Hon. H. O. Head. J. W. Terry and Alexander & Clark, for appellant. 1.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. W. E. Harrington and wife brought suit in the District Court of Grayson County against C. H. McFarland and the city of Sherman, to recover their alleged homestead in said city, which went off on demurrer; and from that judgment, rendered on the 25th day of December, 1889, this appeal is prosecuted. Appellants alleged in their petition, to which demurrers were sustained,, that on the 7th day of March, 1887, they owned in community right a. homestead in the city of Sherman, which was occupied by them as such,, they being husband and wife and having one child; that at said date the-city of Sherman claimed an indebtedness against W. E. Harrington of $4000, due from him as a defaulting tax collector of said city, and that, he had embezzled said sum; that R G. Hall, Jake Levy, M. Schneider, J. H. Brittain, Jot Gunter, W. H. AVilliams, A. W. Gray, and A. Harrington were his sureties on his official bond, and that a suit was pending in the District Court of said county against W. E. Harrington and sureties, to recover the amount above named; that about the same time the sureties, or most of them, held a meeting and sent A. Harrington to Janie Harrington, appellant herein, to tell her that if she did not sign the. deed to the lot in controversy, they would prosecute her husband and, send him to the penitentiary; that she was unwilling to sign the deed,, but was so frightened at said threat, and was so alarmed for the safety of her husband, that on the 7th day of March, 1887, she and her husband did sign and acknowledge the deed by which they conveyed the property in controversy to said city, the same being worth about $2500; that the sole consideration for the conveyance ivas the payment of said indebtedness; that R G. Hall and J. W. Levy, two of the sureties who made the threat, were at the time the deed was made aldermen of said city, and were present at the meeting of the council of said city at which the deed was accepted by it, and thereby the said city had notice of the fact that she had been induced by threats to sign the deed, and that she did not sign the same willingly; that she was not examined privily by the officer who took her acknowledgment, but that J. AY. Levy, one of the said sureties who had threatened her, was present when the acknowledgment was taken, and that the deed was not explained to her by the officer; and that C. H. McFarland bought the property with actual notice of the above facts, and had paid no consideration therefor. The general demurrer and the special exceptions, to the effect that the petition was insufficient to fix upon the city notice of the circumstances under which the deed was taken, because it showed that Hall and Levy, instead of acting as agents of the city, were acting for their own benefit, and adversely to the city, and that the allegation of a past due indebtedness as the sole consideration was insufficient, were sustained by the court, and appellants declined to amend. Appellants alleged, in a supplemental petition, that the city of Sherman made a proposition to the sureties on said bond, that if they would procure from appellants a deed to the property in controversy to said city, that it would accept it in full satisfaction of the debt, and upon this being done the suit on the bond was dismissed. Appellants’ main proposition under the first assignment of error reads as follows: “Two of the aldermen of the city of Sherman participated in the threats by which the deed was secured; the city had beforehand agreed to accept the deed if procured, and the two aldermen were present at the meeting of the city council when the deed was accepted by the city, which was notice to the city of the fact that the deed was procured by the threats. ’ ’ As we understand the allegations in appellants’ pleadings, the two aldermen who were present in the city council when the deed was accepted were interested, with other sureties on the bond of W. E. Harrington, in procuring the deed from said Harrington and wife to said city. The alleged agreement of said city with said sureties to accept the deed and release them from liability on the bond if they would procure it to be made, does not seem to us to establish the relation of principal and agent, but shows rather that the sureties, including the two aldermen, occupied the attitude toward the city of independent contractors. Our conclusion is, that these two aldermen were interested adversely to the city in procuring said deed to be made in order to secure their release from liability on said bond. The fact that they were present in the city council when the deed was accepted would not charge the city with notice of the circumstances under which it was procured. The knowledge of an agent acquired in the transaction of his own private business is not ordinarily imputed to the principal. Kauffman & Runge v. Robey, 60 Texas, 308. As to whether such knowledge is imputed to the principal, if present to the mind of the agent while subsequently engaged in a transaction for the principal, the authorities are conflicting. One of the grounds upon which said knowledge is imputed is, that it is the duty of the agent to •communicate it to the principal. This being the reason of the rule, it is held that the rule does not apply where the agent has a personal interest in a matter which would lead him to conceal his knowledge from his principal, though cases may be found in conflict with this holding. Bank v. Davis, 2 Hill, 451; Bank v. Cushman, 121 Mass., 490; Fairfield v. Bank, 72 Me., 226; Wickersham v. Zinc Co., 18 Kans., 481. Delivered November 1, 1892. . If these two aldermen had been guilty of obtaining the wife’s signature and acknowledgment by means of duress and fraud, as alleged by appellants, it is morally certain that they would not have communicated this knowledge to the city council — the governing body of said city — when said deed was accepted; and we therefore think that their knowledge of the alleged fraud should not be imputed to the city. The second assignment raises the question that the city must be deemed to have had notice, because it parted with no new consideration for the conveyance, but accepted it solely in satisfaction of a pre-existing debt. Were it not for the case of Webb v. Burney, 70 Texas, 322, we would be inclined to sustain this contention of appellants. That case, however, is directly in point, and for that reason alone we hold that this assignment is not well taken; and also, for the same reason, that the third and last assignment is not well taken. It follows from these conclusions that the judgment of the court below"" must be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered. Affirmed. Justice Head did not sit in this case.","W. E. Harrington et al. v. C. H. McFarland et al. No. 19. 1. Agency — Knowledge of Agent not Imputed to Principal, when. — On a defaulting city collector’s official bond, two of the city aldermen, with other persons, were sureties. The board of aldermen proposed to accept, in full settlement of the bond, a deed of the collector’s homestead, worth but little more than half the amount of the default. Such deed was made, and was accepted by the board of aldermen at a meeting at which said two aldermen, members thereof, were present. The collector, joined by his wife, sued to recover the property, alleging that the deed was procured by means of threats, intimidation of the wife, etc., on the part of the two surety aldermen, and a demurrer to the petition was sustained. Meld: 1. The agreement by the city with the sureties to accept such deed if they would procure it, and to thereupon release them on the bond, did not constitute the relation of principal and agent between the city and the sureties, and therefore the presence of the said two aldermen at the meeting of the board when the deed was accepted did not charge the city with notice of the threats, etc., in its procurement. 2. When an agent has a personal interest in a matter adverse to his principal, and which it is to his interest to conceal from his principal, the general rule is that his knowledge in such case will not be imputed to the principal. 2. Notice — Pre-existing Debt — Case Followed. — Under the authority of Webb v. Burney, 70 Texas, 322, it is held that the fact that the sole consideration for the deed to the city was a pre-existing debt, did not charge the city with notice of any irregularity in its procurement. Appeal from Grayson. Tried below before Hon. H. O. Head. Brown & Bliss, for appellants. 1.

Two of the aldermen of the city of Sherman participated in the threats by which the deed was secured; the city had beforehand agreed to accept the deed if procured, and the two aldermen were present at the meeting of the city council when the deed was accepted by the city, which was notice to the city of the fact that the deed was procured by the threats made.

The city of Sherman paid no consideration for the conveyance except the satisfaction of a pre-existing debt, and McFarland paid no consideration at all.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. On the night of August 5, 1888, Edward F. Bond, while in the employ of John C. Brown, receiver of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, as switchman in the yards at Fort Worth, was killed by being run over by the engine upon which he was braking. His death was caused by a pile of loose cinders, which had been unloaded by the track foreman on the day previous to the accident, near one of the rails and a short distance from the switch Bond was required in the discharge of his duty to operate. The cinders being about the color of the ground, and Bond not knowing of their presence near the track, in the performance of his duty stepped off the engine upon which he was riding, on to the cinders, and was thrown under the wheels. The cinders were unloaded as aforesaid for the purpose of being used in repairing the yard. The yard where the injury was caused was used in operating the cars of the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company. Some of the witnesses speak of that part of the yard where the injury was caused as the yards of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, and others say the yard belonged to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company,, but was called the Missouri Pacific yards. The evidence as to the particular relation that each of these companies bore to the yards and to their operation is very unsatisfactory, being confined to the testimony of subordinate employes, who show that the only information they have is such inferences as they dr'ew from the fact that they were paid by one company or the other. It seems that at the immediate time of the injury, both the employes operating the engine and the track foreman who deposited the cinders were paid by the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, or Brown,.its receiver, but only a few weeks previous to this time they had been paid by appellant. Appellee brought this suit to recover under the statute for the death of said Bond against both Brown, receiver, and appellant, alleging joint ownership and operation of the yard, but before the trial she dismissed as to the receiver of the Texas & Pacific, and prosecuted the suit to judgment against appellant alone. The judgment was for 85500 against appellant, from which this appeal is prosecuted. The suit was prosecuted by appellee, who was the surviving wife, for the use of herself and the children of Bond, and the amount recovered was apportioned by the verdict, $4000 to appellee, $1200 to a minor son, and 8100 each to three married daughters. It is well settled by repeated decisions of our Supreme Court since the case of Railway v. Dunham, 49 Texas, 181, that an employe charged by the master with the duty of keeping in repair a railway track is not a fellow servant with the employes operating the train, who sustain injuries through the negligence of such track repairers in the performance of this duty. The death of Bond was caused by the unquestioned negligence of the track foreman in leaving the cinders adjacent to the track the train men were required to pass over in the discharge of their duty at night, and for such negligence the master must be held liable. Where a railroad track or yard is shown to be the property of one company, we think the natural inference, in the absence of evidence, would be that such company is the one that keeps it in repair. Also, if a railway track or yard is shown to be used indiscriminately by two or more companies, in the absence of other evidence explaining the particular nature of the contract between the companies, we think the fair inference would be that they all contribute jointly in keeping it in repair. In this case the evidence shows without contradiction that the cars both of the Texas & Pacific and of the Missouri Pacific Railway Companies were operated in these yards and over the track where the injury occurred, and at the time of the accident deceased was engaged in transferring some cars for appellant as well as the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe. It seems, however, that at this particular time these employes were drawing their pay entirely from the Texas & Pacific, but only a short time before this they had been drawing their pay from the Missouri Pacific. Appellee in her petition charged that the two companies were engaged jointly in operating the yards, and appellant did not upon the trial see proper to introduce in evidence its contract with the other company, but left the jury to draw their inference as to this from"" the testimony of subordinate employes, who expressly state that their only information upon the subject is, that they were paid by one company or the other at the respective times stated by them. The court below in its charge, which is not complained of, required the jury, before finding for appellee, to find that appellant exercised some control in these yards; and after a careful examination of the statement of facts, we are of opinion that the verdict of the jury finding that it did have such control should not be disturbed by us. As the particular nature of this contract was peculiarly within the knowledge of the parties thereto, and could easily have been shown by appellant, we think every presumption should be indulged against it on account of its failure to produce better evidence. Had appellant shown that the yards belonged exclusively to the Texas & Pacific, and that said company alone was charged with the duty of keeping them in repair, and appellant only paid it a consideration for handling its cars in said yard, we do not think it could be held liable to the servants of said company for an injury caused by a defect in the yard; but we are of opinion that the jury was authorized by the evidence to find that such was not the real contract between these companies. Railway v. Dorsey, 66 Texas, 148; Railway v. Jones, 75 Texas, 151. This being an action to recover damages for the pecuniary injury suffered by appellee from the death of Bond, we think the witness J. M. Rogers was properly allowed to state that Bond was kind and affectionate to his family, and that he was an indulgent father and husband. In such cases this evidence is generally admitted as bearing upon the amount of pecuniary benefit the plaintiff might have expected to receive from deceased had he not been killed. At the time Bond was run over by the engine, and while he was still under the wheels, the witness Menshaw came to where he was, and immediately upon his arrival, which was only a few moments after the injury, Bond said to him: “ You know what caused this, Ed. It was the cinders; they gave way as I stepped off the tender and rolled me under the wheels. I did not know that they were there.’ ’ That this was properly admitted as a part of the res geste is now settled by the decisions in this State. Railway v. Anderson, 82 Texas, 516; Railway v. Robertson, 82 Texas, 657; Railway v. Hall, 83 Texas, 675. Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should in all things be affirmed. Affirmed. Delivered January 3, 1893.","The Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. Mary J. Bond. No. 415. 1. Fellow Servant — Railway Company. — An employe charged with' the duty of keeping in repair a railway track, is not a fellow servant with the employes operating the trains who sustain injuries through the negligence of such track repairer in the performance of his duty. 2. Evidence— Presumptions from Failure to Produce.—Two railway companies jointly used the same yards, and one of the companies was sued in damages for a death resulting from negligence in the care of the yards. The defendant company, on the trial, did not offer any evidence of its contract with the other company relative to the use, management, and control of the yards. Held, that as to its control of the yards, every presumption should be indulged against the defendant on account of its failure to produce such evidence; and that proof by employes working in the yards that they were sometimes paid by the one company and sometimes by the other, was sufficient to show that defendant did have a joint control of the yards. 3. Evidence—Action for Death of Husband.—In an action against a railway company for the pecuniary damages caused to plaintiff by the negligent killing of her husband, a witness of plaintiff was properly allowed to state that the husband was kind and affectionate to his family, and was an indulgent father and husband. 4. Same — Res Gestee — Declarations of Deceased. —: The deceased husband, at the time he was run over by the engine, and while he was still under the wheels, made a statement as to the defect in the yards that caused him to fall under the wheels, and that he did not know of such defect. Held, that evidence' of this statement was properly admitted as part of the res gestee. Appeal from Tarrant. Tried below before Hon. R. E. Beckham. Finch & Thomson, for appellant. 1. Appellant is not liable for the-killing of Bond, an employe of another company, merely by reason of its use of the yards of such other company, in which the killing occurred.. Railway v.

Declarations of an injured party, made after an accident has occurred, are not res gestas, nor are they competent evidence as to what caused the injury, in a suit by his representatives for damages resulting from his death.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This action was brought by the appellee, the Lasker Real Estate Association, in the District Court of Galveston County, against James Johnston, for debt and to foreclose certain liens therefor. Appellant M. A. Martin was made a party defendant, as executrix of W. H. Martin, deceased, who had a junior lien. The indebtedness sued on grew out of an indebtedness of the said James Johnston to the First National Bank of Brown wood, which had been transferred to plaintiff by said national bank and one Brooke Smith, the cashier of said bank. It arose in this way: James Johnston bought the lot of land upon which the liens are sought to be foreclosed from Coggin & Parks, and in part payment thereof executed to them his promissory note, with vendor’s lien on the land, for the sum of $465.60, dated October 7, 1884, payable on demand to the order of said Coggin & Parks, with 12 per cent interest per annum from the date of the note until paid, and 10 per cent attorney fee if collected by law. He erected on said lot a two-story stone building. This note Cog-gin & Parks transferred to said Brooke Smith without recourse on them. Afterwards, on March 7, 1885, Johnston executed to William Cameron & Co. his promissory note for $2010, payable to their order on or before December 7, 1885, with 12 per cent interest, and in order to secure the same executed a deed of trust to the defendant W. B. Eskridge upon the lot of land conveyed to him by Coggin & Parks. This note William Cameron & Co. endorsed, without recourse, to said Brooke Smith. On October 17, 1884, the said Johnston, in consideration of borrowed money, executed his note to the First National Bank of Brownwood for the sum of $3000, and in order to indemnify the said Brooke Smith, who signed said note with him as surety, Johnston executed and delivered to said Smith his promissory note of the same date for the sum of $3500, payable on demand after date, waiving grace and protest, to the order of said Smith, with 12 per cent interest and 10 per cent attorney fee, secured by a deed of trust upon the same property. This note was endorsed by the said Brooke Smith, in blank, and delivered by him to the bank as collateral to the said note for $3000. Johnston was then indebted to the bank upon the Coggin & Parks vendor’s lien note, the William Cameron & Co. note, and the $3000 note for which the note and deed of trust for $3500 had been executed as indemnifying security, and in other sums of money not secured by lien. The deed of trust for the $3500 note expressed also a lien on the rents of the Johnston building, in addition to the property itself. For this total indebtedness Johnston executed to the bank his note due at ninety days, which included a discount at the rate of 18 per cent per annum; and at the end of every ninety days a new ninety days note was executed and discounted at the same rate for the total indebtedness then due. The bank collected the rents of the building as they fell due, and applied them to the note then in force representing the aggregate indebtedness, treating and holding the lien notes as collateral security for whatever balance Johnston should owe. On December 30, 1886, there was a balance of $5500 due the bank, which Johnston desired to have extended. Plaintiff agreed to take up the indebtedness and extend time, and Johnston executed and delivered to it a note for the full amount, dated January 1, 1887, payable to the order of plaintiff eighteen months after date, with interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually, in advance, and 10 per cent attorney fee if placed in the hands of an attorney for collection. This note was in accordance with a written agreement, dated December 30, 1886, and recited that the other notes were held by and hypothecated to plaintiff as collateral security for its payment. Plaintiff paid the indebtedness to the bank, and the bank and Brooke Smith, by an agreement in writing, transferred the above described lien notes to plaintiff, reciting that there was yet due on the Coggin & Parks note $400, on the Cameron note $2000, and on the Brooke Smith $3500 note $3100, making a total of $5500, and warranted that said amounts were the true amounts due and unpaid, and that the liens had never been released; but as to further liability without recourse. To the above mentioned agreement was annexed an agreement by Johnston, recognizing the validity of the notes and the liens to secure them, and in consideration of the extension of time, that he would keep the property insured, pay principal and interest in Galveston, and waived the statute of limitations. The junior lien of appellant M. A. Martin’s testator, W. H. Martin, was a deed of trust executed upon the same and other property, June 24, 1885, to secure the note of said Johnston of that date for $6295.45, and conveyed the property to the defendant Henry Ford as trustee, ‘‘ subject, however, to a lien in favor of said First National Bank for about $3500,. and another lien in favor of William Cameron for about $2025.” Plaintiff in its petition set out the several lien notes and the facts leading to the execution of the note for $5500, which, it averred, was given to evidence in brief form the terms of the agreement dated December 30, 1886, and was for the same indebtedness and none other than that evidenced by the three promissory notes above described. Mrs. Martin pleaded as a defense against said notes the statute of limitations and usury. As a junior encumbrancer of the lands, she could avail herself of, and set up as against the indebtedness sued on, whatever ■defense Johnston, the maker of the notes, had, although he was a party to the suit and suffered judgment by default. Arledge v. Hail, 54 Texas, 401; Burks v. Watson, 48 Texas, 110. If the limitation had run against the .lien notes, Mrs. Martin could have availed herself of it and pleaded it in bar of a recovery; but the agreement of December 30, 1886, made' by Johnston with the Lasker Real Estate Association for the purpose of having his debt to the bank taken up, acknowledged the validity of the three notes and agreed to pay them, waiving the statute of limitations. This agreement was made after the deed of trust in favor of W. H. Martin had been executed and recorded, and the question arises whether Johnston, by a promise made subsequent to his act creating the junior encumbrance on the lot, could renew his obligation on the notes so as to deprive the junior encumbrancer of the defense of limitation. That he could, was the effect of the decision in Ware v. Bennett, 18 Texas, 794. Such is also the great weight of authority. Wood on Lim., sec. 230, and note 2; Ang. on Lim., sec. 460; Heyer v. Pruyn, 7 Paige, 465; Hughes v. Edwards, 9 Wheat., 497. It is also competent for the mortgagor to arrange for an extension of the mortgage debt, and an agreement to extend the time of payment will not discharge the lien of the mortgage as to subsequent encumbrancers. Whittacre v. Fuller, 5 Minn., 508. It was shown by the evidence, that the balance of indebtedness taken up by the plaintiff, and for which Johnston executed his note for $5500, was ascertained after the application of the rents of the building, which were collected by the bank, to the payment of usurious interest. Mrs. Martin p'eaded usury, and contends that all interest should be forfeited, and the rents should be applied to the principal of the lien notes; first, to the note for the amount of indebtedness represented by the $3500 note and deed of trust, which was also a lien on the rents, and then to the other notes. There are many authorities which hold that usury is a defense so strictly personal that a third party can not avail himself thereof; but it seems that 11 the doctrine more generally adopted is, that not only the mortgagor, but any person who is seized of his estate and vested with his rights, unless he has assumed the payment of the mortgage, may interpose this defense, although a mere stranger can not.” 1 Jones on Mort., sec. 644. A junior mortgagee may set up usury in the mortgage. Id., and authorities cited in note 9. When a purchaser of the equity of redemption assumes the payment of the mortgage, it becomes a part of the consideration paid for the land, and it is immaterial with such purchaser whether there is usury in the mortgage or not. The language used in the Martin deed of trust, that it is taken subject to the liens in favor of the Brooke Smith and Cameron & Co. notes, is nothing more than a mere acknowledgment of notice of these liens, and does not affect the holder of the Martin encumbrance with any obligation not to set up any lawful defense which Johnston himself may have then had or subsequently acquired to the notes. We do not think, however, that the Coggin & Parks vendor’s lien note nor the William Cameron & Co. note were tainted with usury. It was only subsequently to their execution, and after they had been transferred to the bank, that the question of usury arises, and then usurious interest was paid and taken upon sums represented by them as the amounts paid for them. With reference to the amounts represented by these notes, we do not think the entire amount of interest should be forfeited; only the excess of interest over the amount called for in their face should be credited on the principal. The note for $3500 was executed to indemnify the said Brooke Smith as an endorser of a note executed by the said Johnston to the bank for §3000. As the creditor of Johnston, with Smith as security, the bank was entitled to whatever security Smith had, and when Smith endorsed the note for $3500 to the bank, it became in the hands of the bank merely collateral security for the note of Johnston to the bank for $3000. The latter note was discounted to the bank for $2865, being at the rate of 18 per cent per annum, a rate which was usurious, so the contract was a usurious contract. All payments of interest on this note, whether by way of discount or otherwise, should be applied to the principal thereof, including the first discount. In the judgment below the court seems to have only allowed the excess of interest as a credit on the principal, which was error. As a new note was executed every ninety •days for the aggregate indebtedness, and discounted afresh, it follows that there should be quarterly rests in the computation of the interest, so as to ascertain the amounts to be credited, and we are not in the possession of sufficient data to enable us to arrive at the amount. It may be that the books of the bank will show the actual amounts received as interest. Johnston remained in the possession of the property, and in addition to the payment of interest applied the rents to the extinction of his unsecured indebtedness. Appellant contends, that as the deed of trust for the $3500 note was also a lien on the rents, they should have been applied entirely to the extinction of the lien. This seems to be otherwise. 1 Jones on Mort., sec. 670. Johnston remained in possession of the rents as of the other property included in the deed of trust, and had the right of disposition thereof until possession was taken under the deed of trust. But when the receiver was appointed and the property taken charge of by the court, the rents should then have been applied at least to the ex-tinguishment of the lien on the property and rents to secure the note for $3500; hence the court erred in adjudging that the rents accumulated and to accumulate in the hands of the receiver after his appointment should be applied to the payment of that portion of the plaintiff’s judgment which had been postponed to the appellants’ lien. We do not think that it is necessary to notice the eighth and ninth assignments of error, for the reason that no such affirmative relief was properly sought, even if there should be no other reason. The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded for another trial in accordance with the opinion herein expressed. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 26, 1893.","James Johnston et al. v. The Lasker Real Estate Association. No. 82. 1. Defense of Usury made by Junior Encumbrancer.—A bank held' notes secured by lien upon realty. Appellant Martin held a junior lien, dated June 25, 1885. In December, 1885, the debtor, Johnston, executed to the bank one note for his total indebtedness to it, due at ninety days., which included a discount of eighteen per cent, and at the end of every ninety days a new note was executed and discounted at the same rate, the lien notes being held by it as collateral security. Desiring further extension, on January 1,1887, Johnston executed a new note to plaintiff, bearing 12 per cent interest, payable eighteen months after date, and reciting that the other notes were held by and hypothecated to plaintiff as collateral security for its payment. Plaintiff paid Johnston’s indebtedness to the bank, and the lien notes were by the bank transferred to plaintiff. By agreement annexed, Johnston recognized the validity of the lien notes, and waived the statute of limitation. Mrs. Martin pleaded as a defense against the elder lien notes, usury. As a junior encumbrancer she could avail herself of whatever defense Johnston had, although he was a party to the suit and suffered judgment by default. 2. Limitation Waived, Effect of.—The agreement of December 30,1886, made by Johnston with plaintiff, acknowledged the validity of the three lien notes, and promised to pay them, waiving the statute of limitations; and though it was-a promise made by him subsequent to the execution of the junior encumbrance, the weight of authority is, that he had the right to waive limitation, though it would deprive the junior encumbrancer of the defense of limitation. 3. Extension of Senior Mortgage Debt.—It was also competent for the mortgagor to arrange for an extension of the time of payment of the senior mortgage debt, and such an agreement to extend the time will not discharge the lien of the mortgage as to subsequent encumbrancers. 4. Amount Forfeited for Usury.—Two of the elder lien notes were not tainted with usury when made; it was only after they were transferred to the bank that the question of usury arises. As to the amounts represented by these notes, the entire interest should not be forfeited, but only the excess of interest over the amount of interest called for by their face. 5. Same.—The $3500 note was discounted to the bank for $2865, being at the rate of 18 per cent per annum, and the contract was usurious, and all payments of interest on this note, whether by way of discount or otherwise, should be applied to the principal thereof, including the first discount; and as a new note was executed every ninety days for the aggregate indebtedness and discounted afresh,.there should be quarterly rests in the computation of the interest to ascertain the amounts to be credited. 6. Renta Under Lien, How Applied.—The rents of Johnston’s building were also mortgaged to secure the senior debts; but he remained in possession of the property, and applied the rents to the payment of his unsecured indebtedness. This he might do, as he was in possession and had the right of disposition thereof until possession was taken under the deed of trust; but after a receiver was appointed the rents should have been applied to the extinguishment of the lien on the property and rents. ON MOTION EOR REHEARING. 7. Liabilities of Parties Fixed.—Upon re-examination found, that there is sufficient data by which to arrive at the amount that should be credited on the several notes for payments thereon of usurious interest. These amounts are stated, the liabilities of each of the parties fixed, and judgment here rendered, without prejudice to the right of Mrs. Martin, by proper proceeding, to have rents accumulated in the hands of the receiver applied to the satisfaction of that portion of this judgment adjudged to be a superior lien to hers. Appeal from Galveston. Tried below before Hon. W. H. Stewart. W. B. Lockhart and John W. Goodwin, for appellant, Mrs. Martin. 1. No right of action can be maintained for a debt nor foreclosure had of liens given to secure the same, in the courts, when the debt is barred by the statute of limitation. Fievel v. Zuber, 67 Texas, 275; Goldfrank v. Young, 64 Texas, 432. 2. No admission of the debt, no account or contract, by the debtor or mortgagor subsequent to the junior mortgage or trust deed, duly recorded, could have any force or effect whatever against the latter, nor extend limitation. Gillum v. Collier & Richardson, 53 Texas, 592; Wofford v. Unger, 55 Texas, 480; Trust Co. v. Coreit, 29 Barb., 435; Schumacker v. Sibert, 18 Kans., 104; Larthel v. Hogan, 1 La. Ann., 330; Lord v. Morris, 18 Cal., 490. 3. Mrs. Martin has a right to plead any substantial defense that could have been pleaded by Johnston. Arledge v. Hall, 54 Texas, 402; Burks v. Watson, 48 Texas, 107. 4. The junior mortgagee, in relation to the prior mortgagee, holds the property in the light of a surety, and is entitled to all the rights and'protection of a surety as to such property; and therefore the extension of the notes by the Lasker Real Estate Association, granting even that it was a valid holder of them, discharged their liens upon the Johnston property as to this executrix. Ins. Co. v. Turnley, 61 Texas, 370; Bayl. on Sure., 490-494; Kyle v. Davis, 20 Wis., 568; Leston v. Picketts, 24 Wis., 346; Niemcewiz v. Cohn, 3 Paige, 641; Avenil v. Taylor, 4 Seld., 51; Haberton v. Bennett, Beat. Ch., 386; Will. Eq. Jur., 113. 5. The agreement of plaintiff and James Johnston, evidenced by the promissory note of Johnston to plaintiff for $5500, dated January 1,1887, in which Johnston hypothecates with plaintiff, as collateral to secure his indebtedness to it, the three promissory notes upon which plaintiff is endeavoring to recover in this action, having been executed subsequent to and as a consummation of all their prior negotiations, it must be conclusively presumed, as to a subsequent valid lien holder, that the notes had therefore been paid by or for Johnston, and that the transaction as between him and plaintiff was a renewal only of the notes and their liens for the purposes of the hypothecation, and Johnston and plaintiff had then no power whatever to deprive this executrix, whose rights had accrued, of the full legal effect of such payment.

The court did not err in foreclosing the lien on the Johnston building for the balance due on the notes mentioned in these assignments of error, because said notes were not barred by limitation at the date of the institution of this suit, nor were the debts and lien invalid against said appellant Mrs. Mary A. Martin, executrix. Ware v. Bennett, 18 Texas, 794; Trotter v. Hughes, 62 Am. Dec., 137; Klapworth v. Dressler, 78 Am. Dec., 69, and notes on 73, 75, 78, 84, 86-88; Belmont v. Coman, 78 Am. Dec., 213, and notes; Ross v. Worthington, 88 Am. Dec., 95; Abell v. Coons, 68 Am. Dec., 229; Burr v. Beers, 80 Am. Dec., 327. 2. The rents of the building were a fund upon which said appellant had no lien, and in which she had no interest or estate; and so far as they were concerned, the debtor, Johnston, could dispose of them as he pleased, and even give them away, in the absence of fraud as to creditors generally, and knowledge thereof and participation therein by this appellee. 3. The plea of usury, upon which alone the application of the rents as actually made by Johnston, the bank, and Brooke Smith can be set aside and revised, was a personal privilege of Johnston, who alone was interested therein; and appellant Mrs. Martin, having no interest therein, was not entitled to have such application revised or corrected as against the appellee, who was no party to the usurious transaction complained of, nor cognizant thereof. 4. Though for part of the debt the bank had a lien on the rents as well as the corpus of the property, it was competent for the bank to waive this lien, and by agreement with Johnston, the only other party interested therein, to apply them otherwise, as they were in fact applied to other indebtedness owing by Johnston to the bank, as well as to interest, usurious though it may have been.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. Mrs. Foster, plaintiff in error, sued the New York and Texas Land Company, limited, to enforce specific performance of an alleged written contract to convey three sections of land in Galveston County, and joined C. E. Angelí as defendant, averring that he had made a contract to purchase the lands from his codefendant subsequent to the agreement sued on, and with notice of its having been entered into. Prayer was made for specific performance and cancellation of Angelí’s contract; and in the event that for any reason this relief could not be had, plaintiff recover as damages the value of the three sections of land. The cause was tried before a jury, and a verdict and judgment rendered for defendants; and a motion for a new trial being overruled, plaintiff made one assignment of error, and has brought the case here by writ of error. No questions are raised upon the pleadings, and it is unnecessary to state them. The documentary evidence offered by plaintiff to establish the contract the enforcement of which is sought consisted of the following letters and telegrams. P. Whitty was the local agent of the land company at Houston, for certain purposes. Ira H. Evans was its president and A. B. Langerman its chief clerk. [No. 1.] “Houston, Texas, December 20, 1889. 1 ‘ Ira II. Evans, Esq., President, Austin, Texas: 1 ‘ Dear Sir—Mrs. Corra Bacon Foster, real estate agent of this city,, makes an offer of $2.90 per acre for the unsold portion of the Alvin land, one-fifth cash, the balance in four years, four annual payments, with 8 per cent interest. I told her I would mention the offer, but I did not think you would entertain one less than some advance on $3 per acre for the whole. I think there is some one in Galveston that has gotten her to give an offer. I think I can at least net $10 per acre cut up, even if it should take two or three years to do it. “ Yours truly, “ P. Whitty.” [No. 2.] “Austin, Texas, December 23, 1889. “P. Whitty, Esq., Houston, Texas: “Dear Sir—Your favor of the 20th instant to hand. Major Evans left the city for a trip North, and is not expected to return before the first of the year, and we had better postpone the matter of Mrs. Corra Bacon Foster until his return. We certainly will not sell for less than S3 per acre, if we sell at all around Alvin for the present. “ Yours truly, [Signed] “ A. B. Langerman, Chief Clerk.” [No. 2a.] “Austin, Texas, December 23, 1889. “P. Whitty, Esq., Houston, Texas: “ Dear Sir—I am just advised by Major Evans that he is willing to take S3 per acre for Galveston County lands, on terms proposed by Mrs. Corra Bacon Foster—that is, one-fifth cash, balance in four equal annual payments, with 8 per cent interest per annum. “Yours truly, [Signed] “ A. B. Langerman, Chief Clerk.” [Copy of Telegram.] “ Houston, Texas, December 27, 1889. “ To A. B. Langerman, Chief Clerk New York and Texas Land Company, Austin: “ Mrs. Foster will take the land, agreeable to your terms. Letter by mail. “ P. Whitty.” These are papers which, in connection with paroi evidence offered, are claimed by plaintiff in error to form a complete contract for the sale of twenty-five sections of land, including the three sections in controversy, situated in Galveston County, in the neighborhood of the town of Alvin. Other correspondence, consisting of other letters and telegrams immediately following the above, were also offered by plaintiff, as follows: “Houston, Texas, December 27, 1889. “A. B. Langerman, Esq., Chief Clerk, Austin, Texas: “ Dear Sir—I wired you this a. m. that Mrs. Corra Bacon Foster is willing to take the Alvin land on the terms indicated in your letter of the 23d instant, which I handed her to read. She wishes a sketch of it prepared, to be attached to the contract, and intimates that she will have her first payment ready in about a week from now; that is, she wants to take a few days to satisfy herself about the title. I told her that Mr. Masterson, of Galveston, had satisfied Mr. Angelí on the subject of title, and that she could no doubt get all required information from him on that subject. “Yours, “ P. Whitty.” To which Evans replied as follows: “Austin, Texas, December 28, 1889. “ Mr. P. Whitty, 19 Main Street, Houston, Texas: “ Dear Sir—Your favor of 27th instant, advising me that Mrs. Corra Bacon Foster is willing to take our Alvin land at $3 per acre, on terms stated in your letter of the 23d, came to hand. Before closing this contract, we would like to have Mr. Giraud""s survey made, and I write to him to-day. I hope we can have him go down there after New Year. This will also give Mrs. Foster time to have our title investigated. As she wishes to cut up the land into small tracts, we can not afford to make the contract before we know just how our lands lie. “Yours truly, [Signed] “Ira H. Evans, President.” January 2, 1890, Whitty wrote Evans as follows: “Houston, January 2, 1890. 1 Ira H. Phans, Esq., President, Austin, Texas: “ Dear Sir—Will you kindly wire Mr. Giraud to come down as soon as possible. It is quite an object to Mrs. F. to get the land on the market as soon as possible. Should there be much delay on our part, the Alvin boom may die out, causing her to change her mind. “ Yours truly, “ P. Whitty.” To which Evans replied: “ Austin, Texas, January 3, 1890. uMr. P. Whitty, Houston, Texas: “ Dear Sir—Your favor of the 2d instant, urging the necessity of Mr. Giraud doing the work in Galveston County as soon as possible, came to hand. I write him to-day, and expect he will be able to go down to do this work early next week. ‘1 Yours truly, [Signed] “Ira H. Evans,President. February 3, 1890, Whitty wrote as follows: “ Houston, February 3, 1890. “Ira H. Evans, Esq., President: “ Dear Sir—Replying to yours of the 1st instant, I called to see Mrs. Foster yesterday, to tell her that I am having other inquiries about the Alvin land, and that the party to whom I had already sold, Mr. Angelí, wanted three sections more. I also told her that I had been to Galveston with some of the papers, and that all the field notes and maps would be ready in a few days. I wanted to see if she was still in the notion of buying. She says she is fully determined to make the purchase. She has a full abstract of the title, and her lawyer pronounced it all right. “ Yours truly, “P. Whitty.” To which Evans replied: “Austin, Texas, February 3, 1890. “Mr. P. Whitty, Houston, Texas: “ Dear Sir—Your favor of the 3d instant, advising me that Mrs. Foster is still anxious to purchase some of our land in Galveston County, came to hand. I wish you would push her to close this trade, if you can possibly do so, and also advise me what lands she wants to buy. It is my understanding that she desires to purchase the land off the west end of our block, at or near Alvin. “As you are aware, Mr. C. E. Angelí has purchased surveys 16, 17, 19, and 20. He will also soon close the trade for survey 18, and probably purchase in addition surveys 14, 15, and 21. “ Please advise me as soon as you can what Mrs. Foster will do. “ Yours truly, [Signed] “ Ira H. Evans, President. “ P. S.—If Mrs. Foster will not immediately close her trade, is it not possible to get an advance over §3 per acre on these lands ? [Signed] “I. H. E.” February 4, 1890, Whitty wrote as follows: “ Houston, Texas, February 4, 1890. “Ira H. Evans, Esq., President: “ Dear Sir—Yours of the 3d instant at hand and contents noted. Just as soon as you have contract and sketch ready for Mrs. Foster, I will push her to close. “ If there is a chance of much further delay in fixing the maps and field notes, it might be well to ask her to deposit her first payment subject to your order on delivery of the papers; but as it has gone so far now, it may be as well to wait and draw upon her through the bank as soon as the papers are there. I notice that she has advertised in last Sunday’s ‘Post’ 12,000 acres of land at Alvin, at S6 per acre. Mr. Giraud will give you an idea of the character of the Alvin land. God only knows how it may be made habitable. Nevertheless, I think if we don’t close it out at once to Mrs. Foster and Angelí, we can sell it before the end of this year at an advance. “Yours truly, “P. Whitty.” To which Evans replied: “Austin, Texas, February 5, 1890. ""Mr. P. Whitty, Houston, Texas: “ Dear Sir—Replying to your favor of yesterday, I have to say, that we expect to be able to send you corrected field notes by the close of this week for all surveys in Galveston County requiring correction. ‘ ‘ Upon return of these field notes, properly signed, we shall be prepared to furnish Mrs. Foster a sketch, by which she can purchase any oi these surveys she may desire to obtain. “I should not care to have her make a deposit, or to draw a draft upon her through the bank on account of this business, inasmuch as we expect to be prepared so soon to act definitely upon the matter. “In view of this strawberry boom, it begins to look as if we need not be in any very great haste to push the sale of this land. What do you think of the chance of getting better prices for it ? “Your remark with respect to this land, ‘ God only knows how it may be made habitable,’ occasions me no little surprise, in view of the fact that when you were proposing to subdivide, you recommended me to buy some of it for a country residence. Will you kindly explain ? “ Yours truly, [Signed] “ Ira H. Evans, President. Subsequently the following correspondence took place: “Austin, Texas, February 22, 1890. “P. Whitty, Houston, Texas: “ Ready to make contract. Describe property and terms wanted. [Signed] “ Ira H. Evans.” “ Houston, February 22, 1890. ""Ira H. Evans, Austin, Texas: “ Mrs. Foster’s offer, which you have, is for all the Galveston County land outside the Angelí purchase. ‘ ‘ Yours, P Whitty.” “Austin, Texas, February 26, 1890. “P. Whitty, Houston, Texas: “ Mrs. Foster must decide immediately about Galveston lands. Angelí wants more. See her, and wire me. [Signed] ‘ ‘ Ira H. Evans.’ ’ “Austin, Texas, February 26, 1890. “P. Whitty, Houston, Texas: “ Can not do anything different with Mrs. Foster either as to terms or amount of land. Must know immediately if she will close trade on contract sent you. Your letter received. [Signed] “ Ira H. Evans.” “Austin, Texas, February 26, 1890. “P. Whitty, Houston, Texas: “ Wish you to come up with Mrs. Foster without any failure. [Signed] ‘1 Ira H. Evans.’ ’ The plaintiff read in evidence the depositions of Evans and Whitty, setting out the above correspondence, and stating the history of the negotiations and of the sale of the three sections in controversy to Angelí, and the subsequent conveyance of the remaining twenty-two sections to plaintiff. Plaintiff was then about to proceed further with the introduction of oral testimony, when the trial judge inquired if plaintiff had any more documentary evidence tending to show the existence of the contract; and on being informed in the negative, instructed the jury to find for defendant, plaintiff offering to show by paroi evidence other facts stated in her bill of exceptions. The substance of the paroi evidence thus introduced and offered by plaintiff, as far as its statement affects our decision, can be more conveniently given in connection with the several points discussed. It is claimed by plaintiff, that by the letters which passed between Whitty and Langerman of date December 20, December 23, and the telegram of December 27, 1889, with the legitimate paroi evidence introduced and offered, a complete and binding contract is shown for the sale of all of the twenty-five sections of land. The defendants, on the other hand, contend that the transaction lacks many of the essential qualities of a valid contract for the sale of land, and amount to nothing more than a negotiation. We think the case may be disposed of by an answer to the question, Was there a distinct offer in writing on one side to sell absolutely, and on the other an unconditional acceptance, sufficient to meet the requirements of the law ? It may, for the present, be conceded that Langerman’s second letter to Whitty of December 23, 1889, contains an offer to sell the land in controversy sufficient, if properly accepted, to make a binding contract. The first question which then arises is, Must such acceptance have been in writing ? There is no pretense that Mrs. Foster did accept in writing. Whether an oral acceptance of such an offer is sufficient, is a question about which there is elsewhere a conflict of authority. The weight of authority is said by elementary writers to be in favor of the affirmative, but it is admitted that there is strong reason and high authority to sustain the opposite view. We consider that we are concluded by the decision of the Supreme Court of this State in Patton v. Sucker, 29 Texas, 402-408, where it is said: “ In order to their enforcement by the courts, contracts for the sale of lands must be evidenced by writing. Where the writing relied on contains within itself all the particulars of a concluded contract, it is sufficient, if it be signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced; but if, instead of being evidence of a concluded agreement, whatever may be its form, it is really a mere proposal, such a writing is turned into an agreement, and can be enforced in equity by the other party only by his acceptance of it in writing.” This is not in conflict with nor modified by the decisions in the cases of Crutchfield v. Donathon, 49 Texas, 695, and Watson v. Baker, 71 Texas, 747. The first case was a suit on a note which was a contract complete in itself; and in the last, the offer and acceptance were both in writing. So that the question herein involved was neither, presented nor discussed. These, and the case of Morris v. Gaines, 82 Texas, 255, are based upon facts which show either a writing signed by the party to be charged, evidencing an undertaking complete in itself and not dependent on a subsequent acceptance to conclude the contract, or else an offer made and accepted in writing. There was no complete contract in this case without acceptance of the offer. The decision in Patten v. Bucker holds, that in such cases the acceptance must be in writing in order to complete the contract. That case involved a discussion and decision of the question, for there was a verbal acceptance of the offer to sell conclusively shown. The court virtually held that insufficient, and then decided that the writing relied on was sufficient. We do not think that the passage which we have quoted can be treated by us as a mere dictum. But there is a further objection to the alleged acceptance in this case. There was no offer to show that Whitty had any authority to bind the company, and there was positive evidence that he had none. An acceptanee, to bind the company, must therefore have been communicated to those officers who had such authority. The telegram relied on from Whitty to Langerman stated that plaintiff would take the land, agreeably to proposed terms, but referred to a letter, evidently for fuller expression. That letter repeated the statement, that plaintiff was willing to take the land, but added that she wished a sketch of it prepared, to be attached to the contract, and that she would have her first payment ready in about a week; “that is, she wants to take a few days to satisfy herself about the title.” The letter and telegram must be taken together, and must evidence an unconditional acceptance of the offer. Instead of that, they seem to suggest a modification of the terms of the trade, in asking time in which to make a payment which was to be made in cash, and in which to satisfy herself of the soundness of the title. See Corcoran v. White, 117 Ill., 118. An acceptance, to complete a contract, must be the unconditional and absolute agreement to the very terms of the offer. This letter suggested modifications which necessitated further negotiations and further agreements. This is rendered evident by the reply of the company to this letter, in which the following language occurs: “Before closing this contract, we would like to have Mr. G-iraud’s survey made, and I write to him to-day. I hope we can have him go down there after New Tear. This will also give Mrs. Foster time to have our title investigated. As she wishes to cut up the land into small tracts, we can not afford to make the contract before we know just how our lands lie.” It appears from the correspondence, that the completion of the contract was deferred on both sides. Mrs. Foster, according to Whitty’s letter, asks for time to satisfy herself about the title, and the company wants to have a survey made before making the contract. It seems to us that the parties up to this point were negotiating, and that their minds did not meet in a binding contract, on the part of the seller to sell, and the buyer to buy, in presentí and unconditionally. The expressions used indicate that they intended to close the trade by a full contract when the necessary preliminaries were settled. The expression of willingness on the part of Mrs. Foster to take the land may be interpreted, in connection with all the letter contains, to mean that she was willing to so take it when she should have satisfied herself of the title and prepared herself to make the first payment. The company was authorized to put that interpretation on it, and evidently did so. The obstacle here presented to plaintiff’s right to recover is not merely that she did not perform the contract, but that she did not accede to the proposition in a binding way. The plaintiff, after having introduced these letters in evidence, offered to show, that in her conversation with Whitty she stated that she accepted the offer unconditionally, and did not authorize Whitty or any one to change it, and that knowledge of her acceptance in this manner was brought home to defendant company immediately thereafter. But there was no claim that any other communication was made to the company than the written ones in evidence. But it was stated that there was no other documentary evidence. If there was any evidence in the possession of plaintiff showing such communication, it should, in view of all that had been offered, have been specifically pointed out to the court. Plaintiff further offered to show on this point, 11 that the defendant company, with the knowledge brought home to its officers at Austin, permitted the plaintiff Mrs. Foster to go ahead and sell portions of the land as belonging to her under this contract, and that she actually made such contracts for sale. That in pursuance of this contract of sale the defendant company ordered a survey of the land to be made, in order to ascertain the exact number of acres embraced in the contract, and for which plaintiff was to pay S3 per acre. * * * That until the completion of the survey and the tender to Mrs. Foster on the 27th day of February, 1890, of the instrument described in appendix B, the defendant company permitted Mrs. Foster to believe that she had contracted for and was to have all the unsold land referred to in the said correspondence, the same embracing the twenty-five sections of land set forth in the exhibit attached to plaintiff’s petition.” On this point the defendant’s agent, Whitty, testified: “ I handed the letter to Mrs. Foster at the time [referring to the letter No. 2a above]. She stated that she would take the lands on those terms. Nothing was said as to when the first payment was to be made. She came around several times to make inquiries about the land, and as to when the surveys would be completed and when ready. I never told her that any of the twenty-five sections had been sold, because I did not know that any of them had been sold.” It is contended by plaintiff in error, that these facts were sufficient to show, not only that she had accepted, but that the company knew and recognized the fact, and that this cured any ambiguity which there might have been in the letter as to acceptance. No act of the company is here stated by which permission to sell was given to plaintiff. What it did and what plaintiff did, as represented in the bill of exceptions, is consistent with the contention of either party, and adds nothing to the effect of the alleged acceptance in the telegram and letter. Our conclusion from the evidence introduced is, that the minds of the parties never in fact met in an agreement to buy and sell, but that the transactions were negotiations, through which they were putting themselves in a condition to conclude a contract. The evidence offered was not sufficient to change this construction, and the court did not err in instructing a verdict for defendants. It is therefore unnecessary to decide the numerous other questions raised. Affirmed. Delivered March 9, 1893. A writ of error was refused in this case by the Supreme Court, May 15, 1893.","Corra B. Foster v. The New York and Texas Land Company. No. 94. 1. Acceptance of Written Offer to Sell Land Must be in Writing.—Plaintiff proposed to buy certain land. Defendant answered that he would sell on terms proposed. Plaintiff to that replied that she would take the land, but wanted a sketch of it prepared to be attached to the contract, and time to investigate title; and defendant replied that before closing the contract he wanted a survey made. There is no pretense that plaintiff accepted in writing, and the acceptance of such an offer to sell land must be in writing. 2. Same—Case Followed.—Where the writing relied on contains within itself all the particulars of a concluded contract, it is sufficient if it be signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced; but if instead of being evidence of a concluded agreement, whatever its form, it is really a mere proposal, such writing is turned into an agreement, and can be enforced in equity by the other party only by his acceptance of it in writing. Following Patton v. Rucker, 29 Texas, 402. 3. Acceptance Must be Unconditional.—An acceptance, to complete a contract, must be the unconditional and absolute agreement to the very terms of the offer. The letter sent to the defendant, on behalf of the plaintiff, suggested modifications, which necessitated further negotiations and further agreements. It appears from the correspondence, that the completion of the contract was deferred on both sides; and plaintiff not having acceded to the proposition in a binding way, and the minds of the contracting parties having never in fact met in an agreement to buy and sell, plaintiff can not recover. 4. Parol Evidence to Show Acceptance. —Plaintiff offered to show, that defendant permitted the plaintiff to sell parts of the land under this contract, that they had a survey made to ascertain the exact number of acres in the twenty-five sections contracted for, and allowed plaintiff to believe that she was to have all of the land. These facts add nothing to the effect of the acceptance claimed to be shown by the telegrams and letters. Error from Galveston. Tried below before Hon. Wm. H. Stewart. Goldthwaite, Ewing & H. F.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This suit was brought for damages resulting to appellees from overcrowding their cattle in cars furnished by appellant for shipment from Harrold, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois, as well as for the loss of some that escaped in loading. One Chatham, as agent for appellees, accompanied the cattle shipped as aforesaid, and testified as to the injuries received by the cattle; and that he was acquainted with the market value of said cattle at Chicago when delivered; and that he had been engaged in the business of handling and shipping cattle for several years, and knew the condition of said cattle at the time they were shipped and at the time they arrived at Chicago. Whereupon appellees requested him to state what the damage per head to said cattle was on arrival at Chicago; to which appellant objected, on the ground that the question called for a conclusion of the witness; which objection being overruled, the following answer was made: “ In my opinion all said cattle were damaged §5 per head.” Appellant having reserved a bill of exceptions to the introduction of this testimony, assigns its admission as error. This question was passed upon by us in the case of Railway v. Wright, 1 Texas Civil Appeals, 402. On the authority of that case and the cases therein cited, we must hold this assignment to be well taken. The other assignments contained in appellant’s brief, to-wit, the fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth, are believed to be without merit. As the illegal testimony was of a material character, and we can not say that it did not influence the verdict of the jury, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.

"STEPHENS, Associate Justice. This is the suit of a landlord against his tenant to recover rents and the value of supplies, etc., in the total sum of $362.65. The crop was seized under a distress warrant and replevied by the tenant.. In his answer he set up certain offsets, and also pleaded in reconvention for damages. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the landlord for $36.35, upon which the court entered judgment in favor of the landlord for that amount, but, without stating any reason for so doing, adjudged the costs against him. From this judgment O. Gr. Denson, the landlord, has appealed. By the second assignment of errors, he complains of the judgment of the court, in that the costs of the suit were adjudged against him, and asks that on this ground the judgment be reversed and rendered. Our conclusion is, that inasmuch as he was successful in the suit to the extent of the amount recovered, and as his demand was reduced to an amount which would not have been within the jurisdiction of the court,. by a counter-claim and not by payment, no payment even being alleged, that he should have recovered his costs. Rev. Stats., art. 1421, 1428. It is true that article 1434 provides, that the court may, for good cause, to be stated on the record, adjudge the costs otherwise than as provided in the preceding articles of the chapter. The court does not seem to have proceeded under this article, as no reason is stated for adjudging the costs against appellant; and we see no good reason why the costs were not adjudged against appellee and the sureties on his replevy bond, as provided in article 3117. There is another assignment, which calls in question the correctness of the court’s ruling in excluding testimony, but if this assignment should be sustained, it would lead not only to a reversal of the judgment, but also to a remanding of the cause, which is requested by appellant only in the event he can not have the judgment reversed and rendered. The judgment will therefore be reversed and here rendered for appellant against appellee and the sureties on his replevy bond for the amount recovered below, with costs. Reversed and rendered.

Costs Wrongly Adjudged Against Successful Party.—Where the plaintiff recovers judgment for an amount that would not have been within the-jurisdiction of the court, his demand having been reduced on the trial by counterclaim, and not by payment, it is error in the court, without cause therefor stated on the record, to adjudge against-him the costs of the suit.

"HEAD, Associate Justice. This writ of error is prosecuted to reverse a judgment by default rendered on the 19th of May, 1883, in favor of defendant in error against Mollie Shockley, for the sum of @441.71, and foreclosing the vendor’s lien on block 42 in the city of Denison. The original petition in the case in which the judgment was rendered alleged, that on the 17th of January, 1877, L. ""W"". Carlton and Mollie Carlton, his wife, executed the note sued on, since which L. W. Carleton has died, leaving surviving him his said wife and three minor children whose given names were unknown to plaintiff, but all of whom resided in Grayson County, Texas; that L. W. Carleton died intestate, and there had been no administration on his estate. This petition contains no distinct averment that the note sued on was given for the land upon which the lien was foreclosed, but the note was copied in the petition, and it recited this fact, and also that it was secured by a deed of trust on said property; and the prayer of the petition was for judgment for the debt, interest, and costs, and for a foreclosure of his lien upon said land, and for general and special relief. The citation commanded the sheriff to summon Mollie Carlton,Carlton,-- Carlton, and-Carlton. The return on the citation shows that it was executed on the 11th day of February, 1882, by delivering to Curtis A. Carlton, Bosa Carlton, Ernest Carlton, and Mollie Carlton, alias Mollie Shockley, each in person, a true copy of the citation. On September 12, 1882, the case seems to have been dismissed by the court upon its own motion, for want of prosecution. On December 20, 1882, and at the same term of the court at which the dismissal was had, the court, upon motion of the plaintiff, without notice to the defendants, reinstated the case. On March 5, 1883, defendant in error file'd an amended original petition, alleging the loss of the note by his attorney, and that since the institution of the suit the defendant Mollie Carleton had married William Shockley; that the given names of the other defendants were as stated in the sheriff’s return; -that the note was given for a part of the purchase money of block 42 in the city of Denison; and concluded with a prayer for citation to the defendants to answer said amended petition, for the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the minor defendants, and for judgment for his debt and foreclosure of his lien. At the same term of the court, J. R. Cox was appointed guardian ad litem as prayed for in the petition, and answered for- the minors, denying all the allegations in the petition, “except the making and executing of the note and the purchase of the land mentioned;” and on the next day judgment by default was rendered in favor of plaintiff for the balance due on the note against the defendant Mollie Shockley, and foreclosing the vendor’s lien as above set forth. The defendant in error moves to dismiss the writ of error, on the ground that plaintiffs in error are seeking to prosecute the same by a next friend instead of by their guardian ad litem appointed by the court to represent their interests in the controversy; the contention being that he alone has the right to say whether or not the case shall be brought for revision to this court. The question presented is not without difficulty, but we are of opinion that the motion is not well taken. Statutes regulating the practice in suits instituted in behalf of or against infants are generally enacted for their protection, and are not to be used to their injury, they being generally regarded as wards of the court, whose interests are not to be sacrificed through unnecessary technicalities. In Robson v. Osborne, 13 Texas, 298, it is said; “It seems that, in general, any one who will undertake the office may be the prochein amy of an infant, and may maintain the suit in that capacity, if it appears to the court to be for the benefit of the infant. And although an infant has a guardian assigned him by the court, or appointed by will, yet where he is plaintiff, the course in chancery, it is said, is not to call the guardian by that name, but to call him the next friend. Bradley v. Amidon, 10 Paige, 235; Dan. Chan. Prac., 89. An infant may sue by his next friend, notwithstanding he have a guardian, if the guardian do not dissent. Thomas v. Dike, 11 Vt., 273; Dan. Chan. Prac., ch. 3, part 2, title ‘Infants.’ A fortiori, he may do so where the guardian has left the country, and has failed in the performance of duties which, devolved upon him for the preservation of the rights of his ward.” In this case it is not made to appear that the guardian ad litem has left the country; but it seems that he has failed to bring the case before this court for a period of about eight years, from which it may be inferred that he has no intention of doing so. It does not appear, however, from the record that he objects to the prosecution of this writ of error, and we are of opinion that under the circumstances the minors against whom the judgment was rendered should not be denied the right to a hearing in this court when their interests are presented by a prochein amy. We believe these views are sustained by the reasoning of our Supreme Court, after full consideration on rehearing in the case of Brooke v. Clark, 57 Texas, 105. The motion to dismiss the writ of error will therefore be overruled. Upon its merits, the case presents the anomaly of plaintiffs in error bringing before us for revision a judgment which they contend is not final because it does not dispose of all the parties to the controversy. If the judgment, as contended for by them, is not final, we would have ño jurisdiction further than to dismiss the writ of error at their cost; but upon examination, we are of opinion that the judgment complained of does finally dispose of the entire subject matter of the controversy as to all of the parties. The plaintiff in the court below did not seek a personal judgment against any of the defendants except Mrs. Mollie Shockley, against whom it was rendered, and the defendant William Shockley was only made a party pro forma as husband of his codefendant, and the other defendants were made parties as the heirs of the deceased L. W. Carlton, no judgment being sought against them except a foreclosure of the vendor’s lien upon the land for which the note was given; and we think the effect of the judgment was to foreclose the lien against all of the parties to the suit, although they were not specifically named in the clause granting such foreclosure. Plaintiffs in error, in their first proposition under their first assignment, contend that the judgment by default against them was erroneous, because their given names were not stated in the original petition, nor in the citation served upon them, and no citation was issued upon or service had under the amended petition, and we believe this objection to the judgment to be well taken. The original petition alleged that these parties resided in the county in which the suit was instituted, and gave no reason why their names could not be ascertained. We have a statute which authorizes a suit against unknown heirs, and in such eases service is had by publication. Eev. Stats., art. 1236. Where personal service is sought, one of the requirements of the statute is that the citation shall contain the names of all the parties. Eev. Stats., art. 1215. The question presented to us is not whether the judgment, for the reasons here indicated, would be void upon collateral attack, but the question is, was the proceeding regular? We are constrained to hold that it was not. Appellee seeks to sustain the judgment upon the ground, that inasmuch as it contains a recital that all the defendants had been cited by personal service, this should be presumed, and that we should presume that service had been had upon the amended petition as prayed for therein; but this position can not be sustained. To sustain a judgment by default on appeal, the record must show good service outside of the recital in the judgment. Burditt v. Howth, 45 Texas, 466; Fitch v. Boyer, 51 Texas, 344; Wheeler v. Ahrenbeak, 54 Texas, 536; Treadway v. Eastburn, 57 Texas, 214; Hart v. Weatherford, 19 Texas, 57. Besides, it will be observed that a judgment by default was taken at the same term at which the amendment was filed, and it would seem that the service recited in the judgment could not have been had. It is true William Shocklev might have accepted service, but the minors could only have been served in the regular way. Wheeler v. Ahrenbeak, supra. Plaintiffs in error, in their third and fifth assignments, seek to take advantage of the alleged irregularity in rendering a personal judgment against the defendant Mrs. Mollie Shockley without service upon her husband, and also because it appears from the petition that she was a married woman at the time she signed the note, but as she is not a party to this writ of error, we are of opinion that these assignments should not bo considered. We are of opinion that the court below had the power to reinstate the case after its dismissal at the same term, without notice to the defendants. Hooker v. Williamson, 60 Texas, 524; Wood v. Wheeler, 7 Texas, 13; Blum v. Wettermark, 58 Texas, 125; Williams v. Huling, 43 Texas, 113. For the error above indicated, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 9, 1893.","Rosa Carlton et al. v. J. K. Miller. No. 113. 1. Guardian Ad Litem — Writ of Error Prosecuted by Next Friend.—Minor defendants against whom a judgment has been rendered may prosecute a writ of error by next friend to reverse the judgment, although a guardian ad litem was appointed to represent them in the suit in which the-judgment was rendered, where such guardian has neglected for eight years to carry up the case for review, and it does not appear from the record that he objects to the writ being so prosecuted. 2. Final Judgment—Foreclosure of Vendor’s Lien.—Where suit is brought on a purchase money note against the heirs of the maker to foreclose the vendor's lien, no personal judgment being asked against the defendants, a judgment foreclosing the lien is a final judgment as to the defendants, although they are not specifically named in the clause granting such foreclosure. 3. Judgment by Default—Citation not Showing Christian Name of Defendant.—A judgment by default against minor defendants is error where their given names were not stated in the original petition, nor in the citation served on them, and no citation was issued on an amended petition in which their names were properly set out; the original petition alleging that they resided in the county, and giving no reason why their names could not be ascertained. 4. Same — No Presumption from Recitals in Judgment.—To sustain a judgment by default on appeal, the record must show good service of citation, outside of the recital of service in the judgment. 5. Practice on Appeal — Error as to Party not Appealing. — Plaintiffs in error can not complain that a personal judgment was wrongly renderect against a married woman, codefendant with them below, without service on her husband, where such married woman is not a party to the writ of error. 6. Practice—Reinstatement of Case Without Notice.—Where the court, of its own motion, dismisses a case for want of prosecution, it has the power to reinstate it at the same term without notice to the defendant. Error from Grayson. Tried below before Hon. Richard Maltbie. W. W. Wilkins, R. R. Hazlewood, and G. G. Randell, for plaintiffs in error. 1. The judgment in this case recites that all of the defendants named in plaintiff’s amended original petition were duly served with citation, but does not finally dispose of any of said defendants, except Mollie Shockley, alias Mollie Carlton, and is therefore not a final judgment. Rodrigues v. Trevino, 54 Texas, 198; Linn v. Arambould, 55 Texas, 611; Railway v. Smith County, 58 Texas, 74. 2. The plaintiff’s petition showed that all of the defendants resided in Grayson County at the time of filing the suit, and it was error for the court below to enter any judgment affecting the rights of these plaintiffs in error upon a petition and citation neither of which contained their names. And the fact that plaintiff, more than two years afterward, filed an amended petition giving their names would not give the court jurisdiction, without service on 'said amended petition. Sayles’ Civ. Stats.,, arts. 1195,"" 1215; Weems v. Sheriff, 48 Texas, 481. 3.

Donoho, 4 Texas, 336; Smith v. Taylor, 34 Texas, 603; Callison v. Autry, 4 Texas, 371; Hall v. Jackson, 3 Texas, 305. 3. If it be true that the court erred in rendering judgment against William Shockley and Mollie Shockley for any reason, they not having joined in this writ of error nor assigned error, these plaintiffs in error can not take advantage of errors committed against their said codefendants which errors do .not affect the plaintiffs in error.

McGowen, 58 Texas, 608; Bank v. Clare, 76 Texas, 47. 4. The petition alleged that the names of the plaintiffs in error were unknown, but described them, and service was had upon them by their proper names; the court appointed a guardian ad litem for them, who appeared and defended the suit, and this court will not review the action of the District Court in that matter. Smith v. Taylor, 34 Texas, 589."
"COLLARD, Associate Justice. Suit by appellee, Bertie Vancil, against appellant, to recover damages for the value of the use of a trunk and contents (being wearing apparel, etc.) during the time the same was unreasonably delayed by defendant. The value of such use is laid at $250. Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $125. Defendant appealed. The plaintiff, Bertie Vancil, a single lady, of age, resident of Gonzales County, Texas, intending to go to her brother, about sixteen miles from Ballinger, on a visit for several months (and to accompany a sister who was in feeble health), reached San Antonio, where, after remaining all night, on the morning of the 17th of January, 1889, she purchased a through passenger ticket to Ballinger, Texas, from a railway company which connected with defendant’s railroad at Temple, Texas, the route from Temple to Ballinger being over defendant’s road. She had her trunk checked through and received check for same, number 93. She arrived at Ballinger about 5 o’clock the next morning, had demand made for her trunk by virtue of the check, and again, on the 6th of February, made personal demand for it, and failed to- get it. She brought suit for it, after which it was found and restored to her at her brother’s-house, on the 15th day of February, by the company’s agent, who carried it to her. The evidence shows that the check was lost from the trunk. The baggage master in the employ of defendant at Ballinger at the time the trunk should have arrived was discharged about the 19th or 20th of January, and left on the 21st, and carried the trunk with him, claiming it as his own. The company afterwards found it at Temple and had it conveyed to the plaintiff. It was a large-sized zinc trunk, and contained plaintiff’s wearing apparel, and articles for personal use such as a lady would provide for herself for an absence from home on a visit of several months. During the time plaintiff was deprived of her trunk, she had no other clothes except what she had on and what she borrowed from friends. She says she suffered great inconvenience on account of it, and that the use of the clothes was worth to her $250 during the time. She valued the contents of the trunk at $500. The court instructed the jury that the measure of damages was the value of the use of the property to the plaintiff during the delay in delivering it to her. There is no objection to the charge. It. is the law of the case. 3 Suth. on Dam., 294; Fairfax v. Railway, 73 N. Y., 167; 3 Willson’s C. C., sec. 391. It is objected by the appellant, that plaintiff was permitted by the-court to state the amount of the value of the use of her property during1 the time she was deprived of it. The testimony was admissible.. There was no market value of such property, and in such case opinions of witnesses familiar with the facts, together with the facts and conditions, are admissible, to be judged by the jury in estimating the damages. It would be difficult in cases like this to determine the value of use by a mere statement of the facts. The-opinion of a person having a knowledge of the facts would be some evidence, not an absolute guide—not binding upon the jury—but an assistance which would be available in the absence of more reliable proof. 1 Suth. on Dam., secs. 687, 802; 3 Suth. on Dam., sec. 294; Heligmann v. Rose, 81 Texas, 222. The court below observed the proper rule in admitting the opinion of plaintiff. The jury did not adopt her opinion, but evidently considered it and all the other facts before them, as they should have done. We are not in a position to hold that the verdict should be set aside because there was no evidence to support it, as insisted by appellant, or because it was excessive. It was the privilege of the jury to consider the nature of the loss, and the circumstances of the deprivation as it bore upon plaintiff at the time. She was not entitled to vindictive damages, but only to the value to her of the use at the time in her situation, and we can not say the jury have certainly exceeded the proper measure of such value. Our opinion is, that the judgment should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed. Delivered February 8, 1893.","Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company v. Bertie Vancil. No. 82. 1. Value — Opinion Testimony.—A lady passenger on a railway was deprived of the use of her wearing apparel, etc., in her trunk, which was delayed in delivery from January 18 until February 15. On the trial of an action for damages she was properly allowed to testify, that “ the use of the clothes, etc., was worth $250 during the time.” The opinion was competent, to aid the jury. 2. Verdict not Excessive.—A verdict for $125 was not excessive, where a lady visiting at a distance from home was deprived of the use of wearing apparel, save what she had on, for nearly a month, by the negligence of the railway company to deliver her trunk carried with her as baggage. 3. Measure of Damages.—The measure of damages for the nondelivery of baggage of a passenger is the value of the use of the property to the owner during the delay in delivery. Appeal from County Court of Bunnells. Tried below before Hon.W. A. Proctor, County Judge. J. W. Terry, for appellant. 1. The court erred in admitting, over the objection of defendant, the answer of plaintiff to the ninth interrogatory, as follows: “ The value of the use of my trunk and its contents, of which I was so deprived, is two hundred and fifty dollars.” First. Because said answer was a mere conclusion of the witness. Second. Because it was only her right to state the facts and circumstances surrounding her case, and it then became the province of the jury to assess the amount of the damages, if any, she sustained. 2. The verdict was excessive. Railway v. Taylor, 3 Willson’s C. C., sec. 193; Brown v. Adams, 3 Willson’s C. C., sec. 391. Powell & Smith, for appellee."
"HEAD, Associate Justice. The land in controversy was patented to Geo. F. Bridgeman, April 8, 1876. The patentee was a member of W. J. Bullock’s company, Second Georgia Battalion, and fell with Fannin at Goliad. Appellees claimed as the heirs of the patentee. Appellants claim under a deed purporting to have been made by Jane Bridge-man, Sarah Bridgemam, and Alfred A. Bridgeman, in the city of Philadelphia, on the 30th day of May, 1853, in which deed the grantors claim to be the heirs of the patentee. The court below, as we think upon sufficient evidence, found that appellees were the true heirs, and rendered judgment in their favor. Appellants also claimed by limitation, and the evidence to sustain this defense is as follows: “It is agreed that upon the question of limitation the defendants proved, that they had a deed to the land in controversy duly registered ■ for more than five years before the institution of this suit; that they redeemed the land from all taxes prior to the year 1883. In 1883 the lands were rendered as their property and marked paid on the rolls, and they paid all taxes from 1884 to 1888, and about June, 1883, they constructed a post and wire fence around a pasture of about 40,000 acres of land, including the land in controversy, and occupied the said pasture for grazing cattle from that time until the institution of this suit, and claimed to own a part and have control of all the lands in controversy; and on this branch of the case defendants proved that there was a public road leading from Henrietta, the county seat, to Charley, in Clay County, which passes through said pasture for a distance of about 12 miles, which was at all times a public traveled county road; that said road was gated at its exit and entrance when said pasture was built, the latter of which was taken down about three years since and the former about two years, since which time said road has not been in any way obstructed; that there is no fence or other improvement than said tank on the land in controversy, and said road ran across one corner of it; that there was about thirteen sections of land in said pasture owned and controlled by parties other than defendants, several of which were never controlled by defendants; that other parties, not tenants of defendants, ranched in said pasture during said time, and one Jordan had at all times about 400 head of cattle grazing therein; that defendants were in litigation with said Jordan about three years, trying to eject his cattle from said pasture, and failed to do so; that Jordan had most of the time about 1000 acres in said pasture, over which defendants had no control; that during the year 1887 one Tobin, Pratt, and Lippincott each had lands leased from others, which they had for grazing purposes, and was a part of the above thirteen sections.” The court below rendered judgment in favor of appellees for the land in controversy, from which this appeal is taken. Appellant calls in question the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding of the court below that appellees were the heirs of the patentee of this land. The evidence upon this point was: First. The deposition of Caroline E. Smith, who testified, that her residence is in Heard County, Georgia; that she is 58 years of age; that her first husband was Robinson Brigman; that she first became acquainted with the Brigman family in the year 1852; that she had heard her first husband and his mother, Temperance Brigman, say that said Robinson Brigman had a brother whose name was George F. Brigman; that said George F. Brigman was killed in Texas in the year 1836 in the' war between Texas and Mexico; that she had always heard the mother of her said husband, Robinson Brigman, say that George F. Brigman was killed in the war between' Texas and Mexico, in the year 1836; that such was the family tradition; * * *' that she never knew George F. Brigman personally; never saw his name written; never saw or had any family record; never heard George F. Brigman’s name spelled or saw it written, and could not write his name; that she can not write; that she can not give an exact copy of the initials or of the spelling of his name; that George F. Brigman was never married. Second. The deposition of Kansas Jones (formerly Brigman), J. H. Brigman, and Mary Knoff, all of whom testified, that their father, Robinson Brigman, had a brother George F. Brigman, who died unmarried, and that they knew this from family reputation, and that they all reside in Heard County, Georgia. Third. One W. T. Wood also testified for plaintiff, by deposition, that he was 62 years of age; that he resides at Franklin, in Heard County, Georgia, and is well acquainted with the plaintiffs and has known them for twenty-five or thirty years, and has had business transactions with them; that he is judge of the Court of Ordinary; that plaintiffs are ignorant and illiterate; that they can neither read nor write; that their name is called Bridgman and Brigman; that they are known by both names; that the said Bridgman and Brigman family have a family tradition that George F. Brigman, the brother of plaintiffs’ father, was killed in the war between Texas and Mexico, in the year 1836, and that plaintiffs as his heirs claim to own land in Texas; that he has heard this for many years. Fourth. A part of the muster roll of Captain W. J. Bullock’s company, Second Georgia Battalion, First Regiment, was read in evidence, showing the name of G. F. Bridgeman as one of the privates therein, and a certificate from the Commissioner of the General Land Office, showing that no other name similar to Bridgman or Brigman appeared upon any of the muster rolls of those engaged in the war between Texas and Mexico. The defendants read in evidence the deed under which they claim, set forth in the conclusions of fact, and an affidavit purporting to have been made by Samuel Nelson and A. F. Smith, at the time of the execution of said deed, showing that the parties making that deed were the heirs of George F. Bridgeman, who fell with Fannin at Goliad; but no attempt was made to trace any of the parties to this deed or affidavit, and the earliest evidence we have as to the existence of such deed, other than its date, is the fact that it was recorded in Bosque County in October, 1872, and was delivered to Dunlap by his vendor, Brock, in January, 1873. No objection was made on the trial below to any of the evidence set forth above. The evidence was full that the appellees were the heirs of the George F. Brigman referred to in the depositions introduced by them. If the heirship of plaintiffs depended entirely upon the similarity of the name Brigman with that of Bridgeman, to whom the land was patented, we do not think the judgment of the court below could be sustained; but when we add to this the facts, that the plaintiffs in this case are ignorant, illiterate people; that their name is sometimes called Brig-man and sometimes Bridgman; that they live in the State from which the patentee seems to have come; that they had an uncle whose given name was George F., the same as that of the patentee; that there has always existed in their family a tradition that this uncle was killed in 1836 in Texas, in the war between Texas and Mexico; that they have for years claimed to own land in Texas as his heirs; that no other person of a name at all similar was engaged in this war; we are not prepared to say that the finding of the court was not correct. Baker v. McFarland, 77 Texas, 294; Leland v. Eckert, 81 Texas, 226. The Texas Land and Mortgage Company, Limited, was made a defendant in the court below, and filed its answer, pleading not guilty, and vouching in its remote warrantor, W. J. Kellar, who appeared and undertook the defense of the case. Kellar pleaded not guilty and the statutes of limitation of three, five, and ten years, his plea of the five years statute being as follows: “And for further plea in this behalf the said defendant says that said plaintiffs ought not to have or maintain their aforesaid action thereof against him, because, he says, he has had and held peaceable, continuous, uninterrupted, and exclusive adverse possession under title (or color of title) from and under the State of Texas of the lands and tenements claimed in said plaintiffs’ petition, for more than five years next before the commencement of this suit, and this he is ready to verify,’ ’ etc. The deed made by this defendant, under which the original defendants claim, was dated January 30, 1883, and from the foregoing conclusions of fact it will be seen that the first possession claimed by defendant was that of Butler Brothers, who commenced to fence the pasture in June, 1883, evidently claiming under this deed.- We are therefore of the opinion that the allegation in this plea that Kellar had had possession for five years, or in fact had ever had possession of this land, is not sustained by the evidence, and for this reason the court below did not err in finding in favor of plaintiffs on the question of limitation. In Cunningham v. Frantdzen, 26 Texas, 39, it is said: “ The manner of pleading the statute of limitations shows that the defendants relied on their own possession as connected with that of Hays, and not upon that of Hays for three years, disconnected from their own. The charges of the court are shaped with reference to that construction of the plea, and so the verdict of the jury embraces it in its general finding for the defendants. Therefore, although the evidence may show that Hays had possession for three years, under color of title at sometime, though not immediately before suit brought, and although that should be held to extinguish Cunningham’s title and confer title on Hays, still that issue not being made by the pleadings and found by the verdict, the judgment can not be sustained for defendants on that ground. A defense of the statute of limitations is required to be specially pleaded; and therefore, if defendants had relied upon title in Hays by his three years possession, under color of title, disconnected from their own possession, they should have pleaded it in that form, so as to have given notice of it.” Delivered November 22, 1892. It is not to be questioned that it was the duty of Kellar as warrantor to present the defense of the statute of limitations so as to protect his vendees (Brown v. Hear on, 66 Texas, 63); but we are of opinion that when he relies upon their possession, and not upon his own, he should, plead the statute in that form, so as to apprise his opponents of what they are called upon to meet; and that an allegation that he, Kellar, had been in possession five years is not sustained by proof that his vendees had such possession. It will also be noticed that this plea of the five years statute nowhere contains an allegation that defendants claimed under a deed duly registered, or that they had paid taxes for the requisite time, and it may also be doubted whether on account of that omission the plea would be sufficient to sustain a judgment based upon this statute, although no exception was made to it (Blackwell v. Patton, 23 Texas, 670; Portis v. Hill, 3 Texas, 280), but we do not express any opinion as to this. For the reasons above indicated, it will not be necessary for us to consider the sufficiency of. the evidence as set forth in the conclusions of fact, to establish the adverse possession and payment of taxes necessary to sustain the defense under the five years statute. Facts somewhat similar are considered in the cases of Taliaferro v. Butler, 77 Texas, 578, and Church v. Waggoner, 78 Texas, 200. It will be noted that this judgment was rendered previous to our recent legislation on the subject of limitation as applicable to land embraced in large pastures. It is not pretended that the evidence shows any defense in favor of appellants under the three and ten years statutes. Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be in all things affirmed, and it is so ordered. Affirmed.","Texas Land and Mortgage Company et al. v. Kansas Bridgeman et al. No. 39. 1. Limitation — Five Years Statute — How Pleaded by Warrantor. — A warrantor impleaded by the defendants may present the defense of limitations so as to protect his vendees, but when he relies upon their possession and not his own he should plead the statute in that form. A plea that he had been in possession five years is not sustained by proof that his vendees had such possession. ' 2. Same — Plea Must Allege, what. — It may be doubted whether a plea of the five years statute which nowhere contains an allegation that defendants claimed under a deed registered, or that they paid the taxes for the requisite time, would be sufficient to sustain a judgment based upon this statute, although no exception was made to it. 3. Proof of Heirship — Fact Case. — See proof of the heirship of one who fell at Goliad held sufficient, despite a discrepancy in spelling the family name; also other proof of heirship by affidavit and by recital in a deed, held insufficient. Appeal from Clay. Tried below before 1-Ion. P. M. Stine. Coombes & Gano, for appellants. 1. The deed from Jane, Sarah, and Alfred A.

The only evidence offered tending to show or intimating that appellants’ vendees were the heirs of Geo. F. Bridgeman, was the recitals in their deed — a mere declaration in interest. 1 Greenl.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. The Hercules Iron Works, the appellee, brought this suit May 17,1889, against the Alamo Mills Company, now known as the Crystal Ice Manufacturing Company, and by an amended petition, filed January 10, 1890, alleged, that on the 26tli day of December, 1887, plaintiff entered into an agreement with defendant for the purpose of erecting an icé plant, consisting of two parts, with a daily capacity of forty tons of clear ice, to be produced from condensed steam, one half to be ready by March 1 and the other half to be ready by April 1, 1888, for which said Alamo Mills Company agreed to pay the sum of $13,485, the sum of $6000 to be paid when the first twenty-ton plant had been run fifteen days and demonstrated its ability to perform the work mentioned, and the balance to be paid after a like trial of the second plant of twenty tons, and its satisfactory performance of the work agreed upon for it. That said plant was to be turned over in good order and condition by plaintiff to defendant, and if anything was necessary to the production of the forty tons of clear ice per day it was to be furnished by plaintiff without charge. The petition further avers, “that plaintiff complied with its contract in every particular, furnished the machinery of the contract power, with the materials as agreed, and of the quality stipulated, and in every particular complied with its contract, with the exception that, owing to unforeseen circumstances, and the misconduct of defendants .in refusing to furnish labor and material for making ice when the plant was ready, plaintiff did not have the plants producing ice until a few weeks after the date agreed upon; but plaintiff saved defendant from whatever loss it might have incurred thereby, and now is and always has been ready and willing to pay defendant whatever loss it sustained by reason of plaintiff not having the plant in operation on April 1, 1888, if in equity it should; and that when said plant was completed it was turned over to defendant in good order and condition. That defendant continually threw obstacles in the way of plaintiff in completing said plant, and prevented plaintiff making the tests agreed, and expressed at different times its satisfaction with the plant, and though often requested, refused, etc., to plaintiff’s damage $13,813.18 and interest from April 1, 1888.” The petition further states, that after the plant was turned over to defendant and plaintiff’s workmen had returned to their homes (in Chicago), defendant “grossly mistreated the plant,” and used it so negligently that it was greatly impaired and became worthless, when defendant instructed plaintiff to repair the same, which it did, at an expense and cost for labor and material of the value of $1404, as shown by itemized account. That after the contract, defendant instructed plaintiff to make the plant more solid and complete, and that defendant would pay therefor; that plaintiff did, as directed, make such improvements (not required to the production of forty tons of clear ice per day), of the reasonable value as set out in bill of particulars. The total of both accounts, beside the amount due on the first contract, amounts to $4262.79. Prayer for judgment for amounts due as alleged. Defendant filed general demurrer; and specially excepted to the sufficiency of the allegations in the petition that defendant obstructed the performance of the contract in time, without stating the facts constituting such obstructions. Defendant also filed a general denial and a number of special answers: 1. A plea in reconvention for $80,000, loss of profits resulting from plaintiff’s failure to furnish and construct the ice factory of the capacity agreed on, and from delay in erecting the same, the $80,000 being the loss of. profits that would have been made during the season of 1888. 2. Plea in reconvention for $14,000, the alleged rental value of the premises for the year, lost by plaintiff’s failure to perform the contract. 3. To recover $7000, rent of the machinery and premises as they were before plaintiff undertook to put in the new machinery, lost by plaintiff’s alleged failure. 4. To recover $6000 paid plaintiff on the contract, under the belief that it would be completed, and showing that there was no alternative left defendant but to take charge of the machinery as left by plaintiff and to utilize it to the best advantage. 5. Plea of payment and setoff, $8502.82. 6. To recover loss incurred by defendant in furnishing one Kampman ice, pursuant to a contract made with him by defendant — a special loss to defendant resulting from plaintiff’s failure. Other matters of defense were set up. The case was tried by a jury; there was a verdict and judgment rendered thereon for the plaintiff for $6825, with interest from June 30, 1888, at 8 per cent per annum. Plaintiff entered a remittitur of $2450 as rent of the plant from March 1, to June 30, 1888, leaving, as stated in the order of remittitur, a judgment against defendant for $4375, and interest from June 30, 1888, at 8 per cent per annum. Defendant appealed. The contract to furnish and construct the plant by plaintiff, and defendant’s agreement to pay for it, was in writing and is as follows: “San Antonio, Texas, December 26th, 1887. “ Agreement made between the Hercules Iron Works of Chicago, and the Alamo Mills Company of San Antonio. < “ The Hercules Iron Works hereby agree to furnish an ice-making plant complete, with a daily capacity of forty tons of ice, the same to include two tanks, with all coils, valves, pumps, distilling apparatus, filter, air pump, water coolers, charcoal filters, machinery for small water wheel, necessary change in the steam engine, well, condenser house, insulation, and all wood work connected with the plant, etc. “One-half of the plant to be ready March 1, the second half by April 1, the same to be transferred to the Alamo Mills Company in complete working order for the sum of $13,485 and the cost of the freezing cans. “The plant is to be two complete twenty-ton plants, capable of producing forty tons of clear ice per day. “ The Alamo Mills Company agree to pay all railroad freight on goods shipped to them by the Hercules Iron Works; to pay for the freezing cans when requested so to do by the Hercules Iron Works; to pay when the first twenty-ton plant has been run fifteen days and demonstrates its ability to perform the work mentioned, the sum of $6000; and to pay the balance, say $7485, after a like trial of the second plant of twenty tons and its satisfactory performance of the work agreed upon. “ Further, the Hercules Iron Works hereby guarantees that this plant will not require more than one hundred pounds, say $50 worth, of ammonia per month after the first charge has been put in; also guaranteeing the material and workmanship of the highest order; also that forty tons of ice from condensed steam can be made daily with this plant, with an expenditure of McAlester coal, or its equivalent, not exceeding six and a half tons. “It is understood that this plant is to be complete in every respect; that it is to be turned over by the Hercules Iron Works in good order and condition; and if anything is necessary to the production of forty tons of clear ice per day by this plant, and has not been mentioned herein, it will be furnished without charge by the Hercules Iron Works. “Alamo Mills Company, J. S. Lockwood, President. “Hercules Iron Works, Chas. A. McDonald, President.” The first error assigned is addressed to action of the court in overruling defendant’s special exceptions to the averment charging defendant with obstructing the completion of the plant, without stating the facts constituting the obstructions. We think that the allegation is too general and is subject to the special exception. The plaintiff assumed the burden of showing that its admitted delay in completing the plant in the time required by the contract was owing to something done by defendant. The allegation should have stated what was done — what the obstructions were. Defendant had the right to know, by proper pleading, what acts or omissions it was charged with that interfered with the plaintiff in carrying out its agreement, so as to prepare such defense as there might be to the charge. Neither the court nor the defendant could know what facts would be relied upon to sustain the charge, or what was intended to be proved to show that defendant had obstructed the completion of the plant in time. Defendant alleged that time was of the essence of the contract. This was reasonable, considering the purpose. Plaintiff, anticipating this, attempted to excuse itself and make defendant responsible for the failure to comply with the contract in time. It should have stated the facts imposing' this responsibility upon defendant, and not the mere conclusion. This rule of pleading is elementary. Thompson v. Munger, 15 Texas, 523; Ellis v. Singletary, 45 Texas, 27; Caldwell v. Haley, 3 Texas, 317; Morrison v. Ins. Co., 69 Texas, 353. The allegation that the delay was caused by misconduct of defendant in refusing to furnish labor and material for making ice, was vague and unsatisfactory, and was only sufficient to admit under it the character of proof indicated, and it would be so limited. But clearly, if not allowed under this, no proof could be admitted under the allegation to which the exception was taken showing defendant’s responsibility for the delay. The court erred as stated in the assignment. The record in this case is very voluminous, and there are some forty or more assignments of error presented in appellant’s brief, some of which need not be separately considered. A decision upon one of a group will be sufficient to determine the rest. For example, all the evidence predicated upon the foregoing allegation objected to by defendant was improperly admitted, and the assignments of error thereto will be sustained without further notice. When the petition is amended, as it probably will be before another trial, such errors will not occur. It is insisted by appellant that the court erred in sustaining plaintiff’s exceptions to that part of the answer which set up loss of profits that would have been realized during the ice season from the 1st of March to the 1st of November, 1888, if plaintiff had furnished the plant for manufacturing ice in the time, of the power, and of the kind to produce the quality of ice stipulated in the contract. That part of the answer set up, that defendant, as a corporation to manufacture ice in San Antonio, was, prior to the contract with plaintiff, extensively engaged in the manufacture of ice, and as such had a large and established trade that required forty tons of ice per day; that it owned and used for its business a valuable factory for producing ice, consisting of site, buildings, machinery, in San Antonio, of the value of $75,000, and it had contracted with one Kampman to deliver him 1000 tons of ice, by written contract (set out in full), for the consideration of $9000, to be delivered to him at the door of its factory in amounts as called for, not to exceed ten tons per day, delivery to begin on April 1, 1888, or if the mills should be running before that date, then the ice to be called for before said date at any time when the mills were in full operation; the contract dated December 3, 1887. That the principal season for selling ice in San Antonio begins the first of March and ends the first of November of each year. That the trade of defendant demanded a machine that would manufacture forty tons of ice daily. That with the view to meet the demands of its trade, and to carry out its contract, it became necessary to increase the capacity of its plant, to remove parts of its machinery and improve with other machinery, as advised by plaintiff, which machinery plaintiff proposed to furnish, and to effect such ends it entered into the contract with plaintiff on the 26th day of December, 1887, which is herein before set out in full. The legal effect of and obligation of plaintiff under the contract are then set out. It is then further alleged that the machines contracted for were manufactured solely by plaintiff, and defendant could not purchase them in any other market (the Chicago market). That after the time for the completion of the machines by the contract, there was not time to procure other machinery and get the same in operation to produce ice for the season of 1888. That at the time of the contract, and before the first of March, plaintiff had notice of all the facts set out, and the contract was made with knowledge by the parties, and with reference to such facts, that by the agreement and the circumstances the time for the delivery of the machinery, tested and completed, was made of the essence of the contract; that though often demanded, plaintiff wholly failed to furnish the plants contracted for that would produce forty tons of clear ice per day; that pretending to comply with the contract, plaintiff furnished a machine that would not produce more than twenty tons per day, and that of an inferior and unmarketable quality; and this was not furnished until June 1, 1888. That the cost of operating it was greater than agreed, in labor, fuel, and ammonia. That during the delay defendant’s machine was idle. That the ice factories in San Antonio could not supply the demands of their trades, and defendant could not purchase ice in San Antonio to supply its trade, and on account of the cost of shipment ice could not be purchased elsewhere and brought to San Antonio and sold at a profit. That by reason of plaintiff’s failure to furnish the plant contracted for, defendant could not make and dispose of forty tons of ice per day. That ice was worth in San Antonio during each day of the season $10 per ton, and the cost of making ice on the machine agreed to be furnished by plaintiff, during the season, would have been only $1.50 per ton, whereby, by plaintiff’s failure to perform its contract, defendant has been damaged, etc. The court below sustained plaintiff’s exception to so much of this answer as set up loss of profits as the measure of damages. The right or not to recover profits for a breach of a contract does not depend upon an arbitrary rule to be adopted by a court, but upon the principles that should control the right. The law does not condemn profits as such as a measure of damages. The question is, would the loss of profits be the direct result of the breach, and would such loss “ reasonably be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties at. the time of making the contract?” Conjectural profits would not be allowed, not for the reason that profits are proscribed, but because they are uncertain; if they become sufficiently certain, are the direct result of the breach, and the parties were in possession of such facts as would charge them, as reasonably intelligent men, with the probable consequences of the breach, then profits fall within the rule, and may be recoverable as damages. Griffin v. Colver, 16 N. Y., 489; 2 Suth. on Dam., 401, 402, et seq.; Railway v. Hill, 63 Texas, 381; Jones v. George, 61 Texas, 345; 1 Sedg. on Dam., sec. 192. Speculative damages are not allowed, whether of profits or other results. Expected profits in business are generally too uncertain and remote. But every case will depend upon its own facts. In this case, we think the allegations of expected profits from the manufacture and sale of ice during the season would not be a sufficiently reliable and certain basis for estimating the damages for failure to furnish the plant according to the contract; but the profits that would have been made on'the Kampman contract may be recovered if proved as alleged. The allegation makes them ascertainable from elements known to the parties at the time the contract was made. Plaintiff, represented by McDonald, its president, knew that defendant had made the contract with Kampman to furnish him 1000 tons of ice for $9000 paid, as well as the terms of the same as to time of delivery; he, McDonald, knew all the conditions; that the plant lie agreed to furnish would be relied on to make this ice; he knew, it is alleged, the cost of production of ice on his proposed machinery, $1.50 per ton, and that there was to be no further expense on the part of defendant, as the ice was to be delivered at the factory door. It seems that there can be no doubt but that the profits ascertainable from the contract were in contemplation of the parties when they made the contract sued on. The contract sued on was made with special reference to the Kampman contract, and that defendant would be entitled to profits to be had on the latter until it was completed during the time of the alleged delay. The general profits expected from the business lack the necessary elements of certainty of computation; the parties may have supposed there would be profits in the business, yet the amount could not have been reasonably determined, owing to the fluctuations of the market price, and other con-' siderations. The price was fixed for the amount of ice to be delivered to Kampman. We conclude that there was error in sustaining plaintiff’s exception to so much of the answer as set up profits on the Kampman contract as damages for the alleged breach. This conclusion will also apply to the ruling of the court in sustaining plaintiff’s exceptions to the sixth count in the answer, which sets up actual loss on the part of defendant in procuring ice at great expense for the Kampman contract. The cost of supplying the ice above what it would have cost if plaintiff had furnished the machinery contracted for would be the measure of damages, provided defendant exercised ordinary care in procuring ice for Kampman. The court did not err in the charge to the effect that defendant could not recover rent for the time the construction was delayed if defendant had waived the time of performance of the contract. The assignment is, that there was no pleading or testimony to authorize the charge. The pleading might have been made more definite, but we think the point is sufficiently pleaded to admit testimony thereunder. Without intimating any opinion as to the weight of the testimony, we conclude that it was not improper to submit the issue. There was some testimony that the delay was caused by the attempted use of the Tainter process of producing steam, and that defendant consented to the trial of it. Defendant told Tainter that it would make him a present of $100 if he succeeded with the system. There are some other circumstances in proof which have a tendency to establish the proposition submitted in the charge, which the jury might have considered. It is not our province to determine the effect of the testimony offered; that was for the jury. We can determine the competency and admissibility of testimony and whether there was testimony or not, but its weight is left to the jury. We are not prepared to say that there was testimony sufficient to warrant the court’s charge as to defendant’s liability for Tainter’s services. He was employed by plaintiff, was in charge of the work, and was allowed to experiment with his system of using steam made in a vacuum — a cheap process if it could have been utilized in making ice; and it may be the defendant consented to the trial of its use. But defendant was not to construct the machine or be in charge of the work, and we are unable to find the testimony which shows that defendant was to pay for any part of Tainter’s time before he left, in June. When he returned, in 1889, to run the plant and to test its capacity, he was employed by defendant, but that is not the time in question. Plaintiff was required to furnish the plant and put it in working order, with certain ice-producing power, for a price stipulated, and which price is o sued for. While Tainter was working to accomplish this result, he was in plaintiff’s employ, and there could be no extra charge for his services. The item of charge for Tainter’s services is: “ S. B. Tainter’s time, furnished defendant by plaintiff at defendant’s request, from May 20 to June 20, 1888, thirty days, at $15 per day, $450.” McDonald, plaintiff’s president, testified that Tainter’s services were for defendant’s benefit, but that defendant did not request them. The allegation was not sustained by the proof. In regard to McDonald’s time, traveling expenses, etc., made an item m plaintiff’s account, we may say that defendant would not be liable for it if rendered for the plaintiff company in complying with its contract to furnish and construct the plant, as required by the written contract. If, however, the contract had been fully complied with, and he rendered other services under the alleged distinct verbal contract (if there was any in fact upon which defendant would be liable), if the charge was reasonable, defendant would be liable. In regard to the item for 1 ‘ Davis’ time, labor, and traveling expenses, from August 11 to September 25, inclusive, $732;” if the plaintiff had completed its contract to furnish the plant according to its terms, and defendant took charge of it, and while operating it, it was injured and impaired by negligent use of defendant, and upon request of defendant that plaintiff should repair it, Davis was sent by plaintiff to make the repairs, and did render the service as alleged, defendant would be liable for the reasonable value thereof; but if the plant was not fully completed according to contract, and defendant had not accepted the work as a full performance, and Davis was sent by plaintiff to make the machine operate according to the terms of the original contract, or if plaintiff was still bound to so complete its contract, defendant would not be liable for work and material so furnished. In presenting the case to the jury, the distinction should be observed between the duty of plaintiff to fully comply with its contract, and for any extra material and labor, furnished upon request of defendant, or necessitated by the defendant’s misuse of the machine after its completion or its acceptance as completed by defendant. Whatever work or expense may have been incurred by plaintiff in performing its contract or making it good according to its terms (unless waived by defendant) was provided for in the original contract, and its price fixed, and no extra charge could be made for any of it. But if extra work and material were furnished after the plant had been completed according to contract and delivered to defendant, they would be a proper charge if declared on. The memoranda of articles and prices made prior to the contract, and furnished by McDonald as estimated cost of the plant, allowed to be read by plaintiff, was improperly admitted in evidence, unless defendamt had before offered some part of its contents. The contract itself was the final depository of the agreement of the parties, which could not be changed or modified by contemporaneous estimates or negotiations. Milliken v. Callahan County, 69 Texas, 210. There was no ambiguity or uncertainty in the written contract; no fraud or mistake that authorized the introduction of the memoranda. 2 Whart. on Cont., 665. Appellant assigns as error the refusal of the court to give the following requested charge: “ The jury are instructed that if they believe from the evidence that the machinery furnished by plaintiff was not tested by running same fifteen days and producing forty tons of ice per day, as provided in the contract, then plaintiff can not recover the contract price of same, unless you find from the evidence that defendant accepted same as being of the .capacity called for in the contract; but if you believe that plaintiff did erect machinery which did not comply with the contract, and if you further believe from the evidence that defendant has taken possession of and used the same, then defendant must be charged with the reasonable value of the machine instead of the one contracted for.” Some such charge should have been given. If the machine was not of contract capacity, and it was left on defendant’s hands, and it did not accept it as a compliance with the contract, it should not be required to pay the contract price for it, but the price it was reasonably worth — that is, the contract price, less the damages for deficiency, which would be the difference between the agreed price and the value of the machine left on its hands. The court, over the objection of defendant, permitted McDonald, the president of plaintiff company, to testify that Lockwood, president of defendant company,.told him, about the last of May or first of June, 1888, that he (Lockwood) was satisfied with the machine, and that it was not necessary to make a test. The contract required a test of fifteen days running of the machine to demonstrate its ability to perform the work agreed. Lockwood might have accepted the plant without the test. 1-Ie could waive the test. The testimony was admissible. There was no error in permitting the witness Davis to testify that the records of the plant, kept by the engineer while being run by defendant, showed an abuse of it. The record gave the amount of ice drawn each day from June 29 to August 12, 1888, and the starting and the closing temperatures for each day. It was in proof that the machine could not be run successfully unless the temperature was considerably below the freezing point, and that a higher temperature indicated that more ice was being drawn from the machine than it was able to manufacture. Davis was allowed to state that the record of temperature 'showed that more ice was drawn than the machine could properly freeze, and that the tank was being robbed. ■ He was qualified to testify as an expert. There was no error in admitting his opinion on the issue of defendant having impaired the machine by negligent use. Delivered December 7, 1892. There are a number of assignments of error that we have not specially noticed; but most of them have been disposed of, indirectly at least. We have sufficiently indicated our opinion of the rights and liabilities of the parties, and of the questions raised, to obviate error on another trial. Some questions are necessarily eliminated by this decision in approving some portions of defendant’s pleas that were stricken out below. The right of defendant to claim profits as limited herein for the alleged breach of plaintiff’s contract, need not create any confusion upon the subject of its right to rent, or the value of the use of the machine to be furnished in case there was a breach as alleged. Of course it is not intended that it could have a double recovery. There could be no rent for such part of the power of the machine as would be employed in supplying the Kampman contract during the time of delivery thereunder, profits being allowed under that contract; but rent would be the measure of damages for the balance of the power of the machine not so employed during the time of delay,, if it should appear that the delay was a breach of the contract. We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded.","Alamo Mills Company v. Hercules Iron Works. No. 48. 1. Pleadings — Specifications.—In an action for the contract value of machinery constructed by the plaintiff, but not completed within the time specified in the contract, in excuse for the delay the petition charged the defendant with obstructing the completion of the work, without stating facts constituting such obstruction. Exceptions urged to this general allegation should have been sustained. It was error to overrule the exceptions and admit testimony under the allegation excepted to. 2. Profits as Basis for Damages. — The law does not condemn profits as such as a measure of damages. The question is, would the loss of profits be the direct result of the breach of the contract declared on, and would such loss reasonably be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties at the time of making the contract? See example. 3. Measure of Damages — Profits.—In a contract for construction of an ice machine by a day certain, it appeared that the machine was relied upon to furnish a given quantity of ice upon an existing contract. Held, that losses suffered upon such contract from the delay in the completion of the work were chargeable to the contractor, and formed a basis for recovery of damages. But under a general allegation of expected profits from the ice business during the season, and which were lost by the failure, etc., no recovery could be had. 4. Extra Compensation. — A contractor having fully completed his work upon a machine he had undertaken to construct, has the right to recover for any extra material or labor furnished upon request of the owner, or necessitated by his misuse of the machine after its completion, or its acceptance by the owner. See example. 5. Evidence Incompetent. — An itemized account of material and labor used in the negotiation of a contract is merged in a subsequent written contract, and the plaintiff suing for the contract price could not introduce such bill of items unless the defendant resisting payment had offered some part of its contents ; there being no ambiguity or uncertainty in the written contract, nor fraud or mistake alleged as basis for such testimony. 6. Charge — Partial Performance. — Action by contractor against owner for contract price of machinery. The defendant pleaded that the machine had not been delivered by the time stipulated for, nor of the earning capacity called for in the contract. Held, error to refuse a charge that the owner retaining the imperfect machine was chargeable only with the reasonable value of the machine; that is, the contract price less the damages for deficiency. 7. Testimony to Waiver — Admissions.—Declarations by the president of the defendant company made after the delivery of machinery for the defendant, were admissible against it; the president having stated that the machine was satisfactory, was competent to prove a waiver of a test contained in the contract, and to which the machine had not been subjected. 8. Opinion Testimony. — An expert was properly allowed to testify, that from records kept of the daily products of an ice machine that the machine had been abused and injured by its use. 9. Measure of Damages — Double Recovery. — A defective ice machine was the subject of litigation between the contractor furnishing it and the purchaser. The machine was not furnished at the time specified in the contract. Damages for loss of profits upon a contract for delivery of ice contemplated by the contractor when undertaking the work, are recoverable; but rents for the machinery during the delay can not be recovered save for the machinery over that necessary to fill the contract. Appeal from Bexar. Tried below before Hon. W. W. King. Barnard & Green and Denman & Franklin, for appellant. 1. The court erred in overruling defendant’s special exception, to the effect that the allegation in the petition, that defendant obstructed plaintiff in the performance of the contract, is insufficient, in that it does not allege what particular acts of obstruction defendant committed, there being no allegation in the petition charging defendant with any particular acts of obstruction, the petition only alleging in general terms that plaintiff was delayed in the construction of the machinery by the misconduct of defendant, and that defendant continually threw obstacles in the way of plaintiff, and prevented it from making the test as agreed upon, no facts being alleged. The court also erred in admitting testimony under such defective allegation. Holman v. Chriswell, 13 Texas, 38; Whitaker v. Record, 25 Texas Supp., 382; Mims v. Mitchell, 1 Texas, 446; Express Co. v. Darnell Bros., 62 Texas, 641; Morrison v. Ins. Co., 69 Texas, 359. 2. A party injured by the breach of a contract is entitled to recover all his damages resulting therefrom, including gains prevented as well as losses sustained, provided they are directly caused or naturally result from said breach, and are sufficiently certain, both in their nature and in respect to the cause from which they proceed, as to be susceptible of proof by evidence legally admissible and sufficient in law. Where there is- a loss of profits occasioned by a breach of contract, such loss is held to naturally result from said breach, in a legal sense, whenever the parties to such contract took said loss into consideration when such contract was entered into, and contracted with reference thereto, or whenever it was known, prior to the breach of such contract, by the party subsequently breaking same, that a loss of profits would directly result from such breach, and he broke the contract with the knowledge of the necessary result of his breach. 3. The right to recover loss of profits as damages for breach of a contract is mainly dependent upon the sufficiency of the evidence to establish that profits would have been realized from the performance of the contract, and that they are capable of being estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty. The right to recover such damages, therefore, must always depend upon the facts of each case, and the court can not, upon demurrer, decide as a matter of law that the loss is too remote, or that the estimate will be too uncertain, to authorize a recovery in the case before it. Wolcott v. Mount, 36 N. J., 262; White v. Miller, 71 N. Y., 118; Wakeman v. Mnfg. Co., 101 N. Y., 205; Daugherty v. Tel. Co., 75 Ala., 168; Railway v. Hale, 83 Ill., 360; Bell v.

The court erred in permitting plaintiff to read the memorandum of prices and the calculation made by a witness upon the same in the negotions leading to the contract Milliken v. Callahan County, 69 Texas, 210; Roundtree v. Gilroy, 57 Texas, 180. 5. Profits upon contracts existing between one of the parties and third persons, known to and in contemplation of the contracting parties when their contract is made, dependent upon the faithful fulfillment of the contract, may be recovered as damages, if susceptible of proof with reasonable certainty.

Wells v. Fairbanks, 5 Texas, 582; Van Alstyne v. Bertrand, 15 Texas, 179. 2. In an action of damages of this character, not only must the damages be such as may fairly be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties when they made the contract, but they must be certain, both in their nature and in respect to the cause from which they proceed, and must not be speculative or contingent; and though they may be the ordinary, natural, and even necessary result of the breach, yet, if in their nature uncertain, they must be rejected. Rental value while the machinery was idle by reason of the delay was the proper measure of damages, not the profits which might have been gained. Stark v. Alford, 49 Texas, 260; Jones v. George, 56 Texas, 149; Railway v. Joachimi, 58 Texas, 456; Railway v. Hill, 63 Texas, 381; Railway v. Young, 60 Texas, 201; Griffin v. Culner, 16 N. Y., 490; Sutton v. McDonald, 60 Am. Rep., 484. 3. A contractor who fails to perform his contract by the time limited in the contract, can not be held liable for the loss occasioned to the party for whom the work is being performed, which loss is occasioned by reason of the inability of the party for whom the work is being performed to perform contracts entered into between him and third parties, even though the contractor may have known of the existence and terms of such other contract at the time of entering into his own, unless he expressly agrees to such a rule of damages.

"WILLIAMS, Associate Justice. This case was formerly before the Supreme Court, and its decision is reported in 76 Texas, 552. It was there held, that a mandamus to compel the defendant to reinstate the plaintiff as one of its members should be denied, because it appeared from the allegations of the petition that plaintiff had a remedy by appeal to the association from the action of its board of trustees expelling him therefrom. It was said in the opinion: ■“ We think it matters not that the order of expulsion may have been contrary to law and void, and such as this court would not hesitate to annul in case there was no appeal within the association. The point is, that it was the action of the tribunal created in accordance with the constitution, and appellee had an adequate remedy by appeal within the society itself.” _ The court concluded that the exception to so much of the petition as sought a mandamus should have been sustained. Plaintiff, after the cause was remanded to the court below, amended his petition, still seeking a mandamus as well as damages for the wrongful expulsion, but added nothing sufficient to cure the defect which had been held fatal to his prayer for mandamus. A general demurrer and special exceptions to the petition were urged by defendant, the latter on the ground which had been held good by the Supreme Court, and also on the further ground that there was an improper joinder of action for mandamus and for damages. The court sustained the general demurrer and special exceptions, and upon plaintiff declining to amend, dismissed the suit. Under the former decision we must hold that the exceptions to the petition, so far as it sought a mandamus, were properly sustained. Whether or not additional facts, as to the illegality of the proceedings by which plaintiff was excluded from membership in the defendant, are alleged in the amended petition now before us,- we can not say, as we have not access to the petition on which the former appeal was decided. But none that could be stated would more than show the nullity of those proceedings; and that, as appears from the quotation above, would not meet the objection. It still appears that plaintiff could have appealed to the society from the decision of its board. It does not follow, however, that the cause should have been dismissed. The former opinion does not hold that plaintiff has no other remedy than an appeal to the association, but that the existence of that remedy precludes a resort to the writcof mandamus, because that is allowed only as a last resort. It does not hold that the decision of the board of trustees, under the facts alleged, is binding until reversed by the society. If the allegations of the petition be true, there can be no doubt that the attempted expulsion was void, and could furnish no defense to the association in depriving plaintiff of his rights as a member. He could therefore maintain an action for damages sustained, the proceedings resulting in his expulsion being null, and the petition alleges facts sufficient to entitle him to such relief. Ludowski v. Polish Society, 29 Mo. App., 337. Whether an action for mandamus could properly be joined with one for damages in such cases or not, his petition did not entitle him to the former remedy, and the exception should have been sustained to the part which was bad and overruled as to that which was good. Reversed and remanded. Delivered January 26, 1893.","Thomas Benson v. Screwmen’s Benevolent Association. No. 81. . 1. Mandamus to Restore to Membership in Association.—Under the former decision in this case, the exceptions to the petition, in so far as it sought a mandamus, were properly sustained. Allegation of the nullity of proceedings-under and by virtue of which the appellant was expelled from the defendant association, does not meet the objection, that he could have appealed to the society from the decision of its board. 2. Right of Action for Damages.—If the allegations in the petition are true, there can be no doubt that the attempted expulsion of plaintiff was void, and could furnish no defense to the association in depriving plaintiff of his rights as a member. If the proceedings were null, and his petition alleges facts sufficient to entitle him to relief, he could maintain an action for damages sustained. Appeal from Galveston. Tried below before Hon. Wm. H. Stewart. Plaintiff, in substance, alleges, that at a clandestine and secret meeting, of the board authorized by the association to try members for violation of its rules and by-laws, he was unlawfully expelled from the association for a violation of section 1, article 6, of by-laws, which provides, that-any member who by words or actions directly or indirectly injures or endeavors to injure the reputation of the association, shall, upon conviction, be suspended or expelled. The offense charged against him was the employment of outsiders in a way and at times not authorized by the rules of the association. He claims that he was expelled at a meeting of which he had no notice, without evidence, and without a trial, and claims $5000 damages for being denied membership and participation in the benefits derived therefrom and for being thereby deprived of the means-of supporting himself and family in his vocation.

"COLLARD, Associate Justice. This action was brought by the appellee, William Johnston, against Guadalupe County, the appellant, for specific performance of a contract, by which it is claimed that the county was to purchase plaintiff’s farm of 271 acres of land for a poor farm, and to pay him $6000 therefor, and' also for damages for breach of the contract. Before the trial closed plaintiff abandoned his claim for damages, and relied only upon his right to specific performance. Defendant filed a general demurrer and special exceptions to the petition, which were overruled. It also filed a general denial and special answers. The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff for specific performance, and for $6000, from which defendant has appealed, and assigns errors, two of which are as follows: “ The court erred in overruling defendant’s general demurrer to the petition herein, in that the petition does not state facts sufficient to entitle plaintiff to decree for specific performance.” “The court erred in overruling defendant’s third special exception to the petition, to the effect that tlie petition alleges that the Commissioners Court, on the 13tli day of October, 1888, made and entered of record the order of which the paper thereto attached and marked exhibit 1B ’ is a copy, and does not allege the tenor, contents, or effect of said order, and thus attempts to make an exhibit supply material averments to the petition, in contravention of the rules of pleadings prescribed for the court.” The petition relating to specific performance is as follows: “ That heretofore, to-wit, at the-term of the County Commissioners Court of Guadalupe County, he entered into an agreement with the County of Guadalupe, said county acting through and by the said Commissioners Court, to sell to said county the tract of land described in the deed hereto attached as a part of this petition, marked ‘A.’ That said county, through said court, had previously advertised for property and prices for the purpose of establishing a poor farm, or place to keep and take care of the paupers of the county, and in' obedience to said advertisement petitioner placed his property at the disposal of said county at the sum of $6000, being the property described in said deed; and thereupon said Commissioners Court, on the 13th day of October, 1888, made and entered of record the order of which the paper hereto attached marked 1 B’ is a copy. That the proposal of petitioner was made in writing. Thereupon, and being induced thereto by said order ‘ B ’ and the offer of acceptance by said county, through said court, petitioner purchased a 40-foot road, in all respects complying with the requirements of said order and acceptance, for which he paid the sum of $300; that on procuring said road, petitioner presented a deed from the owner of the land over which said road runs, and a deed from petitioner for said land, said deed being exhibit ‘A,’ and demanded a fulfillment of said contract and pay for his property, according to contract; whereupon said Commissioners Court, acting on behalf and for said county, refused to accept said deeds and pay for said property, for no other or better reason than that said contract was distasteful to some persons, and subjected said commissioners to some adverse criticism. Petitioner alleges that he has in all things complied with the letter and spirit of said contract. That on the faith thereof, and relying upon the good faith of said Commissioners Court, he purchased said roadway at a cost of $300, for which petitioner has no other use than to comply with his said contract. That said roadway would not have been purchased except to comply with said contract, and said Commissioners Court and Guadalupe County was aware of the fact when said executory contract was made, that if petitioner furnished a road so as to enable him to comply with said contract, that he would have to purchase the same.” Prayer for enforcement of the contract. Exhibit “A” is a general warranty deed by plaintiff and his wife to the county for 271 acres of land, acknowledged in due form, deed dated November 15, 1888. Exhibit “ B” is as follows: “ Saturday, October 13, 1888. “ Court met pursuant to adjournment. County judge and all the commissioners present, and proceeded to business. “ In the matter of purchasing a farm for a poor farm: “Motion was made by J. N. Bishop, and seconded by R. D. McGee, to accept Wm. H. Johnston’s bid, upon the condition that he furnished a 40-foot open road from his northwest corner to the Seguin and Gonzales road, on suitable ground; which motion being put to a vote, was carried. J. N. Bishop and R. D. McGee voting yea; F. C. Weinert and F. M. Beyer voting nay. There being a tie vote, the county judge decided the motion by voting yea. “It is further ordered that W. H. Johnston have until November term of the court to accept.’ ’ The general demurrer and special exception should have been sustained. No legal liability on the part of the county is alleged. It is not enough to state that a contract was made, as shown in the exhibit, but the legal obligations created by the contract should have been set forth by appropriate averments. Exhibit “ B” may be evidence of a contract, but its terms can not take the place of allegations of its legal effect. The pleader must make “ a full and clear statement of the cause of action, and such other allegations pertinent to the cause as plaintiff may deem necessary to sustain his suit.” A historical statement of the transactions between the parties is not such a statement. The legal import of the transactions and the undertakings imposed must be stated, as well as the failure to perform them. The allegation of performance on the part of plaintiff, and the failure of performance on the part of defendant, may be sufficiently stated, if it had been shown what was required to be performed.

This being the condition of the ease, we are not required to consider other assignments of error claimed to have occurred on the trial. The judgment of the court below should be reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered. Reversed and remanded.","Guadalupe County v. William Johnston. No. 51. 1.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. This case turns upon the sufficiency of the certificate of acknowledgment to a power of attorney, which appears to have been executed by Isabella Moores and her husband, A. D. Moores, to one John R. Peterson, authorizing him to make conveyance of the land in controversy, which was the separate property of Mrs. Moores by inheritance from her father and mother, James and Susan Philips. The certificate is as follows: “ The State of Texas, Nueces County.—Before me, Cornelius Cahill, a justice of the peace and ex officio notary public in and for said county, personally came Albert D. Moores, to me well known, and to me acknowledged that he executed the foregoing instrument of writing, dated October 25, 1877, and that he signed, sealed, and delivered the same for the purposes and considerations therein stated.' Also personally came Mrs. Isabella Moores, wife of the said Albert D. Moores, parties to the foregoing power of attorney or.instrument of writing, dated the day and year above written, who having been examined by me privily and apart from her said husband, and the said instrument having been fully to her, acknowledged the same to be her own act and deed, and that she willingly signed, sealed, and delivered the same for the purposes, uses, and considerations therein stated, and that she wished not to retract. 11 In testimony whereof, I hereunto sign my name and affix my notarial seal, this October 25, 1877. [Seal] “ C. Cahill, “Justice of the Peace and Ex Officio Notary Public.” The objections urged to the certificate are: 1. It does not appear that Mrs. Isabella Moores was known to the officer who took the acknowledgment to be the person who executed the instrument. 2. It does not appear from the certificate of the notary that the contents of the instrument were fully explained to the said Isabella Moores. 3. It does not appear from the certificate that Mrs. Moores stated to the officer that she wished not to retract said instrument. We are of the opinion that the certificate of acknowledgment was fatally defective on account of the omission of the word “ explained ” in the certificate of the officer. McKie v. Anderson, 78 Texas, 210; Huff v. Webb, 64 Texas, 284. The third objection is not well taken. About the first we express no opinion. Defendants in their answer set up the payment of the purchase money by them and the receipt thereof by Mrs. Moores, and prayed that she be compelled to return it, with interest, before she should be allowed to recover the land. An exception to this portion of the answer was overruled; and the court admitted testimony, over the objections of appellants, that Peterson, the attorney in fact, received the sum of §2434.50 as the purchase money of the land in controversy, and paid the same to the heirs of James Philips, deceased; and that A. D. Moores received for his wife from Peterson §350 on account of all lands sold by him in Refugio and Goliad Counties. Neither the allegations in the answer nor the proof admitted by the court presented any defense to a recovery of the land by Mrs. Moores. The case was tried below without a jury, and it appears from the evidence that the interest of Mrs. Moores in the land is seven-twenty-fourths, and that its rental value is 5 cents per acre. Judgment of the court below will be reversed as to the appellants and here rendered in favor of Mrs. Moores for an undivided interest in seven-twenty-fourths of the land in controversy, and all costs except her proportional share of costs of partition; and that the cause be remanded for partition and setting apart to Mrs. Moores of the seven-twenty-fourths of said land here decreed to her; and the District Court will ascertain and adjust the rents and improvements in accordance with the statute. Reversed, and reformed, and remanded for partition. Delivered February 16, 1893. Justice Pleasants did not sit in this case.","A. D. Moores & Wife v. John Linney et al. No. 66. 1. Certificate of Acknowledgment of a married woman being objected to, upon the ground that it did not appear therefrom that the wife was known to the officer who took the acknowledgment to be the person who executed the instrument, no opinion is expressed, the certificate being held invalid on another ground. 2. Same—Fully Explained.—The officer having failed to certify that the instrument was fully explained to the wife, the acknowledgment is held defective for that reason. Following McKie v. Anderson, 78 Texas, 210. 3. Same—Wished not to Retract.—The language of the closing part of the certificate being “and that she wished not to retract,” the absence of the word “ it” does not invalidate the certificate. 4. Return of Purchase Money.—Suit being by Mrs. Moores, as heir of the former owner, for her interest in the lands in controversy, and the power of attorney given by her and her husband to Peterson being invalid, the fact that Peterson received the purchase money of the land in controversy, and that A. D. Moores received for his wife from Peterson §350 on account of all lands sold by him in Refugio and Goliad counties, does not make it necessary that the wife should be compelled to return her proportion of the purchase money, with interest, before she could recover her interest in the land. 5. Reversed and Rendered.—The interest of Mrs. Moores fixed, and case reversed and rendered in her favor. Appeal from Goliad. Tried below before Hon. H. Cl at Pleasants. G. E. Pope and D. D. Claiborne, for appellants. 1. On October 25, 1877, the law required that the officer taking an acknowledgment should note in his certificate that the person making such acknowledgment was known to him, or that he had satisfactory evidence of her identity, which evidence should be stated in his certificate.

A deed or other instrument conveying or granting power to convey land, the separate property of a married woman, is inoperative as a conveyance, and not entitled to record, unless acknowledged by her after privy examination and a full explanation of the instrument to her, as required by statute.

Marshall, 59 Texas, 296; Johnson v. Bryan, 62 Texas, 623. 3. An instrument which conveys or authorizes the conveyance of the separate property of a married woman, if defectively acknowledged, is void, and can not be the basis of an equity, unless she is guilty of some positive act of fraud or concealment, which must be proven by the party asserting it.

The court did not err in admitting in evidence the power of attorney from Moores and wife and others to Peterson, of date October 25, 1877, to sell land in this State, because it sufficiently authorized Peterson to sell and convey land, and was sufficiently and properly acknowledged for record.

"PLEASANTS, Associate Justice. The appellee instituted this suit in April, 1891, against appellant, for the recovery of compensation for alleged mental suffering inflicted, as averred by appellee, upon him by the appellant, through the failure of its servants to deliver promptly a message sent over appellant’s line of telegraph, on the night of the 11th of July, 1890, by appellee, from Thompson, in Fort Bend County, addressed to Dr. Fields, at Alvin, in Galveston County, requesting him to ■come by next train to appellee’s house at Thompson, to see a child of appellee’s, who was very sick. The petition averred, that for four days previous to the 11th of July, 1890, the plaintiff’s child was sick, and on that day it grew worse, and plaintiff became anxious, and about 10 o’clock p. m. of that day he delivered to the operator at Thompson, the servant of defendant who was engaged in transmitting messages over defendant’s telegraphic lines between Thompson and Alvin, the following message: “ Thompson, Texas, July 11, 1890. “Dr. Fields, Alvin, Texas: “ Come up next train; child very sick. “ V. E. Beedine.” That said message was delivered to said operator, to be by him transmitted over defendant’s line of telegraph to Alvin, and there delivered by defendant’s servants at Alvin to Dr. Fields. That plaintiff informed the operator at Thompson, to whom he delivered said message, of the illness of his child, and the purport of the message, and paid the operator his charge for transmitting same, to-wit, 25 cents. That Dr. Fields was a resident of Alvin; had resided there for a long time; that his residence was within 300 yards of defendant’s office in said town. That a daily train arrived at Thompson from Alvin, reaching Thompson about 8 o’clock a. m., the two towns being about twenty miles distant from each other. That defendant’s servants failed to transmit and deliver said message to Dr. Fields promptly, and willfully neglected to deliver the same until 12 o’clock m. of the 12th of July, 1890; that the doctor was at home in Alvin, and if the message had been promptly delivered to him by defendant’s servants, he might and would have come from Alvin to plaintiff’s residence, if not by an earlier train, by the morning train of the 12th of July, and would have reached plaintiff’s residence about 8 o’clock a. m. of that day; but that by the neglect of defendant’s servants to deliver said message promptly, the physician was unable to see plaintiff’s child until about 8 o’clock p. m. of the 12th of July. That the child had continued to grow worse, and was suffering from congestion when the physician arrived, and died on the following day about 8 p.m.; and that petitioner suffered great anguish of mind because of his inability to procure the attendance of a physician upon his dying child; and it prayed damages in the sum of 81999.99. To this petition defendant filed general demurrer and general denial, and specially pleaded, that when plaintiff delivered the message to defendant’s servant at Thompson, said servant then informed plaintiff that the office at Alvin did not deliver messages at night, and that the message would not be delivered on the morning of the 12th in time for Doctor Fields to come to Thompson on the train arriving at that place from Alvin at 8 o’clock a. m., and that the doctor could not reach plaintiff’s house, if he came by rail, before the night of the 12th of July. The case was called for trial on the 19th of October, 1891, and defendant moved the court to grant it a contiunance. The application for continuance was in substance as follows: “ Now comes the defendant in the above numbered and entitled cause, and moves the court to grant a continuance of this cause to the next term of this court for the want of the testimony of W. A. Cole, defendant’s agent at Thompson’s Switch at the time plaintiff filed the message about the delay in the delivery of which he brings this suit, and represents, that such testimony is material for the defense of defendant, and that said W. A. Cole is no longer in the employ of defendant, and that defendant has used every means, by telegraphing, writing, and otherwise, through and by its several agents, to ascertain the whereabouts of the said W. A. Ctile, but has been unable, though it has used all diligence to ascertain the residence of the said W. A. Cole, to do so, and in consequence has been unable to issue due process to obtain the testimony of the said witness; and that the testimony of the said W. A. Cole can not be obtained from any other source; wherefore defendant prays, that justice may be done, that this cause be continued to the next term of this court.” This application was refused, and defendant excepted. Trial was had, and a verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiff in the precise sum prayed for in the petition. Motion for new trial overruled, and defant excepted and gave notice of appeal. Four errors are assigned. The first is that of the refusal of the court to grant a continuance of the cause. The application shows that the defendant had not attempted to obtain the testimony through legal process, and it avers, as the reason for not having used the statutory means for obtaining the desired testimony, that the witness was not then in the employment of defendant, and that his residence was.unknown to defendant, although defendant had used er cry means by telegraphing and writing to ascertain the whereabouts of the witness. It needs neither citation of authorities nor argument to show that such an application is insufficient for the purpose of showing proper diligence by defendant to find the witness. The defendant was cited to answer plaintiff’s suit on the 23d of April, 1891, and its motion for a continuance was made on the 19th of October of the same year. But the application does not inform the court when the witness left the employment of defendant; when the inquiries as to his residence were made by defendant; nor to whom, nor to what place or places, its letters or telegrams were directed. Nor does the application aver even a probability that the testimony can be had at some time in the future, not unreasonably distant. The motion was properly overruled. Another error assigned is the refusal of the following charge requested by the defendant: “ You are charged, that though the defendant may be guilty of negligence in failing promptly to deliver the message to Dr. Fields, yet if the plaintiff could have obtained medical attention—if he could have gotten another doctor—and by his negligence failed to do so, then yon will not find any damages for the plaintiff for the mental anguish suffered by him after the time he could have obtained such a doctor, as his omission to obtain such a doctor would have been contributory negligence on his part.” This charge is plainly upon the weight of the evidence, inasmuch as it assumes that the omission of the plaintiff to obtain another doctor, after the nonarrival of Dr. Fields on the morning train of the 12th of July, was per se contributory negligence. Whether any act or omission be negligence or not, unless it be so declared by law, is a question for the jury, which they must determine from the definition of negligence given them by the court, and the evidence before them. The fourth assignment of error is: “ The judgment is contrary to the law and the evidence, because the damage sued for by the plaintiff was such as is known to the law as exemplary damages, and the plaintiff failed to allege and prove such facts as would enable him to recover exemplary damages against a corporation.” The plaintiff does not sue for exemplary damages. His suit is for the recovery of compensatory damages for mental suffering, which he avers was the proximate result of defendant’s breach of its contract with plaintiff to deliver within a reasonable time his message to Dr. Fields. That mental suffering which is the proximate result of a breach of contract may form the basis for compensatory damages, is not now a debatable question in this State. Stuart v. Tel. Co., 66 Texas, 585, and cases there referred to. The third assignment of error is, that the damages are excessive. The evidence shows that the telegram was received by the operator at Alvin sometime between 10 and 11 o’clock of the night of the 11th of July; that it was not delivered to Dr. Fields until 11 o’clock a. m. on the 12th; and that had it been delivered promptly the doctor would have reached the residence of plaintiff about 8 o’clock a. m. of the 12th, if not at an earlier hour of that day; that by his failure to receive the message he did not see plaintiff’s child until 8 o’clock p. m. of the same day; that the child was a sufferer all during that day, with no physician upon attendance to alleviate its pain; and it shows also that the father suffered much distress on account of the child and Ms failure to procure the services of a doctor for it, and that the child died some twenty hours after the arrival of the physician. On the other hand, the evidence shows that the child had been sick with fever for four days before the telegram was sent to Dr. Fields, and that on the morning of the 12th, after the train from Alvin had arrived, without bringing Dr. Fields, the plaintiff was advised by a neighbor and visitor to send for Dr. Cochrane, who resided at Stafford, which place was about eight miles distant, and on the opposite side of the Brazos River from Thompson; that there was a skiff upon which passengers were carried over the river between these two points; but this advice was rejected by the plaintiff, who believed, as he declared, that Dr. Fields would come to the child. The evidence also shows, that the plaintiff could have had but little reason to expect Dr. Fields to reach his house earlier than the hour for the arrival of the train from Alvin, which hour was 8 o’clock a. m., so that the time between the expected and the actual arrival of the doctor was 12 hours. The plaintiff, it must be borne in mind, is not suing for the recovery of damages for the death of his child, but for damages founded upon the alleged mental anguish suffered by him between the time when the doctor should have arrived and the time when he did arrive. The question is, therefore, Are the damages under the evidence excessive ? The law, it is true, has not fixed any rule for measuring damages in such cases, and the measure of the damages rests in the discretion of the jury. But this is a judicial discretion, to be exercised by the jury without bias or prejudice to either party; and if there be evidence in the case which makes it probable that the minds of the jury were warped by passion in reaching their conclusion, the verdict should be set aside. If the plaintiff might have procured the services of another physician at an earlier hour than that at which the child was first seen by Dr. Fields, as is insisted by appellant plaintiff could have done, the failure of plaintiff to do this would not bar his claim for damages. Such failure or neglect of the parent would not be contributory negligence, in the sense at least to relieve the appellant of negligence in failing to deliver the message within a reasonable time after it was received at Alvin. But if it be a fact that the parent might have procured another physician to minister to his child between the hours of the arrival of the morning train from Alvin and the hour of Dr. Fields’ arrival, such fact should be considered by the jury in fixing the measure of damages. If another physician could have and had been obtained, the duration of plaintiff’s anguish would have been necessarily shortened; and if he would have been subjected to mental suffering for want of a physician only between the arrival of the morning train from Alvin and the hour when the physician from Stafford would have arrived, then surely plaintiff should not recover damages for the whole time between the expected and the actual arrival of Dr. Fields; for it is not alleged, nor can we presume such to be the fact, that the plaintiff reposed special confidence in the skill of Dr. Fields, and that his grief was that the service of this particular physician could not be had for the suffering child. In view of the whole evidence, we are of the opinion that it is probable that sympathy for the parent influenced the jury in fixing the damages, and that the damages are excessive. The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the cause is remanded for another trial. Reversed and remanded. Delivered March 9, 1893.","Western Union Telegraph Company v. V. E. Berdine. No. 104. 1. Continuance—Insufficient Application.—An application based upon the want of the evidence of a former employe who had left the company’s service, and whose whereabouts is unknown, which does not inform the court when the witness left the employment of defendant, when the inquiries as to his evidence were made, nor to whom nor to what place or places letters and telegrams were directed, and which does not aver a probability that the testimony can be had at some future time, and which is made nearly six months after the suit was filed, is insufficient. 2. Contributory Negligence in Suit for Damages for Mental Anguish.—Suit being for damages for mental anguish, caused by failure to deliver a message calling a physician to the bedside of a sick child, who afterward died; a charge directing the jury not to find any damages for mental anguish suffered by plaintiff after the time when he could have obtained another doctor, as his omission to obtain such doctor would have been contributory negligence, was properly refused. It would have been a charge on the weight of evidence. 3. Mental Anguish as a Basis for Damages.—That mental suffering which is the proximate result of a breach of contract, may form the basis for compensatory damages, is not now a debatable question in this State. 4. Excessive Damages. — Suit was by ,a parent for damages for mental anguish, and the exact sum claimed in the petition and found by the jury was $1999.99; the services of another physician eight miles distant might have been secured; the child had been sick four days before the physician was telegraphed for. It is probable that sympathy for the parent influenced the jury, and the verdict is set aside as excessive. Appeal from Fort Bend. Tried below before Hon. Wm. H. Burk-hart.

The verdict of the jury is excessive, in that it gave appellee the full amount he sued for, or $1999.99, as pain and anguish suffered on account of the fact that no doctor was present with his sick child.

"TARLTON, Chief Justice. The appellee, Michael-S. Vaught, recovered, in the District Court of Mitchell County, in this action of trespass to try title, a judgment against the appellant for a section of land involved in this suit, and a further judgment in the sum of $78.95, the value of the use and occupancy of said land for two years prior to the .institution of said suit; From this judgment the appellant prosecutes this appeal. The defendant pleaded a disclaimer as to the title and possession of the survey sued for, and denied possession of it. Conclusions of fact. 1. Plaintiff was and is the owner of the section of land sued for. 2. Since May 4, 1887, two years prior to the institution of this suit, the land has been within the enclosure of the St. Louis Cattle Company. - 3. The enclosure of said company is used by the same as a pasture, and the cattle of said company were permitted to graze upon the said survey in controversy, as well as upon any other portion of the land enclosed in their pasture — the outer boundaries of the tract sued for having never been fenced. 4. The rental value of the land in controversy, for the two years prior to the institution of the suit, is §78.95. 5. The pasture of the St. Louis Cattle Company consists of 75,000 or 100,000 acres of land, with a large number of cattle in the same. 6. Before the pasture was fenced by the company, the southern line thereof had been fenced by the Lucerne Cattle Company. A considerable portion of the eastern boundary thereof had also been fenced by the Lucerne Cattle Company, the fence so built being still owned by the Lucerne company. 7. A portion of the western boundary of the pasture had been fenced by the Iowa Cattle Company, and was and is still the property of said Iowa company. . 8. The St. Louis Cattle Company used these fences and assisted in keeping them in repair. The balance of the enclosure was fenced by said company in the spring of 1887, no part of said fence being upon the land sued for. 9. The St. Louis Cattle Company built and established gates, every three miles, around its pasture; and ingress and egress through said gates to and from the land sued for has never been denied to the plaintiff. 10. The St. Louis Cattle Companj' notified the agents of plaintiff that he could at any time take possession of his land, and protect and use the same, and that if enclosed within its pasture, this was only so done that the company might use and enjoy its own lands as a pasture, such being the purpose for which they were purchased, and that the company could not pay rent for the plaintiff’s tract, as it had been advised that"" it was not liable for rent, as demanded by plaintiff’s agents, under the circumstances of its enclosure. The two assignments of error filed by the appellant complain of the action of the court in instructing the jury as shown by the third paragraph of its charge, and in refusing the special charge asked by the defendant. The third paragraph referred to is as follows: Delivered November 29, 1892. “If you find from the evidence that the defendant built and erected a fence completely enclosing a quantity of land, in which enclosure it embraced the survey sued for, and you find defendant is using the land sued for in the same manner it is using the other part of such larger enclosure, for the grazing of cattle, then the defendant is in possession of said survey No. 23; and if .you so find, you will also find for plaintiff the value (if any) of the use and occupation of said survey No. 23, for the time said survey lias been so embraced and used, not, however, giving the value of the use and occupation for a longer time than from May 4, 1887 [a date two years prior to the bringing of the suit], to the present time.” The special charge referred to is as follows: “ If the defendant, in enclosing its own land, which surrounded the land of plaintiff, necessarily enclosed the land of plaintiff, but made no claim of title to same, and placed none of its fences on plaintiff’s land, and did not refuse plaintiff the use and occupation thereof, but offered him free access thereto, the plaintiff could not be allowed to recover rent. ’ ’ In this State, on account of the condition which has existed from time immemorial of the grazing lands, the owner of such property can not complain, as long as it remains a portion of the “ commons,” that the cattle of another should roam over it and graze upon it at will. Davis v. Davis, 70 Texas, 123; Buford v. Houtz, 133 U. S., 320. This doctrine, however, does not authorize the owner of cattle, by affirmative conduct on his part, to appropriate the use of such lands to his own benefit. He will not be permitted thus to ignore the truth that every one is entitled to the exclusive enjoyment of his own property. In this case, the appellant, by means of fences constructed or maintained by it, enclosed the land of the appellee in such manner as to reap from it those benefits which, as a rule, are incident exclusively to ownership. The use and enjoyment of the property under such circumstances imports necessarily the idea of liability. The charge complained of involves the conclusions reached by us, and is therefore, in our opinion, proper. It hence follows, also, that the instruction requested was correctly refused. The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed. Justice Head did not sit in this case.","The Saint Louis Cattle Company v. M. S. Vaught. No. 40. Rents — Enclosure of Small Tract within Large Pastúre. — Where the owner of several tracts of land, in enclosing them within one large enclosure,, necessarily encloses a tract belonging to another, this is an appropriation of such other, person's land, and the pasture owner is liable in trespass to try title for rental value of the tract thus enclosed, although the pasture fence contains gates every three miles, and the pasture owner disclaims title and possession of such tract. ■ ... Appeal from Mitchell. Tried below before Hon. Wm. Kennedy. Alexander & Campbell and Martin & Jones, for appellants. 1. If the defendant, in enclosing its own • land, which surrounded the, land of plaintiff, necessarily enclosed the land of plaintiff, but made no claim of title to same, and placed none of its fences on plaintiff’s land, and did not refuse plaintiff the use and occupation thereof, but offered him free access thereto, the plaintiff could not be allowed to recover rents. If there was any servitude on defendant’s land in favor of plaintiff, giving him a way of necessity, the defendant had-, provided such way by the erection of gates; and it even does not appear that the gates were not near the land and convenient. But the owner of the servient tenement has the right to designate a way of necessity to suit his own convenience. Russell v. Jackson, 2 Pick., 574; Washb. on Ease., 3 ed., 237, par. 10. 2. Under the pleadings, being an action of trespass to try title, and for damages, the evidence showing the plaintiff had privilege of ingress and egress, even if he had a technical right.of way which was denied him by defendant, he can not recover ■ rents certainly on this record. Sup. Ct., Austin Term, May 10, 1891. 3. If it should be claimed that plaintiff has a right to a way under section 5 of statute of January 30, 1884, General Laws, 69, then we say that this would not entitle him to a recovery of rents under the pleadings and evidence. And further, the statute is in conflict with the Constitution, in practically authorizing the appropriation of the property and labor of one to the use of another without compensation. Railway v. Rowland, 70 Texas, 305; Const., art. 1, secs. 13, 16, 17. No briefs for appellee have reached' the Reporter."
"KEY, Associate Justice. This is an action of trespass to try title. Appellant was plaintiff in the District Court. After showing title from the government down to Mrs. Maria Jesusa Lee to the land sued for, •plaintiff introduced in evidence a personal judgment in favor of James Denson and others against James B. Lee and Maria Jesusa Lee for $1500, rendered by the District Court of Bexar County, October 21,1858. This judgment did not direct the sale of Mrs. Lee’s separate property. On this judgment an execution was issued in December, 1858, against J. B. and Maria Jesusa Lee, directed to the sheriff of Bexar County, and the land here involved was sold by said sheriff under this execution, on the first Tuesday in February, 1859, to appellant; and the sheriff executed to him a deed therefor March 5, 1859. At the time the judgment was rendered Mrs. Lee was a married woman, wife of J. B. Lee. Frio and several other counties were created out of part of the territory of Bexar County by an act of the Legislature dated February 1, 1858, which took effect from its passage. Medina County was organized in 1849, and terms of the District Courts-were regularly held up to and including 1858 and 1859; and during said last two years it was the nearest organized county to Frio. The land involved is in Frio County. The court excluded the sheriff’s deed from the evidence, and appellant declining to take a nonsuit, judgment was rendered in favor of defendant. Two objections urged against the sheriff’s deed under which appellant claims were sustained by the trial court. These were: First. That as the judgment under which the sale was made did not by its terms direct the sale of Mrs. Lee’s separate property, she being at the time a married woman, the sale and deed were void. Second. That under the act of the Legislature creating Frio County, it was attached to Medina County for judicial purposes; and that the land being in Frio County, the execution should have been issued to and sale-made by the sheriff of Medina County; and that the sale made by the sheriff of Bexar County was a nullity and passed no title. 1. While there are respectable authorities which hold, that unless authorized by and rendered in accordance with a statute, a judgment against a married woman is void and of no effect whatever, there are many others that declare such judgments to be only erroneous or voidable, and that until set aside, the separate property of the wife may be sold under process issued thereon. Black on Judg., secs. 188, 190, 191, and cases cited. The reason generally given by courts holding such judgments to be absolutely void is, that by the common law, on account of the merger of the wife’s personality in that of the husband, she was incapacitated for almost every species of juristic action. Ib., sec. 188. As is clearly shown by Chief Justice Hemphill in Jones v. Taylor, 7 Texas, 240, the reason for such a rule does not exist in this State; but previous to that decision, the question under consideration had been detennined in Howard v. North, 5 Texas, 290, wherein it was held, that a sale of the wife’s separate property under a personal judgment against her, as against a collateral attack, was valid and passed title. See, also, Taylor v. Harris, 21 Texas, 438. The first objection to the deed should have been overruled. 2. In was held in O’Shea v. Twohig, 9 Texas, 336, that when a new county is created out of part of the territory of an existing organized county, the territory embraced in the new county remains part of the mother county, for all governmental purposes, until the new county is organized, or attached for such purposes to some other organized county. That case was approved and followed in Clark v. Goss, 12 Texas, 396, and Lumpkin v. Muncey, 66 Texas, 311. Under the doctrine of these cases, the execution sale under which appellant claims was properly made in Bexar County, unless, for the purpose of such sales, by some statute then in force, Frio County, in which the land was situated, was at that time attached to some other organized county. In support of the proposition that Frio County had been thus segregated, appellee invokes the twenty-ninth section of the act creating that and other counties, which was in force at the date of the judgment, execution, and sale under which appellant claims, and which reads as follows: “ That until attached by law to some judicial district or districts, each of said counties shall be attached for judicial purposes, in matters appertaining to the jurisdiction of the District Court, to the nearest county in which the District Court may be held.” Under the facts disclosed by the record, for the purposes stated in this statute, Frio County was at the time in question attached to Medina County; and the question for determination is, whether or not the purposes for which it was so detached from Bexar and attached to Medina County include a sheriff’s sale of land in Frio County made under an execution issued upon a judgment of a District Court other than that of Medina County. The solution of this question is not free from difficulty. If the statute read, for judicial purposes, without qualification, the case would fall within the doctrine announced in Folts v. Ferguson, 77 Texas, 301, and the ruling of the court below would be clearly correct. But such is not the case. It contains limitations, both express and implied, that take it out of the general rule declared in that case. We think the controlling purpose of the section referred to was to furnish the people of the newly created counties the most convenient courts in which to conduct their important litigation and perform the greater part of their jury service. In our view, this provision should be construed as though it read thus: “ That until by law attached to some judicial district or districts, each of said counties shall be attached to the nearest county in which District Courts may be held, for judicial purposes in all matters appertaining to the jurisdiction of said courts.” The fact that the Legislature used the expression “ counties in which the District Court may be held ” supports the conclusion that the purpose was to limit the section transferring jurisdiction, not to matters pertaining to the jurisdiction of District Courts generally, but to such matters as appertained to the jurisdiction of the District Courts of the particular counties to which the new counties were attached. As we adopt this construction, it becomes unnecessary for us to determine the extent of the power and authority that was conferred upon the District Courts to which it is limited. It did more, however, than prescribe venue for legal proceedings. It constituted Frio a part of Medina County as to all proceedings in the District Court of the latter. Whether or not this would include execution sales under judgments rendered by the District Court of Medina County need not be determined in this case. But in all matters pertaining to or founded upon proceedings in other courts, whether Supreme, District, County, or Justice Courts, jurisdiction remained with Bexar, the parent county. It can not be disputed, that while this law was in force Bexar County was the proper and necessary place to sell real estate in Frio County, under an execution issued upon a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court or by a justice of the peace. Bexar County retained jurisdiction in all proceedings in probate matters, and over all suits and proceedings below District Court jurisdiction, including sales of real estate under execution. It remained the place to record deeds, to pay taxes; and when necessary to sell real estate for taxes, Bexar County was the proper place to make such sales. This being the case, is there any thing in the language of the statute warranting the conclusion, that when for so many governmental purposes jurisdiction was left with Bexar County, including all other judicial sales, it was intended that an execution sale under a judgment of a District Court must be made in Medina County ? With the possible exception of sales made under executions from the District Court of Medina County, we think not. At any rate, it is not clear that such was the legislative purpose, and if the statute is ambiguous, considerations of uniformity and harmony in the law suggest the propriety of holding that the mother county was the proper place for such sales. ' As illustrating the confusion which might result from the construction contended for by appellees, suppose two judgments had been rendered against the same defendant, one in the District Court of Travis County and the other in a Justice of the Peace Court of the same county. To have subjected land in Frio County belonging to the judgment debtor to the payment of these judgments, would it have been necessary to issue one execution to Bexar County and the other to Medina County ? According to appellee’s contention, it would. A construction leading to such incongruities ought not to be adopted, unless the language of the statute precludes any more reasonable interpretation. This statute, by its very terms, takes from the mother county only part of its jurisdiction for judicial purposes. It follows, therefore, that no construction can be placed upon it—unless it be restricted to fixing venue only—which will not be productive of some confusion; but we believe the one which we have adopted will more nearly harmonize it with other laws and effectuate the legislative purpose than would the adoption of the interpretation contended for by appellees. We therefore conclude that the court below erred in sustaining the second objection to the sheriff’s deed. Some other objections were urged against the deed, but they are not of such importance as to require extended discussion. In our opinion, they were correctly overruled. The judgment of the District Court is reversed and cause remanded. Reversed and remanded. Delivered February 8, 1893.","R. A. Henson v. William Sackville. No. 59. 1.

Medina County was organized in 1849, and therein District Courts were regularly held up to and including 1858 and 1859. In the act creating Frio County it was prescribed, “that until attached by law to some judicial district or districts each •of said counties [Fric and others] shall be attached for judicial purposes in matters appertaining to the jurisdiction of the District Court, to the nearest county in which the District Court may be held.” Medina was the nearest county to Frio in which was held a District Court.

"GARRETT, Chief Justice. Action by Jas. K. Clarke & Co. against the East Texas Fire Insurance Company, to recover on a policy of insurance, written by the defendant, upon a saw mill situated in the State of Florida. The defense is, that the policy was rendered void on account of the violation of the conditions thereof by the execution of a mortgage upon the insured property by Jas. It. Clarke, a member of the firm of Jas. It. Clarke & Co. . Trial was had by a jury, and verdict and judgment were for the plaintiffs. This is the second appeal. On the first it was held that the mortgage was prohibited by the conditions of the policy. 79 Texas, 23. The case now before us turns upon the question as to whether or not the mortgage which was executed by the plaintiff Jas. K. Clarke was ever delivered. . It was shown by the-evidence, that on August 16, 1887, Jas. K. Clarke was indebted to the Southern Bank of the State of Georgia in a sum of money, for which he executed his promissory note, payable to said bank or order; and that on the same day, in order to secure his note, he executed a mortgage to the bank on land in Alabama, and the saw mill and machinery, situated on leased land in Florida, covered by the policy of insurance sued on. It was in usual form, purporting to be executed by Clarke alone, and contained no reference to his wife or her right of dower. It was properly acknowledged, and was delivered to Mr. Crane, the vice president of the bank, by the attorney of Clarke, and on August 29, 1887, the cashier of the bank sent it to Florida for record, and it was recorded there August 31, .1887. The property was destroyed by fire October 8, 1887. On the trial in the court below evidence was admitted, over the objection of the defendant, to the effect, that when the mortgage was executed it was intended that Mrs. Clarke, the wife of the plaintiff, who executed the mortgage, should waive her dower interests in the property; that it was delivered to Mr. Crane, the vice president of the bank, with that understanding; and that plaintiff Jas. K. Clarke did not intend that the mortgage should become operative or effective until such dower rights had been waived, and so told Mr. Crane. A bill of exception was taken, and the action of the court in admitting the evidence has been assigned as error. The mortgage is perfect on its face, and bears no evidence that Mrs. Clarke was to unite in its execution. Parol evidence was not admissible to prove that it was not to become operative as a deed until it should be completed by the waiver of dower interest by Mrs. Clarke. The mortgage was delivered to the bank by the attorney of Clarke; it was accepted by the bank and recorded. This is fatal to the contention that it was delivered as an escrow, only to become operative on the performance of a condition, “ for a deed can never be an escrow if delivered to the grantee himself, unless for the express purpose of being handed to another person, even though accompanied with an express condition, and not to take effect unless such condition is complied with.” 3 Waslib. Real Prop., 584. It was said by the Supreme Court of Georgia, in the case of Jordan v. Pollock, 14 Georgia, 154, in discussing the question, that a stubborn principle of law interfered and declared that a deed delivered to the grantee could not be an escrow: 1 ‘ One of those stern technical rules which the law, generalizing for the public good, establishes as controlling intention, and serving as lights and guides to the wayfarer in search of legal rights. That rule is, that a deed can never be delivered to the grantee himself as an escrow; but if intended to operate as such, must be delivered to a third person for him. If a deed be delivered to him, the law, for wise purposes and on just principles, vests the interests convej-ed instantly in him.” This rule is inflexible and unvarying. The exception stated by Mr. Washburn, “ unless for the express purpose of being-handed to another person,” is in fact no exception, for in that instance it is not a delivery, but the grantee is made the mere agent to deliver the deed to another person. Tiedeman, in his work on Real Property, also states the rule, and collates quite a number of authorities. Sec. 815. In Hargrave v. Melbourne (Alabama), 5 Southern Reporter, 285, it was contended that the wife of one of the grantors was to unite in the execution of the deed, which had been delivered to one of the grantees, and that the deed was not complete; but it was held that the delivery of a deed, complete on its face, to the grantee, is an absolute delivery, whatever conditions may be orally annexed .to qualify or postpone its operation, and it was not competent to prove by parol evidence that it was an escrow. The court erred in admitting the evidence as complained of. We think, moreover, that all the evidence before the court, including that which was erroneously admitted over the objections of these defendants, conclusively shows that the mortgage was executed and delivered; that it was a valid mortgage, and was binding upon the interest of Jas. K. Clarke in the property mortgaged, notwithstanding the fact that when it was delivered there was an understanding that Mrs. Clarke was to release her dower interest in the property, and that it was not complete without such release. There was no condition to be performed by the bank, and the delivery as to Clarke himself was absolute. Delivered November 17, 1892. We deem it unnecessary to inquire whether Mrs. Clarke had a dower interest in the property or not, as the mortgage was complete and absolute without the release. It is not necessary to notice the remaining assignments of error further than to say that Clarke should not have been permitted to testify as to what his intention was when the mortgage was delivered. The judgment of the court below will be reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.","East Texas Fire Insurance Company v. James K. Clarke & Co. No. 21. 1. Conditional Delivery of Mortgage. — Appellee having sued appellant upon afire insurance policy upon property in Florida, was met by the defense that it was void, because of a violation of its conditions by reason of the execution of a mortgage upon the property insured; to which it was replied, that the mortgage was never delivered; that it was handed to the grantee with the understanding that the wife of the grantor should waive her dower interest in the property, and was not intended to become operative until that was done. The mortgage contained no reference to the wife or her right of dower, and the court erred in admitting parol evidence of the understanding alleged. But all the evidence, including that erroneously admitted, shows that it was executed and delivered, and that it was a valid mortgage upon appellee's interest in the property, although when delivered there was an' understanding that the dower interest was to be released. There was no condition to be performed by the grantee, and as to appellee the delivery was absolute. 2. Escrow — Delivery.—A deed can never be delivered to the grantee himself as an escrow, but if intended to operate as such must be delivered to a third person for him.
